• in the us people of color represent approximately 13 of our senior leadership team 34 of our management roles and 31 of our overall workforce 

the following shows our attrition rate for the year ended december 31 2021 



in 2020 we experienced historically low attrition rates in 2021 we experienced a higher rate of retirement combined with a very competitive talent market which resulted in slightly higher attrition rates compared to 2019 we have continued to attract a strong diverse pipeline of talent hiring at record levels to support both inorganic and organic growth enabling future success 

stewardship health safety and environmental 

we focus on more than the occupational health and safety of our employees contractors and any visitors to our sites we have an expanded view and measurement of stewardship that includes process safety and releases to the environment since these incidents may have an impact on the communities where we live and work our stewardship values are critical to our success in attracting and retaining the best industry talent across the globe 

we strive to do no harm to people the environment or the communities that host our facilities we believe in continuous improvement in our stewardship culture by building competency in our people and having a comprehensive management system built from recognized global practices our values include a commitment to the health and safety of our employees contractors communities and the environment 

we utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the stewardship performance of our operations lagging indicators for occupational health and safety include the occupational safety and health administration osha total recordable incident rate trir and the osha lost time incident rate ltir based upon the number of incidents per 200000 work hours of both employees and contractors process safety lagging indicators follow the industry standard from api rp 754 for tier 1 and tier 2 events for incident count rate and severity the criteria for tracking release to the environment lagging indicators are 10 or greater of the celanese reportable quantity based on us environmental protection agency epa methodology or internal values examples of stewardship tier 3 leading indicators include reporting and resolution of near miss events and hazard recognitions behavioral based safety observations all releases to the environment that fall below the previously mentioned threshold criteria and challenges to process safety systems 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we had a trir of 019 and a ltir of 006 through deliberate actions we have reduced our trir and ltir rates by 39 and 54 respectively since 2017 

rounding out our stewardship performance in 2021 we had 15 tier 1 and tier 2 process safety incidents and 16 releases to the environment above the 10 significant threshold any other loss of primary containment incidents challenges to pressure relief systems safety instrumented systems and safe operating limits are tracked as tier 3 leading indicators our expanded tracking of leading indicator events helps identify potential emerging deficiencies that enables us to take continuous improvement actions for example this past year we concentrated heavily on hand safety awareness the most commonly impacted body part and establishing clear requirements regarding our fundamental life critical procedures and their field execution while focusing to prevent injuries with the most significant consequences

 item 1a   risk factors 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods refer also to the other information set forth in this form 10k including in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

risks related to economic and industry conditions 

we are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the united states us germany china japan south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions for example any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements or the imposition of new or increased tariffs on our products or raw materials or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china may increase costs or reduce profitability or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy in addition it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements collect receivables receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss furthermore in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow or trade flows could be negatively impacted and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales annually and accounted for approximately 36 of our net sales in 2021 adverse conditions in the european economy related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu membership or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth trade disruptions decreased enduse customer demand or other factors 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in our intermediate chemistry business principally acetic acid vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our emulsion polymers and eva polymer businesses primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of acetate tow we also procure polymers rubber and polypropylene for use in production of engineered materials and other raw materials as additives to our products including fiberglass flame retardant materials and other compounding components 

the prices and availability of many of these items is dependent on the available supply and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with inflationary pressures transportation or logistics disruptions weather natural disasters epidemics pandemics the effects of climate change or political instability plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials and energy commodities war terrorist activities civil unrest or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant 

suppliers in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse impacts to our financial results like many companies in 2021 we experienced supply disruptions and increased costs of inputs which we believe led to increased costs and some lost sales as a result of reduced ability to produce products to meet aggregate demand we attempt to pass through costs to customers but even where we are successful increased prices could lead to reduced customer demand for our products or could result in competitive disadvantages we currently expect these issues to continue into 2022 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

• shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand eg from growing uses or new uses 

• capacity constraints eg due to construction delays labor disruption governmentimposed work or travel restrictions involuntary shutdowns or turnarounds 

• a suppliers inability to meet our delivery orders a suppliers decision not to fulfill orders or to terminate a supply contract or our inability to obtain or renew supply contracts on favorable terms 

• the general level of business economic and industry activity and 

• the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation including the impact of government regulation relating to climate change or regulation of production and transport of certain chemicals 

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse impacts to our financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or site services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible that profitability would be adversely affected if we were required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

almost all of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway with mitsui in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas 

our business financial condition and result of operations have been are being and may in the future be significantly and adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and we cannot predict the extent to which these effects may continue or reoccur with greater severity 

substantially all locations where we and our customers and suppliers have offices and production facilities were impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the resulting governmentimposed quarantines stayathome restrictions travel restrictions and other public health and safety measures 

covid19 significantly impacted our operations and financial results during 2020 by slowing down the economy and depressing demand in many of our markets as well as the end customers of products for which our products serve as materials and inputs like most companies we continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of the pandemic 

the extent to which covid19 may continue to impact our operations or those of our customers or suppliers will depend on future developments and numerous factors which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence these include 

• the extent of any resurgence in infections and the spread of the disease or variants thereof and the effectiveness of vaccines or other medical treatments 

• additional governmental business and individual actions to contain the spread of covid19 including social distancing workathome stayathome and shelterinplace orders and shutdowns travel restrictions and quarantines 

• the extent to which these conditions depress economic activity generally and demand for our products specifically and affect the financial markets 

• the effect of the outbreak on our employees customers suppliers supply chain and other business partners 

• our ability during the outbreak to provide our products and services 

• disruptions to our business supply chain or the availability of raw materials caused by plant closures or transportation and shipping disruptions 

• the risk that we could be exposed to liability negative publicity or reputational harm related to any incidents of actual or perceived transmission of covid19 among employees at our facilities 

• the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services during and following the outbreak 

• our ability to access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms and 

• our ability to comply with the financial covenant in our credit agreement if a material and prolonged economic downturn were to result in increased indebtedness or substantially lower ebitda 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and it is unknown if disruptions to our customers demand will recur we have monitored and will continue to monitor the situation closely 

risks related to our global operations and our strategy 

production at our manufacturing facilities or at our suppliers could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems public health crises including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

we have experienced recent disruptions of the type described above in february 2021 winter storm uri led to worldwide supply disruptions loss of energy and critical raw materials at our texas sites and impacted nearly all of our employees in texas where we are headquartered and where several of our manufacturing sites are located this storm led us to proactively and temporarily shut down our texas production facilities in a controlled manner to protect our employees communities and assets and the necessity of this decision led to lost production and negatively impacted our financial results for that quarter in august 2020 to protect our employees and safeguard the assets at our clear lake facility we temporarily voluntarily ceased production at our clear lake texas facility during the landfall of hurricane laura during 2019 production of acetic acid and vam was disrupted due to a localized fire at our clear lake texas facility which caused reduced sales and profits 

disruptions or interruptions of production or operations could also occur due to accidents interruptions in sources of raw materials cybersecurity incidents terrorism or political unrest or other unforeseen events or delays in construction or operation of facilities including as a result of geopolitical conditions the occurrence of acts of war or terrorist incidents or as a result of weather natural disasters or other crises including public health crises 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our engineered materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with applicable quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of and minimize the disruption to our operations and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances in addition we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also monitor intellectual property of others especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development our rights to manufacture 

and market our products and our rights to use knowhow and trade secrets we will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges we also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights or protecting our rights to commercially make market and sell our products our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors furthermore some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or joint venture transactions or successfully integrate them into our business which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates the ability to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to complete a planned transaction and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions and joint venture transactions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations see strategic affiliates in item 1 business and note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures for further information 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and cyberinformation security insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information or operational technology cybersecurity threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced and persistent threats in the areas of information and operational technology security and fraud we seek to prevent unauthorized access to our information and operational technology systems and to detect and investigate any cybersecurity incidents that may occur however in some cases we might be unaware of a particular incident or its magnitude and effects at the current time we may face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during the covid19 pandemic which may create additional information security vulnerabilities andor magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems additionally we may be exposed to unauthorized access to our information or operational technology systems through undetected vulnerabilities in our service providers information systems or software 

the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks including through ransomware or denialofservice attacks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption including the potential to disrupt or compromise our control of physical plant operations at our manufacturing sites reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential or personally identifiable information we may incur liability or suffer reputational damage in the marketplace as a result to the extent that any security breach impacts operations at our manufacturing sites we may experience production or shipping disruptions we maintain cyberinformation security insurance but any losses may be beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our policy 

information and operational security threats and methods of perpetrating fraud or misappropriating information are constantly evolving and becoming more complex which increases the difficulty and expense of defending against these threats although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including insurance monitoring of our systems and networks employee training crisis simulations and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information or operational technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

regulatory legal environmental and tax risks 

failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations andor changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws including antitrust and anticorruption laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs for example in december 2019 we announced the recording of a reserve in connection with a competition law investigation by the european commission based on certain past ethylene purchases by certain subsidiaries of the company and in july 2020 we announced that we had reached a final settlement of 92 million with respect to this investigation the company paid this settlement in full on january 12 2021 although we have implemented policies procedures and employee training designed to ensure compliance with these laws rules regulations and court decisions there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws rules regulations and court decisions which could result in fines penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation 

moreover changes in laws or regulations including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions in addition enforcement of environmental or other governmental policy may result in plant shut downs or significantly decreased production such as in china on high pollution days for example in 2021 we experienced energy curtailment mandates from the government in the chinese province where our nanjing production facility is located which forced us to reduce and curtail production at that site any of these types of conditions including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our products and raw materials see note 2 0  commitments and conting enc ie s in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our business exposes us to potential product liability warranty and tort claims and recalls which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette medical device pharmaceutical automobile construction and aerospace industries involves a risk of exposure to product liability warranty and tort claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability warranty or tort claim or judgment against us that is larger than those typically experienced in the regular course of business could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a significant partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger see note 1 3  environmental in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental health and safety matters and that regulate the handling manufacture use emission and disposal of products materials and hazardous and nonhazardous waste if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved we could also face claims for damages from individuals or groups for alleged violations of these laws or regulations 

we also incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with environmental health and safety requirements stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial additional costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for further information 

for more information on risks we face specifically related to climate change and related potential regulation see the risk factor titled we are subject to financial regulatory and physical risks associated with climate change as well as potential legislation regulation and international accords to address it below 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations independent studies or consumer or societal perceptions relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and polymers derived from formaldehyde may be classified and labeled in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example in 2019 the epa designated formaldehyde as a highpriority substance under the toxic substances control act and the substance is currently undergoing risk evaluation in addition in 2012 the international agency for research on cancer iarc a research agency within the world health organization classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on epidemiological studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans and leukemia in 2011 a similar conclusion was reached by the national toxicology program ntp a us interagency research program we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will continue to be examined and considered by government regulatory agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other initiatives including the chemical strategy for sustainability initiative currently to be undertaken by the eu as part of the green deal will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional regulatory requirements being placed on the production handling labeling andor use of the subject chemicals 

additionally increased social and regulatory focus on climate change could lead to changes in the demand behavior of our customers or their endcustomers and could result in reduced customer demand for products made from materials that are perceived to be significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change and we may not be able to fully address these concerns through changes in manufacturing methods or use of more sustainable materials and processes 

such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to financial regulatory and physical risks associated with climate change as well as potential legislation regulation and international accords to address it 

greenhouse gas ghg emissions have become the subject of significant international national regional state and local attention for example the epa has promulgated rules concerning reporting ghg emissions the european commission has also embarked on the european green deal initiative with the goal of making the eu carbon neutral by 2050 which is expected to lead to additional statutory and regulatory requirements in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation intended to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions 

a number of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing ghg emissions which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations some jurisdictions have emissions reduction measures directed at the power or oil and gas sectors which could result in higher power input costs for us other regulations that are being implemented or contemplated include the potential for restrictions on ghg emissions cap and trade emissions trading systems taxes on ghg emissions fuel and energy or carbon import charges on certain products among other provisions these measures if and where enacted may significantly increase our costs of operations or require us to incur significant additional capital costs for the installation of equipment to mitigate ghg emissions for our sites manufacturing operations 

physical impacts of climate change such as increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods and impact on sea levels may also impact our facilities and operations and those of our key suppliers a number of our sites are located in areas that are exposed to weather events and changing sea levels such as the texas gulf coast and that have been impacted by hurricanes and other weather events in the past as described elsewhere in these risk factors to the extent climate change exacerbates these threats our operations and supply chains could experience increased levels of disruptions 

we closely monitor developments in this area but there is significant uncertainty regarding what legislative or regulatory requirements may be put in place which makes it impossible for us to predict the longerterm impact these measures have on our operations however we believe that future legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are likely which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our aspirations goals and initiatives related to sustainability and our public statements and disclosures regarding them expose us to risks 

we have developed and publicized and expect to continue to establish goals targets and other objectives related to sustainability matters such statements reflect our current plans at the time they are made and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved our efforts to research establish accomplish and accurately report on these goals targets and objectives could expose us to operational reputational financial legal and other risks our ability to achieve any stated goal target or objective is and will be subject to numerous factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control such as evolving regulatory or quasiregulatory sustainability standards differing requirements and the pace of changes in technology 

we may face increased scrutiny from the investment community other stakeholders regulators and the media related to our sustainability activities including the goals targets and objectives that we announce and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them if our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our reputation ability to attract or retain employees and attractiveness as an investment business partner or as an acquiror could be negatively impacted similarly our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals targets and objectives to comply with ethical environmental or other standards regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters within the timelines that we announce or at all could have the same negative impacts as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation even if we achieve the goals targets and objectives we set we may not realize all of the benefits that it expected at the time they were established 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 1 3  environmental and note 2 0  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world or the resolution of tax examinations or audits could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates eu state aid rules in addition the organization of economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting initiatives which focus on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the us and many countries in the eu have changed or are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation the increasingly complex global tax environment and related legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was enacted and was effective january 1 2018 the us treasury has issued various final and proposed regulations supplementing the tcja provisions since 2018 see note 1 6  income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place 

our tax returns are under audit for the years 2013 through 2015 by the united states the netherlands and germany these authorities have proposed adjustments to transfer pricing and the reallocation of income between the related jurisdictions to open tax years through 2019 we are currently evaluating these proposals and all potential remedies if this matter is resolved in a manner inconsistent with our expectations or we are unsuccessful in defending our position our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of tax examinations or audits we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in future periods 

risks related to our human capital 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team the inability to recruit and retain talented employees or the unexpected loss of such talented employees or key personnel may adversely affect our operations in 2021 like many companies we experienced an increasingly competitive hiring environment for skilled employees at our manufacturing and other sites which in some cases has increased or may in the future increase the cost of retaining or hiring talented employees particularly in technical manufacturing roles critical to our success 

in addition we rely on our senior management team specifically therefore our future success depends in part on our ability to retain those members of senior management and to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the hiring and retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected 

longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned see note 1 2  benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2021 we had 8529 employees globally approximately 15 of our 3075 usbased employees are unionized in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

see note 1 1  debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 1 2  benefit obligations  note 1 3  environmental and note 2 0  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions including exacerbating the impact of any adverse business effects that are determined to be material adverse events under our existing senior credit agreement the credit agreement or our indentures the indentures governing our 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2022 €450 million in aggregate principal amount of 1125 senior unsecured notes due 2023 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3500 senior unsecured notes due 2024 €300 million in aggregate principal amount of 1250 senior unsecured notes due 2025 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 1400 senior unsecured notes due 2026 €500 million in aggregate principal amount of 2125 senior unsecured notes due 2027 and €500 million in aggregate principal amount of 0625 senior unsecured notes due 2028 collectively the senior notes 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness and amounts payable in connection with the satisfaction of our other liabilities therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our common stock par value 00001 per share common stock 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest 

• exposing us to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates as certain of our borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies and 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or pay dividends 

the credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the credit agreement and the indentures contain covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt incur liens securing debt merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the issuers assets or the assets of certain subsidiaries additionally the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the senior notes and the credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

covid19 update 

the covid19 pandemic and the various responses thereto including governmentimposed quarantines stayathome restrictions travel restrictions and other public health and safety measures continue to evolve our employees health and wellbeing continue to be of vital importance and we continue to monitor the pandemic in the areas where we have employees and operations we implemented government recommended protocols and best practices related to social distancing and hygiene we implemented careful returntooffice efforts in accordance with government regulations and recommended protocols 

after declining during 2020 consumer demand for most applications has increased and rebounded to precovid19 levels in many regions of the world which has positively impacted our results of operations where we temporarily reduced run rates in prior quarters our plants are now operating at more normalized levels although like many companies we have experienced a tightening labor market with increased competitiveness and higher costs for the pool of talent critical for specialty manufacturing and other operations 

due to potential impacts of covid19 resurgences and variants some uncertainty remains in the pandemics future duration and scope the extent to which resurgences or other variants of covid19 may adversely impact demand for our products availability and price of raw materials and the labor supply and therefore our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous factors including the effectiveness of vaccines the extent and locations of any resurgences of the virus health and safety measures and the continuing impact of the pandemic on supply chains including the availability and cost of transportation and materials on september 9 2021 the president directed the occupational safety and health administration to promulgate rules requiring large employers to mandate employee vaccinations these rules referred to as the emergency temporary standard ets were subject to a number of legal challenges including applications for emergency injunctions these actions were consolidated before the united states supreme court which issued a decision in january 2022 that stayed implementation of the ets in the united states the ets or similar regulations could be reapproved or reissued in a similar or different form and around the world we anticipate that national state and local governments will continue to pursue regulatory or legislative action designed to curb the spread of covid19 such efforts could impose additional costs on our operations these factors are uncertain rapidly changing and cannot be predicted 

the extent to which covid19 will adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors which are highly uncertain rapidly changing and cannot be predicted for further information regarding the impact covid19 could have on our business financial condition and results of operations see item 1a risk factors  for further discussion of our liquidity condition see liquidity and capital resources in this item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

risk factors 

item 1a risk factors of this annual report also contains a description of certain risk factors that you should consider which could significantly affect our financial results in addition the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements 

• changes in general economic business political and regulatory conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate 

• volatility or changes in the price and availability of raw materials and energy particularly changes in the demand for supply of and market prices of ethylene methanol natural gas wood pulp and fuel oil and the prices for electricity and other energy sources 

• the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the economic environment market demand and our operations as well as the pace of any economic recovery 

• the length and depth of product and industry business cycles particularly in the automotive electrical textiles electronics and construction industries 

• the ability to pass increases in raw material prices on to customers or otherwise improve margins through price increases

• the ability to obtain governmental approvals and to construct facilities on terms and schedules acceptable to us 

• changes in applicable tariffs duties and trade agreements tax rates or legislation throughout the world including but not limited to adjustments changes in estimates or interpretations or the resolution of tax examinations or audits that may impact recorded or future tax impacts and potential regulatory and legislative tax developments in other jurisdictions

• changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and 

• various other factors both referenced and not referenced in this annual report 

many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are therefore beyond our control covid19 and responses to the pandemic by governments and businesses have significantly increased financial and economic volatility and uncertainty exacerbating the risks and potential impact of these factors should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize affect us in ways or to an extent that we currently do not expect or consider to be significant or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this annual report as anticipated believed estimated expected intended planned or projected we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of their dates

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

net sales increased 29 billion or 51 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to

• higher volume in our engineered materials and acetyl chain segments primarily due to increased demand across most regions due to recovery from the covid19 pandemic and 

• a favorable currency impact resulting from a stronger euro relative to the us dollar 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 151 million or 31 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 we have 11 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations in addition we held cash and cash equivalents of 536 million as of december 31 2021 we are actively managing our business to maintain cash flow and we believe that liquidity from the abovereferenced sources will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future 

on december 1 2021 we acquired the santoprene™ thermoplastic vulcanizates tpv elastomers business of exxon mobil corporation santoprene for a purchase price of 115 billion in an allcash transaction see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service for the next twelve months if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

capital expenditures were 467 million for the year ended december 31 2021 we continue to prioritize those projects expected to drive productivity in the nearterm and expect capital expenditures to be approximately 600 million in 2022 primarily due to the following investments in growth opportunities and productivity improvements in engineered materials we announced plans to expand the compounding capacity at our facilities in china ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene uhmwpe production capacity in bishop texas and oberhausen germany to support the growing global electric vehicle battery market and an expansion of our florence kentucky technology and innovation center through the addition of a pharmaceutical drug delivery lab to support programs and products for longacting controlled release drug delivery in the acetyl chain we announced plans to expand the capacity of our vinyl acetate ethylene vae and emulsions plants in nanjing china and frankfurt germany expand the capacity of our vinyl acetate monomer vam plant in bay city texas expand the sustainable production of methanol at our fairway joint venture in clear lake texas using captured carbon dioxide as feedstock lastly our previously announced acetic acid expansion in clear lake texas is still in construction and on schedule we continue to see the incremental capacity from investments we made in recent years strengthen our manufacturing network reliability to best serve our customers 

we remain fully committed to our cash dividend during the year ended december 31 2021 we completed 10 billion of share repurchases 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock 

we are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate such as china india and indonesia capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies repatriate earnings or capital lend via intercompany loans or create crossborder cash pooling arrangements our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in china pursuant to applicable regulations foreigninvested enterprises in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations in addition the chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of china puts certain limitations on duration purpose and amount of intercompany loans and restricts crossborder cash pooling while it is possible that future tightening of these restrictions or application of new similar restrictions could impact us these limitations do not currently restrict our operations 

we remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations if our actual future results of operations differ materially from these expectations or if we otherwise experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower ebitda we may be required to seek an amendment or waiver of such covenants which may increase our borrowing costs under those debt instruments

business environment 

in the latter part of 2021 we experienced significant cost inflation inflationary pressure and supply disruptions related to the sourcing of raw materials energy logistics and labor we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 variants on demand conditions and the supply chain average prices of energy feedstocks particularly natural gas which are a significant input and source of energy for our manufacturing operations have continued to increase in the western hemisphere and particularly in europe we also experienced and continue to experience cost pressure on raw material inputs we undertook pricing actions throughout the year intended to offset these inflationary headwinds moderation of chinese acetyls pricing is expected to continue trending to more normalized levels into the middle of 2022 while we took proactive actions to accelerate turnaround and maintenance activity to earlier in the year which supported our ability to increase volume and meet the demand by our customers the sourcing constraints we experienced led to lost production we expect that sourcing cost and inflationary pressures will continue to be significant across the business through 2022 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

• recoverability of longlived assets 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of multiple factors including the current operating environment financial performance and market considerations we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units or other indefinitelived intangible assets and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis of goodwill recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 

specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

see note 9  goodwill and intangible assets net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

• benefit obligations 

various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

see note 1 2  benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

• income taxes 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties

• foreign currency forwards and swaps 

a portion of our assets liabilities net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results our largest exposures are to the euro and chinese yuan cny a decline in the value of the euro and cny versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros and cnys likewise an increase in the value of the euro and cny versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that a 10 change in the eurous dollar and cnyus dollar exchange rates would impact our earnings by 84 million and 38 million respectively

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to economic and industry conditions 

our business financial condition and result of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly and adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and we cannot predict the extent to which this effect will continue 

in december 2019 a novel coronavirus causing a disease known as covid19 was first reported in china and its spread was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 substantially all locations where we and our customers and suppliers have offices and production facilities were impacted by governmentimposed quarantines stayathome restrictions travel restrictions and other public health and safety measures 

covid19 has significantly impacted our operations and financial results during 2020 by slowing down the economy and depressing demand in many of our markets and causing a negative impact on many of our customers as well as the end customers of products for which our products serve as materials and inputs 

the extent to which covid19 will continue to impact our operations or those of our customers or suppliers will depend on future developments and numerous factors which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence these include 

• the extent of any resurgence in infections and the spread of the disease and the effectiveness of any vaccines 

• additional governmental business and individual actions to contain the spread of the outbreak including social distancing workathome stayathome and shelterinplace orders and shutdowns travel restrictions and quarantines 

• the extent to which these conditions depress economic activity generally and demand for our products specifically and affect the financial markets 

• the effect of the outbreak on our employees customers suppliers supply chain and other business partners 

• our ability during the outbreak to provide our products and services 

• disruptions to our business supply chain or the availability of raw materials caused by plant workplace and office closures 

• the risk that we could be exposed to liability negative publicity or reputational harm related to any incidents of actual or perceived transmission of covid19 among employees at our facilities 

• the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services during and following the outbreak 

• our ability to access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms and 

• our ability to comply with the financial covenant in our credit agreement if a material and prolonged economic downturn were to result in increased indebtedness or substantially lower ebitda 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and it is unknown how long disruptions to our customers demand will continue we have monitored and will continue to monitor the situation closely 

we are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the united states us germany china japan south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions for example any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements or the imposition of new or increased tariffs on our products or raw materials or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china may increase costs or reduce profitability or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy in addition it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements collect receivables receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss furthermore in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow or trade flows could be negatively impacted and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales annually and accounted for approximately 40 of our net sales in 2020 adverse conditions in the european economy related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu membership or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth trade disruptions decreased enduse customer demand or other factors 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in our intermediate chemistry business principally acetic acid vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our emulsion polymers and eva polymer businesses primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of acetate tow the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adversely impacted financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

• shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand eg from growing uses or new uses 

• capacity constraints eg due to construction delays labor disruption governmentimposed work or travel restrictions involuntary shutdowns or turnarounds 

• a suppliers inability to meet our delivery orders a suppliers decision not to fulfill orders or to terminate a supply contract or our inability to obtain or renew supply contracts on favorable terms 

• the general level of business economic and industry activity and 

• the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation including the impact of government regulation relating to climate change or regulation of production and transport of certain chemicals 

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect 

on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or site services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible that profitability would be adversely affected if we were required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

almost all of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway with mitsui in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas 

risks related to our global operations and our strategy 

production at our manufacturing facilities or at our suppliers could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems public health crises including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

we have experienced recent disruptions of the type described above in august 2020 to protect our employees and safeguard the assets at our clear lake facility we temporarily voluntarily ceased production at our clear lake texas facility during the landfall of hurricane laura during 2019 production of acetic acid and vam was disrupted due to a localized fire at our clear lake texas facility which caused reduced sales and profits 

disruptions or interruptions of production or operations could also occur due to accidents interruptions in sources of raw materials cyber security incidents terrorism or political unrest or other unforeseen events or delays in construction or operation of facilities including as a result of geopolitical conditions the occurrence of acts of war or terrorist incidents or as a result of weather natural disasters or other crises including public health crises 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our engineered materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with applicable quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of and minimize the disruption to our operations and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances in addition we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also monitor intellectual property of others especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development our rights to manufacture and market our products and our rights to use knowhow and trade secrets we will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us 

seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges we also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights or protecting our rights to commercially make market and sell our products our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors furthermore some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or joint venture transactions or successfully integrate them into our business which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates the ability to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to complete a planned transaction and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions and joint venture transactions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations see strategic affiliates in item 1 business for further information 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and cyberinformation security insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced and persistent threats in the areas of information technology security and fraud we seek to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and to detect and investigate any security incidents that may occur however in some cases we might be unaware of a particular incident or its magnitude and effects at the current time we may face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during the covid19 pandemic which may create additional information security vulnerabilities andor magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems additionally we may be exposed to unauthorized access to our information technology systems through undetected vulnerabilities in our service providers information systems or software 

the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential or personally identifiable information we may incur liability or suffer reputational damage in the marketplace as a result we maintain cyberinformation security insurance but any losses may be beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our policy 

information security threats and methods of perpetrating fraud or misappropriating information are constantly evolving and becoming more complex which increases the difficulty and expense of defending against these threats although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including insurance monitoring of our systems and networks employee training and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

legal regulatory and tax risks 

failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations andor changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws including antitrust and anticorruption laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs for example in december 2019 we announced the recording of a reserve in connection with a competition law investigation by the european commission based on certain past ethylene purchases by certain subsidiaries of the company and in july 2020 we announced that we had reached a final settlement of 92 million with respect to this investigation the 

company paid this settlement in full on january 12 2021 although we have implemented policies procedures and employee training designed to ensure compliance with these laws rules regulations and court decisions there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws rules regulations and court decisions which could result in fines penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation 

moreover changes in laws or regulations including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions in addition enforcement of environmental or other governmental policy may result in plant shut downs or significantly decreased production such as in china on high pollution days any of these conditions including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our products and raw materials see note 21  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our business exposes us to potential product liability warranty and tort claims and recalls which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette medical device pharmaceutical automobile construction and aerospace industries involves a risk of exposure to product liability warranty and tort claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability warranty or tort claim or judgment against us that is larger than those typically experienced in the regular course of business could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a significant partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger see note 14  environmental in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental health and safety matters and that regulate the handling manufacture use emission and disposal of products materials and hazardous and nonhazardous waste if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved we could also face claims for damages from individuals or groups for alleged violations of these laws or regulations 

we also incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with environmental health and safety requirements stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial additional costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations independent studies or consumer or societal perceptions relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and polymers derived from formaldehyde may be classified and labeled in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example in 2012 the international agency for research on cancer iarc a research agency within the world health organization classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on epidemiological studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans and leukemia in 2011 a similar conclusion was reached by the national toxicology program ntp a us interagency research program we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will continue to be examined and considered by government regulatory agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other initiatives including the eu green deal strategy on the sustainable use of chemicals potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act which amended the toxic substances control act tsca the united states primary chemicals management law as well as the uss proposal to update reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional regulatory requirements being placed on the production handling labeling andor use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed into law may increase our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program which is administered by the department of homeland security identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 was enacted and reauthorized on july 22 2020 for three years the reauthorization does not make any changes to the program 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency has promulgated rules concerning reporting greenhouse gas emissions the european commission has also embarked on the european green deal initiative with the goal of making the eu carbon neutral by 2050 which could lead to additional statutory or regulatory requirements in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation as such future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are likely which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 14  environmental and note 21  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates eu state aid rules in addition the organization of economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting initiatives which focus on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the us and many countries in the eu have changed or are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment and related legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was enacted and was effective january 1 2018 the us treasury has issued various final and proposed regulations supplementing the tcja provisions since 2018 see note 17  income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in future periods 

risks related to our human capital 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

we rely heavily on our management team accordingly our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned see note 13  benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2020 we had 7658 employees globally approximately 16 of our 2678 usbased employees are unionized in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

see note 12  debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 11  noncurrent other liabilities  note 13  benefit obligations  note 14  environmental and note 21  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions including exacerbating the impact of any adverse business effects that are determined to be material adverse events under our existing senior credit agreement the credit agreement or our indentures the indentures governing our 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior unsecured notes due 2021 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2022 €750 million in aggregate principal amount of 1125 senior unsecured notes due 2023 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3500 senior unsecured notes due 2024 €300 million in aggregate principal amount of 1250 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and €500 million in aggregate principal amount of 2125 senior unsecured notes due 2027 collectively the senior notes 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness and amounts payable in connection with the satisfaction of our other liabilities therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our common stock par value 00001 per share common stock 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest 

• exposing us to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates as certain of our borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies and 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or pay dividends 

the credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the credit agreement and the indentures contain covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt incur liens securing debt merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the issuers assets or the assets of certain subsidiaries additionally the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the senior notes and the credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

covid19 update 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic which originated in china and has spread throughout the world to substantially all locations where we have offices production facilities customers and suppliers creating a dynamic and challenging situation worldwide the covid19 pandemic is evolving and to date has led to the implementation of various responses including governmentimposed quarantines stayathome restrictions travel restrictions and other public health and safety measures 

our employees health and wellbeing continue to be of vital importance for employees who are working in plants and who have returned to the office we have implemented government recommended protocols and best practices related to social distancing and best hygiene practices including the use of additional personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning protocols where appropriate we have also restricted visitor access and nonessential business travel we have a global crisis team in place monitoring the evolving situation and recommending risk mitigation actions including workplace health and safety measures we also have site activation teams at all locations to guide and implement our careful returntooffice efforts in accordance with government regulations and recommended protocols our presence in china provided us with an advance view of how covid19 scenarios can unfold as well as the importance of taking early action 

we operate within a geographicallybalanced global footprint and have the ability to utilize different production and distribution strategies depending on the business and product to satisfy customer demands we continue to pursue our existing operational strategy where we temporarily reduced run rates in prior quarters our plants are now operating at more normalized levels and we have been able to maintain a largely consistent supply chain during the first half of 2020 the effects of covid19 and related actions to control its spread had a significant negative impact on the operating results of our engineered materials and acetyl chain segments however during the second half of 2020 consumer demand for most applications increased within many regions of the world particularly in china and the us which have rebounded to precovid19 levels in engineered materials demand has returned to precovid19 levels for automotive and consumer goods such as electronics and appliances applications including food and beverage pharma and 5g infrastructure continue to be resilient demand for medical applications remains at slightly reduced levels as a result of delayed elective surgeries in the acetyl chain we benefit from a highly diversified set of enduses with less exposure relative to others in the industry to end markets that have been most acutely impacted by covid19 however the low acetic acid pricing along with volatility with global oil markets presented a deflationary environment for the acetyl chain business for the year ended december 31 2020 that trend began to reverse toward the end of 2020 as recent increases in raw material prices and demand levels had a beneficial impact on pricing 

within the acetyl chain further we see resiliency and even growth in some applications within all of our segments including packaging hygiene products disinfectants pharma paints bonding agents and cigarettes we currently anticipate that customer demand and our results of operations should continue on a more normalized basis in 2021 assuming effective rollout of vaccines and absent a resurgence of covid19 as the economies in which we operate continue to recover 

we have taken and will continue to take actions as necessary to mitigate the impact of covid19 on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow we managed inventory levels reduced our manufacturing costs and optimized our working capital we have reduced discretionary spending such as travel and other corporate functional expenses although significant layoffs have not occurred within the company during the year ended december 31 2020 a small number of positions have been eliminated under a global restructuring program implemented largely as a result of cost cutting initiatives as part of our ongoing commitment to driving efficiencies and on which decisions were made before and independently from the onset of the pandemic 

we are actively managing our business to maintain cash flow and we believe that liquidity from i cash generated from operations ii cash on hand iii dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments and iv cash available from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future we remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations 

capital expenditures were 364 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and are expected to be in the range of 450 million to 500 million in 2021 prioritizing those projects that continue to drive productivity in the nearterm we remain fully committed to our current cash dividend during the year ended december 31 2020 we completed 650 million of share repurchases and expect to purchase approximately 400 million to 500 million of additional shares in 2021 

the extent to which covid19 will adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors which are highly uncertain rapidly changing and cannot be predicted for further information regarding the impact covid19 could have on our business financial condition and results of operations see item 1a risk factors  for further discussion of our liquidity condition see liquidity and capital resources in this item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 we have 13 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations in addition we held cash and cash equivalents of 955 million as of december 31 2020 we are actively managing our business to maintain cash flow and we believe that liquidity from the abovereferenced sources will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service for the next twelve months if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 450 million to 500 million in 2021 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities and productivity improvements primarily in our engineered materials and acetyl chain segments 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock 

we are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate such as china india and indonesia capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies repatriate earnings or capital lend via intercompany loans or create crossborder cash pooling arrangements our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in china pursuant to applicable regulations foreigninvested enterprises in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations in addition the chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of china puts certain limitations on duration purpose and amount of intercompany loans and restricts crossborder cash pooling while it is possible that future tightening of these restrictions or application of new similar restrictions could impact us these limitations do not currently restrict our operations 

we remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations if our actual future results of operations differ materially from these expectations or if we otherwise experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower ebitda we may be required to seek an amendment or waiver of such covenants which may increase our borrowing costs under those debt instruments 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 492 million to 955 million as of december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 578 million of the 955 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries under the tcja we have incurred a prior year charge associated with the deemed repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings including foreign held cash these funds are largely accessible without additional material tax consequences if needed in the us to fund operations see note 17  income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

• net cash provided by used in operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 111 million to 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 15 billion for the same period in 2019 net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased primarily due to 

• a decrease in net earnings net of the sale of our polyplastics joint venture equity interest 

partially offset by

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

• recoverability of longlived assets 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of multiple factors including the current operating environment financial performance and market considerations we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units or other indefinitelived intangible assets and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis of goodwill recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 

specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

see note 9  goodwill and intangible assets net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

• benefit obligations 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

see note 13  benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

• income taxes 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china the united kingdom mexico canada and france we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties

• foreign currency forwards and swaps 

a portion of our assets liabilities net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results our largest exposures are to the euro and chinese yuan cny a decline in the value of the euro and cny versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros and cnys likewise an increase in the value of the euro and cny versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that a 10 change in the eurous dollar and cnyus dollar exchange rates would impact our earnings by 52 million and 19 million respectively

 our acetate tow business is a leading global producer and supplier of acetate tow and acetate flake primarily used in filter products applications we hold an approximately 30 ownership interest in three separate ventures in china that produce acetate flake and acetate tow china national tobacco corporation a chinese stateowned tobacco entity has been our venture partner for over three decades our acetate tow business has production sites in belgium and the us along with sites at our three acetate tow strategic affiliates in china 

on june 28 2019 we announced the consolidation of our global acetate manufacturing operations with the closure of our acetate flake manufacturing operations at the ocotlán mexico facility the closure is intended to strengthen our competitive position and align future production capacities with anticipated industry demand trends see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 acetate tow and acetate flake  acetate tow is a fiber used primarily in cigarette filters in order to produce acetate tow we first produce acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic acid and acetic anhydride wood pulp generally comes from reforested trees and is purchased externally from a variety of sources and acetic anhydride is an intermediate chemical that we produce from acetic acid in our intermediate chemistry business acetate flake is then further processed into acetate tow 

sales of acetate tow amounted to 9  8 and 10 of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

 acetate tow is sold principally to the major tobacco companies that account for a majority of worldwide cigarette production 

the pricing of products within the acetate tow segment is sensitive to demand and is primarily based on the valueinuse many sales are conducted under contracts with pricing for one or more years as a result margins may expand or contract in response to changes in raw material costs over these similar periods and we may be unable to adjust pricing due to other factors such as the intense level of competition in the industry

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the united states us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions for example any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements or the imposition of new or increased tariffs on our products or raw materials or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china may increase costs or reduce profitability or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy in addition it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements collect receivables receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss furthermore in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales for example in 2019  sales originating in europe accounted for approximately 40 of our net sales adverse conditions in the european economy related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu membership or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth decreased enduse customer demand or other factors 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in our intermediate chemistry business principally acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our emulsion polymers and eva polymer businesses primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of acetate tow the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or site services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

almost all of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway methanol llc fairway with mitsui  co ltd of tokyo japan in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas 

production at our manufacturing facilities or at our suppliers could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption during 2019 production of acetic acid and vam was disrupted due to a localized fire at our clear lake texas facility which caused reduced sales and profits 

disruptions or interruptions of production or operations could also occur due to accidents interruptions in sources of raw materials cyber security incidents terrorism or political unrest public health crises including but not limited to the coronavirus outbreak or other unforeseen events or delays in construction or operation of facilities including as a result of 

geopolitical conditions the occurrence of acts of war or terrorist incidents or as a result of weather natural disasters or other crises including public health crises 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our engineered materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability warranty and tort claims and recalls which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile construction aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involves a risk of exposure to product liability warranty and tort claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability warranty or tort claim or judgment against us that is larger than those typically experienced in the regular course of business could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a significant partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with applicable quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also monitor intellectual property of others especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development our rights to manufacture and market our products and our rights to use knowhow and trade secrets we will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names 

become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges we also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights or protecting our rights to commercially make market and sell our products our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors furthermore some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations andor changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws including antitrust and anticorruption laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws rules regulations and court decisions there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws rules regulations and court decisions which could result in fines penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation 

moreover changes in laws or regulations including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions in addition enforcement of environmental or other governmental policy may result in plant shut downs or significantly decreased production such as in china on high pollution days any of these conditions including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our products and raw materials see note 24  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde may be classified and labeled in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example in 2012 the international agency for research on cancer iarc a research agency within the world health organization classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on epidemiological studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans and leukemia in 2011 a similar conclusion was reached by the national toxicology program ntp a us interagency research program we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will continue to be examined and considered by government regulatory agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act which amended the toxic substances control act tsca the united states primary chemicals management law as well as various european commission regulatory programs such as reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional regulatory requirements being placed on the production handling labeling andor use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of and minimize the disruption to our operations and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances in addition we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed into law may increase our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program cfats program which is administered by the department of homeland security dhs identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 cfats act was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years the cfats extension act of 2019 hr 251 was signed into law by the president on january 19 2019 hr 251 extends cfats for 15 months until april 19 2020 this extension does not make any changes to the program and is intended to provide lawmakers the needed time to discuss improvements to cfats and provides for a longer term authorization dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of our nations chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions and cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation as such future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 16  environmental and note 24  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates eu state aid rules in addition the organization of economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the us and many countries in the eu have changed or are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

on december 31 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was enacted and was effective january 1 2018 this overhaul of the us tax law made a number of substantial changes including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the us elimination or limitation of certain deductions interest domestic production activities and executive compensation imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 and establishing global minimum income tax and base erosion tax provisions related to offshore activities and affiliated party payments the us treasury issued several proposed and final regulations supplementing the tcja in 2018 and 2019 the final foreign tax credit regulations and base erosion tax regulations issued in 2019 did not have a material impact to our 2019 tax rate and we do not expect a material impact upon final adoption of the interest expense limitation regulations or the additional proposed foreign tax credit regulations if adopted in current form see note 19  income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

we rely heavily on our management team accordingly our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been 

implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2019  we had 7714 employees globally approximately 16 of our 2764 usbased employees are unionized in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or joint venture transactions or successfully integrate them into our business which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates the ability to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to consummate a planned transaction and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions and joint venture transactions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

see note 14  debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 13  noncurrent other liabilities  note 15  benefit obligations  note 16  environmental and note 24  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase the risks described above 

although covenants under the credit agreement and the indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results 

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk respectively see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below and note 22  derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain 

financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or pay dividends 

the credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the credit agreement contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the issuers assets or the assets of its subsidiaries 

in addition the indentures limit celanese us holdings llc celanese us and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell certain assets prepay or modify certain indebtedness and engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the senior notes and the credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2019 we have 978 million available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and 5 million available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service for the next twelve months if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 500 million in 2020 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our engineered materials and acetyl chain segments 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock par value 00001 per share common stock 

we are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate such as china india and indonesia capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies repatriate earnings or capital lend via intercompany loans or create crossborder cash pooling arrangements our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in china pursuant to applicable regulations foreigninvested enterprises in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations in addition the chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of china puts certain limitations on duration purpose and amount of intercompany loans and restricts crossborder cash pooling 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 24 million to 463 million as of december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018  as of december 31 2019  391 million of the 463 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries under the tcja we have incurred a prior year charge associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings including foreign held cash these funds are largely accessible if needed in the us to fund operations see note 19  income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

debt and other obligations 

 on january 7 2019 celanese celanese us and certain subsidiary borrowers entered into a new senior credit agreement the credit agreement consisting of a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a letter of credit sublimit maturing in 2024 the credit agreement is guaranteed by celanese celanese us and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors we borrowed 13 billion and repaid 11 billion under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2019  

 we have outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in public offerings registered under the securities act of 1933 securities act as amended as follows collectively the senior notes 

the senior notes were issued by celanese us and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by celanese and the subsidiary guarantors celanese us may redeem some or all of each of the senior notes prior to their respective maturity dates at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus a makewhole premium as specified in the applicable indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the redemption date 

on may 8 2019 celanese us completed an offering of the 3500 notes in a public offering registered under the securities act the 3500 notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99895  net proceeds from the sale of the 3500 notes were used to redeem in full the 3250 notes to repay 156 million of outstanding borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes in connection with the issuance of the 3500 notes we entered into a crosscurrency swap to effectively convert our fixedrate us dollar denominated debt under the 3500 notes including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate euro denominated debt 

in november 2018 celanese us completed an offering of the 2125 notes in a public offering registered under the securities act the 2125 notes were issued under a base indenture dated may 6 2011 the 2125 notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99231  net proceeds from the sale of the 2125 notes were used to repay 463 million of our senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes 

 in june 2018 we entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis these transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer we have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables other than collection and administrative responsibilities and once sold the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy we derecognized 257 million and 117 million of accounts receivable under this factoring agreement as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

our us accounts receivable securitization facility was amended on july 8 2019 to extend the maturity date to july 6 2020 we borrowed 112 million and repaid 74 million under this facility during the year ended december 31 2019  

our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios events of default and change of control provisions failure to comply with these covenants or the occurrence of any other event of default could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations we are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of december 31 2019

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our reporting units include our engineered materials acetate tow food ingredients emulsion polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of multiple factors including the current operating environment financial performance and market considerations after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment we may engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist with this process the valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis and the discounted cash flow approach discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

see note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world accordingly our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use handling processing storage and transportation of hazardous materials we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated depending on the nature of the site we accrue through 15 years  unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond 15 years  we estimate environmental liabilities on a casebycase basis using the most current status of available facts existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 

an environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include for example a provision for one or more of the following types of costs site investigation and testing costs cleanup costs costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and postremediation monitoring costs these undiscounted liabilities do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort we utilize third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for our sites changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur 

see note 16  environmental in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

see note 15  benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 when determinable we accrue contingent losses for matters that are probable of occurring for which a loss amount can be reasonably estimated for certain potentially material loss contingency matters we are sometimes unable to estimate and accrue a loss deemed probable of occurring for such matters we disclose an estimate of the possible loss range of loss or a statement that such estimate cannot be made 

because our evaluation and assessment of critical facts and circumstances surrounding a contingent loss matter is in advance of the matters final determination there is an inherent subjectivity and unpredictability involved in estimating accounting for and reporting contingent losses generally the less progress made in the resolution of a contingent loss matter or the broader the range of potential outcomes the more difficult it is for us to estimate accrue and report a loss for example we may disclose certain information about a plaintiffs legal claim against us that is alleged in the plaintiffs pleadings or otherwise publicly available while information of this type may provide more insight into the potential magnitude of a matter it might not necessarily be indicative of our estimate of probable or possible loss in addition some of our contingent loss exposures may be eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of our insurance coverage we do not consider the potential availability of insurance coverage in determining our probable or possible loss estimates as a result of these factors among others our ultimate contingent loss exposure may be higher or lower and possibly materially so than our recorded probable loss accruals and disclosures of possible losses 

see note 24  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china the united kingdom mexico canada and france  we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the united states us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions for example any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements or the imposition of new or increased tariffs on our products or raw materials or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china may increase costs or reduce profitability or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy in addition it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements collect receivables receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss furthermore in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales for example in 2018  sales originating in europe accounted for approximately 40 of our net sales adverse conditions in the european economy related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu membership or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting in decreased enduse customer demand 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in our intermediate chemistry business principally acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our emulsion polymers and eva polymer businesses primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of acetate tow the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

 15 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or site services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

almost all of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway methanol llc fairway with mitsui  co ltd of tokyo japan in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas 

production at our manufacturing facilities or at our suppliers could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our engineered 

 16 

materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile construction aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involves a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with applicable quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also monitor intellectual property of others especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development our rights to manufacture and market our products and our rights to use knowhow and trade secrets we will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges we also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights or protecting our rights to commercially make market and sell our products our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 17 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors furthermore some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations andor changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws including antitrust and anticorruption laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws rules regulations and court decisions there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws rules regulations and court decisions which could result in fines penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation 

moreover changes in laws or regulations including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions in addition enforcement of environmental or other governmental policy may result in plant shut downs or significantly decreased production such as in china on high pollution days any of these conditions including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our products and raw materials 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources   for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde may be classified and labeled in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example in 2012 the international agency for research on cancer iarc a research agency within the world health organization classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on epidemiological studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans and leukemia in 

 18 

2011 a similar conclusion was reached by the national toxicology program ntp a us interagency research program we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will continue to be examined and considered by government regulatory agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act which amended the toxic substances control act tsca the united states primary chemicals management law as well as various european commission regulatory programs such as reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional regulatory requirements being placed on the production handling labeling andor use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of and minimize the disruption to our operations and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances in addition we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program cfats program which is administered by the department of homeland security dhs identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 cfats act was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years the cfats extension act of 2019 hr 251 was signed into law by the president on january 19 2019 hr 251 extends cfats for 15 months until april 19 2020 this extension does not make any changes to the program and is intended to provide lawmakers the needed time to discuss improvements to cfats and provides for a longer term authorization dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of our nations chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions and cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation as such future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 19 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 16  environmental  and note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates eu state aid rules in addition the organization of economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the us and many countries in the eu have changed or are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

on december 31 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was enacted and was effective january 1 2018 in accordance with accounting standards codification 740 accounting for income taxes  which requires companies to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment this overhaul of the us tax law made a number of substantial changes including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the us elimination or limitation of certain deductions interest domestic production activities and executive compensation imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 and establishing global minimum income tax and base erosion tax provisions related to offshore activities and affiliated party payments due to the timing and significance of the tcja the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new us tax law 

the us treasury issued several proposed regulations supplementing the tcja in 2018 these proposed regulations are intended to be applicable retroactively and would not materially impact our 2018 tax rate if finalized in current form we currently do not expect them to have a material impact on income tax expense upon final adoption see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or 

 20 

decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

we rely heavily on our management team accordingly our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

 21 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2018  we had 7684  employees globally approximately 16  of our 2693  usbased employees are unionized in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock par value 00001 per share common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or joint venture transactions or successfully integrate them into our business which could adversely affect our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates the ability to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to consummate a planned transaction and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions and joint venture transactions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

 22 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

see note 14  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 13  noncurrent other liabilities  note 15  benefit obligations  and note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the credit agreement and the indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk respectively see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

 23 

results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness or pay dividends 

the credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the credit agreement contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the issuers assets or the assets of its subsidiaries 

in addition the indentures limit celanese us holdings llc celanese us and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell certain assets prepay or modify certain indebtedness and engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the senior notes and the credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make 

 24 

payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

item 1a risk factors   of this annual report also contains a description of certain risk factors that you should consider which could significantly affect our financial results in addition the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements these factors include among other things 



 32 

 many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are therefore beyond our control should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this annual report as anticipated believed estimated expected intended planned or projected we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of their dates 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update 201707 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  which clarifies the presentation and classification of the components of net periodic benefit costs in the consolidated statements of operations see note 3  recent accounting pronouncements  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

also during the year ended december 31 2018 we reorganized our operating and reportable segments to align with recent structural and management reporting changes these changes reflect 1 the movement of our food ingredients business from the consumer specialties reportable segment into our engineered materials reportable segment 2 the renaming of the former consumer specialties reportable segment as the acetate tow segment 3 the renaming of the former advanced engineered materials reportable segment as the engineered materials segment and 4 the combination of the former industrial specialties and former acetyl intermediates operating and reportable segments into the acetyl chain operating and reportable segment see note 26  segment information  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

nonoperating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expense increased 106 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the same period in 2017  primarily due to 

 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018  was 19  compared to 20  for the year ended 2017  the effective tax rate for 2018 was slightly less than the statutory us tax rate primarily due to the positive impact from our jurisdictional mix of earnings largely offset by increased valuation allowances established on certain deferred tax assets particularly related to increases in provisionally recorded estimates of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits in the us and net operating loss carryforwards in luxembourg due to certain restructuring transactions completed to facilitate future repatriation of cash to the us 

on december 31 2017 the tcja was enacted and was effective january 1 2018 due to the timing and significance of the tcja the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new us tax law 

in 2017 we previously recorded provisional amounts for several of the impacts of the new tax law including the deemed repatriation tax on post1986 accumulated earnings and profits the deferred tax rate change effect of the new law gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances to offset foreign tax credit carryforwards as of december 31 2018 we have completed our accounting for the tcja including the proposed 2018 clarifying guidance see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017  was 20  compared to 12  for the year ended 2016  the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 we recognized net tax expense of 197 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 this expense of 197 million was partially offset by a 107 million reduction of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of lowering the us tax rate from 35 to 21 and other technical provisions in the tcja we also recognized a net tax benefit of 76 million related to foreign tax credits generated as a result of various reorganization transactions to separate certain acetate tow assets to reorganize the holdings of its various foreign subsidiaries no material cash impact is expected from the deemed repatriation due to existing foreign tax credit carryforwards the 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted primarily due to settlement of uncertain tax positions and technical clarifications in germany and the us of 55 million  see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2018  we have 960 million available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and 14 million  available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service for the next twelve months if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 350 million to 400 million in 2019 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our engineered materials and acetyl chain segments 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock par value 00001 per share common stock 

we are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate such as china india and indonesia capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies repatriate earnings or capital lend via intercompany loans or create crossborder cash pooling arrangements our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in china pursuant to applicable regulations foreigninvested enterprises in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations in addition the chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of china puts certain limitations on duration purpose and amount of intercompany loans and restricts crossborder cash pooling 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents decreased   137 million to 439 million  as of december 31 2018  compared to december 31 2017    as of december 31 2018  368 million  of the 439 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries   under the tcja we have incurred a charge associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings including foreign held cash these funds are largely accessible if needed in the us to fund operations see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 year ended december 31 2018  compared to year ended december 31 2017

debt and other obligations 

 in july 2016 celanese celanese us and certain subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement credit agreement consisting of a 500 million  senior unsecured term loan and a 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a letter of credit sublimit each maturing in 2021 the margin for borrowings under the senior unsecured term loan and the senior unsecured revolving credit facility was 15  above libor at our current credit ratings the credit agreement is guaranteed by celanese celanese us and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors the proceeds from the new senior unsecured term loan and 409 million  of borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay our term c2 and c3 loans under our previous senior secured credit facilities we borrowed 940 million  and repaid 997 million  under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2018  see note 30  subsequent events  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we have outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in public offerings registered under the securities act of 1933 securities act as amended as follows collectively the senior notes 

 47 

the senior notes were issued by celanese us and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by celanese and the subsidiary guarantors celanese us may redeem some or all of each of the senior notes prior to their respective maturity dates at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus a makewhole premium as specified in the applicable indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the redemption date 

on november 5 2018 celanese us completed an offering of the 2125  notes in a public offering registered under the securities act the 2125  notes were issued under a base indenture dated may 6 2011 the 2125  notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99231  net proceeds from the sale of the 2125  notes were used to repay 463 million  of our senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes 

in december 2017 celanese us completed an offering of the 1250  notes in a public offering registered under the securities act the 1250  notes were issued under a base indenture dated may 6 2011 the 1250  notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99810  net proceeds from the sale of the 1250  notes were used to make a discretionary contribution into our us pension plans of 316 million and for general corporate purposes 

in september 2016 celanese us completed an offering of the 1125 notes in a public offering registered under the securities act the 1125 notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99713  net proceeds from the sale of the 1125 notes were used to repay 411 million of outstanding borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

 during the year ended december 31 2018 we entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis these transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer we have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables other than collection and administrative responsibilities and once sold the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy we derecognized 117 million of accounts receivable during the year ended december 31 2018 

in july 2016 certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amendment of our accounts receivable securitization facility extending its maturity to july 2019 and decreasing the available amount to 120 million we borrowed 25 million  and repaid 28 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  

our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios events of default and change of control provisions failure to comply with these covenants or the occurrence of any other event of default could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations we are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of december 31 2018

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our reporting units include our engineered materials acetate tow food ingredients emulsion polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment we may engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist with this process the valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis and the discounted cash flow approach discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant 

 50 

management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

see note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world accordingly our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use handling processing storage and transportation of hazardous materials we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated depending on the nature of the site we accrue through 15 years  unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond 15 years  we estimate environmental liabilities on a casebycase basis using the most current status of available facts existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 

an environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include for example a provision for one or more of the following types of costs site investigation and testing costs cleanup costs costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and postremediation monitoring costs these undiscounted reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort we utilize third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for our sites changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur 

see note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

beginning in 2016 we elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans previously we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs 

 51 

this change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial gain loss reported we accounted for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016 

see note 15  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

the estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2019  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications prior settlements demands which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings 

see note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china the united kingdom canada and france  we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

 52 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties

cellulose derivatives strategic ventures our cellulose derivatives ventures within our consumer specialties segment generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on each ventures performance in the preceding year in 2017  2016  and 2015  we received cash dividends of 107 million  107 million  and 106 million  respectively 

although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20 we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap

backlog 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of net sales or financial performance

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the united states us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions for example any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy in addition it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements collect receivables receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss furthermore in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales for example in 2017  sales originating in europe accounted for approximately 40 of our net sales adverse conditions in the european economy related to the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu membership or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting in decreased enduse customer demand 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose derivatives in our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol 

 18 

carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

a portion of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway methanol llc fairway with mitsui  co ltd of tokyo japan in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas 

production at our manufacturing facilities or at our suppliers could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our advanced engineered materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability 

 19 

to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile construction aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involves a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also monitor intellectual property of others especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development our rights to manufacture and market our products and our rights to use knowhow and trade secrets we will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges we also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights or protecting our rights to commercially make market and sell our products our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 20 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors furthermore some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations andor changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws including antitrust and anticorruption laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws rules regulations and court decisions there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws rules regulations and court decisions which could result in fines penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation 

moreover changes in laws or regulations including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources   for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde may be classified in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example the international agency for research on cancer iarc a private research agency classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in addition several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia in october 2009 iarc concluded that there is sufficient 

 21 

evidence of a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia in 2011 the national toxicology program ntp released the 12th report on carcinogens which changed the classification of formaldehyde from reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen to known to be a human carcinogen similar to the iarc modification in 2009 the ntp report also implicates formaldehyde as a leukemogen we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act in the us as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of and minimize the disruption to our operations and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances in addition we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program cfats program which is administered by the department of homeland security dhs identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 cfats act was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of our nations chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions and cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation as such future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 22 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 16  environmental  and note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates eu state aid rules in addition the organization of economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the us and many countries in the eu are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was enacted and is effective january 1 2018 accounting standards codification 740 accounting for income taxes  requires companies to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment this overhaul of the us tax law made a number of substantial changes including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the us elimination or limitation of certain deductions interest domestic production activities and executive compensation imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 and establishing global minimum income tax and base erosion tax provisions related to offshore activities and affiliated party payments due to the timing of the new tax law and the substantial changes it brings the staff of the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 which provides registrants a measurement period to report the impact of the new us tax law as a result the recorded and estimated impacts of tcja may change in future periods see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

 23 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

we rely heavily on our management team accordingly our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2017  we had 7592  employees globally approximately 16  of our 2608  usbased employees are unionized in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment 

 24 

including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or joint venture transactions or successfully integrate them into our business which could adversely affect our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates the ability to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to consummate a planned transaction and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions and joint venture transactions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

in addition if in connection with the tow joint venture we are unable to receive thirdparty financing on the terms previously contemplated and committed we may not achieve all of the benefits planned for the joint venture transaction 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

see note 14  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 13  noncurrent other liabilities  note 15  benefit obligations  and note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the credit agreement and the indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk respectively see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain 

 26 

financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness or pay dividends 

the credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the credit agreement contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the issuers assets or the assets of its subsidiaries 

in addition the indentures limit celanese us holdings llc celanese us and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell certain assets prepay or modify certain indebtedness and engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the senior notes and the credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017  was 20  compared to 12  for the year ended 2016  the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the enactment of the tcja on december 22 2017 we recognized net tax expense of 197 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 this expense of 197 million was partially offset by a 107 million reduction of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of lowering the us tax rate from 35 to 21 and other technical provisions in the tcja we also recognized a net tax benefit of 76 million related to foreign tax credits generated as a result of various internal reorganizations undertaken in preparation for our previously announced joint venture with the blackstone group lp the blackstone entities no material cash impact is expected from the deemed repatriation due to existing foreign tax credit carryforwards the 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted primarily due to settlement of uncertain tax positions and technical clarifications in germany and the us of 55 million  

the global minimum income tax and base erosion provisions of the tcja are effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 we do not currently expect the provisions of the tcja to have a material impact on our future tax rate 

due to the timing of the new tax law and the substantial changes it brings the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which provides registrants a measurement period to report the impact of the new us tax law during the measurement period provisional amounts for the effects of the law are recorded to the extent a reasonable estimate can be made to the extent that all information necessary is not available prepared or analyzed companies may recognize provisional estimated amounts for a period of up to one year following enactment of the tcja 

we have recorded provisional amounts for several of the impacts of the new tax law including the deemed repatriation tax on post1986 accumulated earnings and profits the deferred tax rate change effect of the new law gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances to offset foreign tax credit carryforwards certain items or estimates that result in impacts of the tcja being provisional include detailed foreign earnings calculations for the most recent period projected foreign cash balances for certain foreign subsidiaries and finalized computations of foreign tax credit availability in addition our 2017 us federal income tax return will not be finalized until later in 2018 and while historically this process has resulted in offsetting changes in estimates in current and deferred taxes for items which are timing related the reduction of the us tax rate will result in adjustments to our income tax provision benefit when recorded finally we consider it likely that further technical guidance regarding certain of the new provisions included in the tcja as well as clarity regarding state income tax conformity to current federal tax code may be issued

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2017  we have 903 million available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and 11 million  available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service for the next twelve months if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 300 million to 350 million in 2018 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our advanced engineered materials and acetyl intermediates segments 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include our engineered materials cellulose derivatives food ingredients emulsion polymers eva polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment we may engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist with this process the valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis and the discounted cash flow approach discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates 

 56 

growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

see note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world accordingly our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use handling processing storage and transportation of hazardous materials we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated depending on the nature of the site we accrue through 15 years  unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond 15 years  we estimate environmental liabilities on a casebycase basis using the most current status of available facts existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 

an environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include for example a provision for one or more of the following types of costs site investigation and testing costs cleanup costs costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and postremediation monitoring costs these undiscounted reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort we utilize third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for our sites changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur 

see note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

beginning in 2016 we elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans previously we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this change improves the correlation between projected benefit 

 57 

cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs this change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial gain loss reported we accounted for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016 

see note 15  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

the estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2018  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications prior settlements demands which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings 

see note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china singapore the united kingdom canada and france  we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

 58 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below 

see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments accounting policies related to financial market risk 

see note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 a portion of our assets liabilities net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that a one cent eurous dollar change in the exchange rate would impact our earnings by 5 million  annually

 14 

although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20 we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the united states us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions for example the us withdrawal from the transpacific partnership any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements including the north american free trade agreement or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy in addition it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements collect receivables receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss furthermore in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales for example in 2016  sales originating in europe accounted for approximately 40 of our net sales adverse conditions in the european economy related to the united kingdoms european union eu membership referendum or otherwise may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased enduse customer demand 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose derivatives in our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

 17 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

a portion of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway methanol llc fairway with mitsui  co ltd of tokyo japan in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas fairway began production in october 2015 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our advanced

engineered materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involves a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors furthermore some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse 

 19 

applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations andor changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws including antitrust and anticorruption laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws rules regulations and court decisions there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws rules regulations and court decisions which could result in fines penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation 

moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources   for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde may be classified in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example the international agency for research on cancer iarc a private research agency classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in addition several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia in october 2009 iarc concluded that there is sufficient evidence of a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia in 2011 the national toxicology program ntp released the 12th report on carcinogens which changed the classification of formaldehyde from reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen to known to be a human carcinogen similar to the iarc modification in 2009 the ntp report also implicates formaldehyde as a leukemogen we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act in the us as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals 

 20 

and new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of and minimize the disruption to our operations and operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances in addition we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned andor operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program cfats program which is administered by the department of homeland security dhs identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 cfats act was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of our nations chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions and cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation for instance the 2015 paris climate summit agreement resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions which ultimately could result in firm commitments by various nations with respect to future greenhouse gas emissions as such future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial

condition in any particular period see note 16  environmental  and note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates eu state aid rules in addition the organization of economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the us and many countries in the eu are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us if these offshore funds are needed for our operations in the us we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 22 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

we rely heavily on our management team accordingly our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2016  we had 7293  employees globally approximately 17  of our 2600  usbased employees are unionized in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate 

 23 

actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future   acquisitions into our business which could adversely affect our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

see note 14  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 13  noncurrent other liabilities  note 15  benefit obligations  and note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

 24 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the new credit agreement and the indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk respectively see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

 25 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness or pay dividends 

the new credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the new credit agreement contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the issuers assets or the assets of its subsidiaries 

in addition the indentures limit celanese us holdings llc celanese us and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur liens securing debt enter into saleleaseback transactions merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell certain assets prepay or modify certain indebtedness and engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the new credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the new credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if the lenders under the new credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the senior notes and the new credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the new credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the new credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the new credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the new credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

consolidated results 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015 

net sales decreased   285 million  or 50  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to 

 partially offset by 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased   90 million  or 178  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to 

 operating profit increased   567 million  or 1739  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to 

 partially offset by 

 equity in net earnings loss of affiliates decreased   26 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to 

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  was 12  compared to 41  for the year ended 2015  the lower effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowances in foreign jurisdictions due to internal restructuring in canada improved operating results in china and settlement of uncertain tax positions and technical clarifications in germany and the us in february 2015 we established a centralized european headquarters for the purpose of improving the operational efficiencies and profitability of our european operations and certain global product lines these activities directly impacted our mix of earnings and product flows and resulted in net favorable tax rate impacts in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

 39 

our effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts and mix of income and loss in those jurisdictions to which they relate as well as discrete items and nondeductible expenses that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

assuming no material changes to tax rules and regulations or cash repatriation plans we expect continued realization of operational savings in connection with the establishment of our centralized european headquarters which will directly impact the mix of our earnings and may result in favorable or unfavorable income tax impacts in subsequent years our effective tax rate will vary based on the jurisdictions in which income is actually generated and remains subject to potential volatility from changing tax legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions we continue to assess our business model and its impact in various jurisdictions on october 16 2016 the us department of the treasury released final and temporary section 385 regulations regarding corporate tax inversions and related earnings stripping these final and temporary regulations which are to be effective 90 days after finalization include provisions that may be interpreted to impact otherwise common tax structures including intercompany financing and obligations we have evaluated the tax consequences of the new regulations to our crossborder treasury management practices and intercompany financing structure and do not expect any material impact 

year ended december 31 2015  compared to year ended december 31 2014 

net sales decreased   11 billion  or 166  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased   252 million  or 332  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 

 operating profit decreased   432 million  or 570  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 

 partially offset by 

 operating margin for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased to 57  from 111  in 2014  

equity in net earnings loss of affiliates decreased   65 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 



 40 

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  was 41  compared to 33  for the year ended 2014  the higher effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance due to an increase in losses in jurisdictions with no tax benefit the increase in losses primarily relates to a 123 million  longlived asset impairment recorded to fully writeoff certain ethanol related assets at our acetyl facility in nanjing china and a 174 million charge related to the termination of a raw materials contract with a supplier in singapore see note 18  other charges gains net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information the tax impact of these events was partially offset by decreases in uncertain tax positions of 29 million due to audit closures and technical jurisdictional clarifications

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2016  we have 10 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and 52 million  available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2017  if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million in 2017 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our advanced engineered materials and acetyl intermediates segments 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2016  were 638 million  a decrease  of 329 million from december 31 2015  as of december 31 2016  552 million  of the 638 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not recorded any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 

 year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include our engineered materials cellulose derivatives food ingredients emulsion polymers eva polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment we may engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist with this process the valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis and the discounted cash flow approach discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss is recorded to write down the carrying amount an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

see note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections requires management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china singapore the united kingdom canada and france  we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

beginning in 2016 we elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans previously we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs this change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial gain loss reported we accounted for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016 

see note 15  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 56 

the estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2017  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications prior settlements demands which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below 

see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments accounting policies related to financial market risk 

see note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 a portion of our assets liabilities net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that a one cent eurous dollar change in the exchange rate would impact our earnings by 4 million  annually

cellulose derivatives strategic ventures our cellulose derivatives ventures generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on each ventures performance in the preceding year in 2015  2014  and 2013  we received cash dividends of 106 million  115 million  and 92 million  respectively 

although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20 we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have operations and customers 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german european union eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and consequently our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales and approximately 40 in 2015  adverse conditions in the european economy may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased enduse customer demand 

finally conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the us europe asia or elsewhere 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of natural disasters plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide 

 16 

may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative and any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

a portion of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained from our joint venture fairway methanol llc fairway with mitsui  co ltd of tokyo japan in which we own a 50 interest for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas fairway began production in october 2015 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

 17 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our advanced engineered materials segment our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involve a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we rely on our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets and patents and other technology licensed from third parties to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products we have adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes and products described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 18 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition products we produce including vam formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde may be classified in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products for example the international agency for research on cancer iarc a private research agency classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans group 1 based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in addition several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia in october 2009 iarc concluded that there is sufficient evidence of a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia in 2011 the national toxicology program ntp released the 12th report on carcinogens which changed the classification of formaldehyde from reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen to known to be a human carcinogen similar to the iarc modification in 2009 the ntp report also implicates formaldehyde as a leukemogen we anticipate that the results of the iarcs and the ntps reviews will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act tsca in the us as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 19 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

our operations are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program cfats program which is administered by the department of homeland security dhs identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 cfats act was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of our nations chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu while not all are likely to become law many countries are considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 16  environmental  and note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world in particular proposed us tax legislation could materially impact our results currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs 

 20 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us consequently fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period therefore increases or decreases in value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2015  we had 7081  employees approximately 18  of our 2660  usbased employees are unionized at the largest union site narrows virginia we successfully concluded contract negotiations on a three year contract in april 2014 this contract settled without any labor dispute or unrest we announced the closing of our other usbased union site meredosia illinois in october 2015 unionized employees began departing the site in december 2015 and we anticipate that a majority of all employees will have departed the site by the end of the first quarter of 2016 we have conducted the required effects bargaining negotiations with the union and an agreement was reached on severance and other benefits without a labor dispute 

in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

 22 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future   acquisitions into our business which could adversely affect our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

see note 14  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 13  noncurrent other liabilities  note 15  benefit obligations  and note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

  23 

to use our cash flow to fund operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our common stock 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the amended credit agreement and the indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk respectively see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness or pay dividends 

the amended credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the amended credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

the amended credit agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make 

 24 

investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates enter into saleleaseback transactions or hedge transactions or engage in other businesses 

in addition the indentures limit celanese uss and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional debt pay dividends or make other restricted payments consummate specified asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to celanese us and its restricted subsidiaries merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness or engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the amended credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the amended credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if we were unable to repay or refinance such indebtedness the lenders under the amended credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the amended credit agreement if the lenders under the amended credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the senior notes and the amended credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the amended credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the amended credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the amended credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the amended credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

consolidated results 

year ended december 31 2015  compared to year ended december 31 2014   

net sales decreased   11 billion  or 166  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased   252 million  or 332  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to

 operating profit decreased   432 million  or 570  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 

 partially offset by 

 operating margin for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased to 57   from 111   in 2014  

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 65 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to 

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  was 41  compared to 33  for the year ended 2014  the higher effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance due to an increase in losses in jurisdictions with no tax benefit the increase in losses primarily relates to a 123 million  longlived asset impairment recorded to fully writeoff certain ethanol related assets at our acetyl facility in nanjing china and a 174 million  charge related to the termination of a raw materials contract with a supplier in singapore see note 18  other charges gains net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information the tax impact of these events was partially offset by decreases in uncertain tax positions of 29 million  due to audit closures and technical jurisdictional clarifications 

our effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts and mix of income and loss in those jurisdictions to which they relate as well as discrete items and nondeductible expenses that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year 

in 2015 we established a centralized european headquarters in the netherlands for the purpose of improving the operational efficiencies and profitability of our european operations and certain global product lines and to centralize leadership and management functions in a single location a key objective of our european headquarters is to align our business operations identify cost savings and further streamline our operations these activities directly impacted our mix of earnings and product flows and resulted in both favorable and unfavorable tax rate impacts in the jurisdictions in which we operate these impacts have been reflected in other foreign tax rate differentials included in the reconciliation of the significant differences between the us federal and statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

assuming no material changes to tax rules and regulations or cash repatriation plans we expect to realize operational savings in connection with the establishment of our centralized european headquarters which will directly impact the mix of our earnings and may result in favorable income tax impacts in subsequent years our effective tax rate will vary based on the jurisdictions in which income is actually generated and remains subject to potential volatility from changing tax legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions we continue to assess our business model and its impact in various jurisdictions

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2015  we have 550 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations during the year ended december 31 2015  we had net borrowings of 350 million  under our revolving credit facility primarily to fund 420 million  in repurchases of our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2016  if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million in 2016 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our industrial specialties segment 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on common stock 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2015  were 967 million  an increase  of 187 million from december 31 2014  as of december 31 2015  923 million  of the 967 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations

debt and other obligations 

senior notes 

we have outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in public offerings registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended as follows collectively the senior notes 



the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of celanese us and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of celanese us the senior notes were issued under indentures collectively the indentures among celanese us celanese and each of the domestic subsidiaries of celanese us that guarantee its obligations under its senior secured credit facilities subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by celanese and the subsidiary guarantors the indentures contain covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments engage in transactions with affiliates or engage in other businesses celanese us may redeem some or all of each of the senior notes prior to their respective maturity dates at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus a makewhole premium as specified in the applicable indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the redemption date 

in october 2014  celanese us redeemed its 600 million   6625  senior unsecured notes due 2018   6625  notes at a redemption price of 103313  of the face amount for a total principal and premium payment of 620 million  plus accrued interest of 20 million  proceeds from the issuance of the 3250  notes were used to partially fund the redemption of the 6625  notes as well as cash on hand we recorded a loss on extinguishment of the 6625  notes of 24 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  which included the redemption premium of 20 million  and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of 4 million  

 51 

 in september 2014 celanese us celanese and certain of the domestic subsidiaries of celanese us entered into an amendment agreement with the lenders under celanese uss existing senior secured credit facilities in order to amend and restate the amended credit agreement dated september 16 2013 as amended and restated by the 2014 amendment agreement the amended credit agreement under the amended credit agreement all of the us dollar denominated term c2 term loans and all but €28 million  of the eurodenominated term c2 term loans under the 2013 amended credit agreement were converted into or refinanced by the term c3 loan facility with an extended maturity date of october 2018 the nonextended portions of the term c2 loan facility continue to have a maturity date of october 2016 in addition the maturity date of our revolving credit facility was extended to october 2018 and the facility was increased to 900 million  accordingly the amended credit agreement consists of the term c2 loan facility the term c3 loan facility and a 900 million  revolving credit facility we borrowed 550 million  and repaid 200 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  borrowings were primarily used to fund repurchases of our common stock 

as of december 31 2015  the margin for borrowings under the term c2 loan facility was 20  above the euro interbank offered rate euribor and the margin for borrowings under the term c3 loan facility was 225  above london interbank offered rate libor for us dollars and 225  above euribor for euros as applicable as of december 31 2015  the margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was 15  above libor the margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances based on changes in the corporate credit ratings of celanese or celanese us 

term loan borrowings under the amended credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1  of the initial principal amount per annum payable quarterly in addition we pay quarterly commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility of 025  per annum 

the amended credit agreement is guaranteed by celanese and certain domestic subsidiaries of celanese us and is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of celanese us and such guarantors subject to certain agreed exceptions including for certain real property and certain shares of foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the guarantee and collateral agreement dated april 2 2007 

as a condition to borrowing funds or requesting letters of credit be issued under the revolving credit facility our first lien senior secured leverage ratio as calculated as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered under the revolving facility cannot exceed the threshold as specified below further our first lien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

our first lien senior secured leverage ratios under the revolving credit facility are as follows 

the amended credit agreement contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates enter into saleleaseback transactions or hedge transactions or engage in other businesses as well as a covenant requiring maintenance of a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio 

the amended credit agreement also maintains a number of events of default including a cross default to other debt of celanese celanese us or their subsidiaries including the senior notes in an aggregate amount equal to more than 50 million  and the occurrence of a change of control failure to comply with these covenants or the occurrence of any other event of default could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations under the amended credit agreement 

we are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of december 31 2015

share capital 

our board of directors follows a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of our common stock unless the board of directors in its sole discretion determines otherwise the amount available to pay cash dividends is restricted by our amended credit agreement and the indentures 

on february 4 2016  we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 030  per share on our common stock amounting to 44 million  the cash dividend is for the period from november 1 2015  to january 31 2016  and will be paid on february 26 2016  to holders of record as of february 16 2016  cash dividends to be paid in 2016  are expected to be slightly higher than the cash dividends paid in 2015  based on the number of outstanding shares as of december 31 2015  and a quarterly cash dividend rate of 030  

our board of directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of 24 billion  of our common stock since february 2008 these authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased this repurchase program does not have an expiration date during the year ended december 31 2015  we spent 420 million  on repurchased shares of our common stock as of december 31 2015  we had 10 billion  remaining under authorizations by our board of directors

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include our engineered materials cellulose derivatives food ingredients emulsion polymers eva polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

 54 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment we may engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist with this process the valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis and the discounted cash flow approach discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss is recorded to write down the carrying amount an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

see note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

 55 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

see note 10  property plant and equipment net  and note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china singapore the united kingdom canada and france  we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

see note 15  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 56 

the estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2016  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications prior settlements demands which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below 

see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments accounting policies related to financial market risk 

see note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations

 as of december 31 2015  we had 11 billion €176 million and cny234 million of variable rate debt and us dollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 500 million  that expired january 2 2016 these interest rate swap agreements had the economic effect of modifying the us dollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations 

 a portion of our assets liabilities net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that a one cent eurous dollar change in the exchange rate would impact our earnings by 5 million annually

although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20 we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap

backlog 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of net sales or financial performance

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have significant operations 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment 

our operations are also subject to global political conditions in certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies 

failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german european union eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales and approximately 40 in 2014 adverse conditions in the european economy may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased enduse customer demand 

as of december 31 2014  we held 392 million in cash in europe this cash is primarily invested in deposits in several european banks and us treasury money market funds the allocation of the cash invested in each of these options fluctuates based on market conditions as of december 31 2014  we also had 113 million of direct investments in european sovereign debt and corporate bonds in our pension funds accounting for less than 4 of our total pension fund assets which may be affected if there are adverse conditions in the european economy our ability to access additional liquidity from european financial institutions in the future may also be impaired 

finally conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the us europe asia or elsewhere 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production as well as significant amounts of 

 16 

wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of natural disasters plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene or services although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier furthermore if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative and any such alternative could result in increased costs it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier 

a portion of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained under a contract expiring in 2015 we are currently constructing a methanol plant in the us that we anticipate will be operational in the second half of 2015 to replace the majority of the methanol obtained under that contract we have secured a bridge supply agreement that will supply us with methanol through the end of 2015 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and 

 17 

formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involve a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we attach importance to our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets in order to protect our investment in research and development and competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing of our products we have also adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition we sometimes license patents and other technology from third parties our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes and products described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our net sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 18 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition furthermore adverse conditions in the european economy could increase the likelihood and impact of these events for our european customers by potentially limiting enduse customer demand and restricting our customers access to capital which could continue to negatively affect our financial results 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for further information 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products in addition vam or other chemicals we produce may be classified in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer iarc a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in october 2009 iarc also concluded based on a recent study that there is sufficient evidence for a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia we expect the results of iarcs review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act tsca in the us as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach 

the abovementioned assessments in the us and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit 

 19 

the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities including facilities we own andor operate handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

our operations are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

regulations are being implemented by the us department of homeland security dhs aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the us pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and security plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation in addition cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu 

while not all are likely to become law many countries are considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period see note 16  environmental  and note 24  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world in particular proposed us tax legislation could materially impact our results currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs 

 20 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

because we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors whose principal operations are conducted in the us on the same products sold in the same industries and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies unless we have cash flows in those foreign currencies from our foreign operations to repay such indebtedness 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

 21 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2014  we had 7468  employees approximately 18  of our 2877  usbased employees are unionized our two usbased collective bargaining agreements expire in 2016 and 2017 at the largest union site narrows virginia we successfully concluded contract negotiations on a three year contract in april 2014 this contract settled without any labor dispute or unrest planning for our meredosia illinois negotiations a site of only 25 union represented employees will begin in 2015 and we expect to successfully conclude negotiations by january 2016 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock par value 00001 per share common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

 22 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future   acquisitions into our business which could adversely affect our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

see note 14  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness see note 13  noncurrent other liabilities  note 15  benefit obligations  and note 16  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including

to use our cash flow to fund operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our common stock 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the amended credit agreement and the indentures limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate and euro denominated indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest or are euro denominated which exposes us to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk respectively see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness or pay dividends 

the amended credit agreement the indentures and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the amended credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

the amended credit agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make 

 24 

investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates enter into saleleaseback transactions or hedge transactions or engage in other businesses 

in addition the indentures limit celanese uss and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional debt pay dividends or make other restricted payments consummate specified asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to celanese us and its restricted subsidiaries merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness or engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the amended credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the amended credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if we were unable to repay or refinance such indebtedness the lenders under the amended credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the amended credit agreement if the lenders under the amended credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the senior notes and the amended credit agreement by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the amended credit agreement and the indentures by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the amended credit agreement and the indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the amended credit agreement the indentures the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the amended credit agreement and the indentures by celanese or our other indebtedness

net sales increased   292 million  or 45  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to higher vinyl acetate monomer vam and acetic acid pricing in our acetyl intermediates segment and higher volume globally in our advanced engineered materials segment fueled by growth in automotive medical and industrial applications 

selling general and administrative expenses increased   447 million  or 1437  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to an increase in pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit cost of 379 million  higher functional and project spending of 43 million and an increase in incentive compensation costs of 25 million 

other charges gains net changed 173 million  or 1095  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to 138 million  of lower charges in our acetyl intermediates segment the lower charges were a result of the impact of permanent capacity reductions in europe in december 2013 accordingly we recorded 20 million  of 

 38 

employee termination benefits 33 million  of contract termination costs and 34 million  of longlived asset impairment losses during the three months ended december 31 2013 we also recorded longlived asset impairment losses of 46 million  related to our singapore acetic acid production unit during that period see note 18  other charges gains net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating profit decreased   750 million  or 497  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  reflective of an increase in selling general and administrative expenses and the recognition of a gain of 742 million  during the three months ended december 31 2013  which represented the deferred proceeds in excess of divested assets as a result of the 2006 settlement agreement with the frankfurt germany airport fraport to move our german polyacetal pom operations the proceeds were included in our advanced engineered materials segment see note 28  plant relocation  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information the decrease was partially offset by higher vam and acetic acid pricing in our acetyl intermediates segment as well as the impact of permanent capacity reductions in europe in december 2013 operating margin for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased to 111   from 232   in 2013  

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 66 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to a 48 million  gain resulting from restructuring the debt of a subsidiary of infraserv gmbh  co hoechst kg during the three months ended june 30 2014 and an increase in equity investment earnings of 13 million  from our polyplastics co ltd polyplastics strategic affiliate our equity investment in infraserv gmbh  co hoechst kg is owned primarily by an entity included in other activities 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014  was 33  compared to 32  for the year ended december 31 2013  

we begin 2015 with a strong core business and specific productivity initiatives that will help mitigate some of the anticipated volatility in the macroeconomic environment our focus will be on the things we can control such as energy savings efficiencies in plant operations and increased alignment of our applications and product development pipeline to fit our customers needs and growth these initiatives combined with our underlying business should contribute to earnings in 2015 

consolidated results – year ended december 31 2013  compared with year ended december 31 2012   

net sales increased   92 million  or 14  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to higher volume in our advanced engineered materials segment resulting from increased penetration in automotive applications in the americas and asia and targeted growth programs within asia for our consumer and industrial applications 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased   519 million  or 625  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to a decrease in pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit cost of 500 million  

other charges gains net changed 144 million  or 10286  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to 141 million  of higher expenses in our acetyl intermediates segment primarily related to the closure of our acetic anhydride facility in roussillon france and our vam facility in tarragona spain as well as longlived impairment losses related to our singapore acetic acid production unit see note 18  other charges gains net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating profit increased   1333 million  or 7617  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  reflective of increased net sales decreased selling general and administrative expenses and the december 2013  recognition of a gain of 742 million  which represented the deferred proceeds in excess of divested assets as a result of the 2006 settlement agreement with fraport to move our german pom operations 

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 62 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to 19 million  of lower earnings from our ibn sina affiliate and 18 million  of lower earnings in our polyplastics affiliate both included in our advanced engineered materials segment during the year ended december 31 2013  our infraserv hoechst affiliate recorded onetime employee termination benefits resulting in a reduction of net earnings of affiliates of 8 million  of which 1 million  was attributable to our consumer specialties segment 2 million  to our acetyl intermediates segment and 5 million  to other activities 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013  was 32  compared to 17  for the year ended december 31 2012  the effective tax rate for 2012 was favorably impacted by foreign tax credit carryforwards realized in the us and offset by deferred tax charges related to changes in assessment regarding permanent reinvestment of certain foreign earnings

equity in net earnings loss of affiliates decreased 42 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to decreases in equity investment earnings from our ibn sina and polyplastics strategic affiliates of 19 million  and 18 million  respectively the decrease in ibn sina equity investment earnings was largely the result of the timing of turnaround activity lower methyl tertiarybutyl ether pricing and lower sales volume polyplastics equity investment earnings decreased due to slightly lower pricing higher turnaround and sales expenses and restructuring charges related to one of their affiliates

net sales increased   69 million  or 60  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to higher pricing and volume in our emulsion polymers business pricing increased primarily due to higher raw material costs for vam in europe asia and north america volume increases were driven by a targeted strategy in asia primarily in adhesive and construction products and paints and coatings products and by higher demand in europe 

operating profit increased   12 million  or 188  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily attributable to higher pricing and volume operating profit benefited from increased pricing and volume in our emulsion polymers business and a decrease in net periodic benefit cost of 21 million  these increases were partially offset by higher raw material prices primarily vam of 65 million in our emulsion polymers business across all regions 

year ended december 31 2013  compared with year ended   december 31 2012 

net sales decreased   29 million  or 24  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily reflecting lower pricing for both the emulsion polymers and eva polymers businesses partially offset by favorable currency impacts resulting from a strong euro and chinese renminbi to the us dollar lower pricing in our emulsion polymers business was driven by lower raw material costs across all regions primarily vam in europe and asia and ethylene in north america lower pricing across all product lines in our eva polymers business was driven by lower raw material costs primarily ethylene lower demand in asia and north america as well as strong supply into several enduse applications including hot melt adhesives and photovoltaic cells 

operating profit decreased   22 million  or 256  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  reflecting lower pricing in our eva polymers businesses and an increase in net periodic benefit cost of 5 million  

acetyl intermediates 

our acetyl intermediates segment includes our intermediate chemistry business which produces and supplies acetyl products including acetic acid vam acetic anhydride and acetate esters these products are generally used as starting materials for colorants paints adhesives coatings and medicines this business segment also produces organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical products 

year ended december 31 2014  compared with year ended   december 31 2013 

net sales increased   252 million  or 78  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to higher vam pricing resulting from permanent capacity reductions in europe and planned and unplanned industry outages slightly offset by lower volume net sales also benefited from higher acetic acid pricing resulting from planned and unplanned industry outages as well as higher acetic anhydride pricing 

operating profit increased   405 million  or 2647  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to higher vam acetic acid and acetic anhydride pricing operating profit also benefited from the impact of

permanent capacity reductions in europe in december 2013 accordingly we recorded 20 million  of employee termination benefits 33 million  of contract termination costs and 34 million  of longlived asset impairment losses to fully writeoff the related property plant and equipment during the year ended december 31 2013 which did not recur during the year ended december 31 2014  longlived asset impairment losses of 46 million  were also recorded during the year ended december 31 2013 to fully writeoff the property plant and equipment at our singapore acetic acid production unit operating profit was also impacted by a decrease in net periodic benefit cost of 23 million  the increase in operating profit was partially offset by lower volume and higher raw material costs of 98 million primarily ethylene and purchased materials for vam and acetic acid as well as a 12 million loss as a result of damages in connection with a settlement of a claim by a raw materials supplier 

equity in net earnings loss of affiliates increased 15 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to a  13 million  gain resulting from restructuring the debt of a subsidiary of infraserv gmbh  co hoechst kg during the three months ended june 30 2014 

year ended december 31 2013  compared with year ended   december 31 2012 

net sales increased   10 million  or 03  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  reflecting slightly higher volume due to muted demand offset by pricing pressure on derivatives particularly in europe and asia 

operating profit decreased   116 million  or 431  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to the negative impact of other charges gains net of 141 million  as a result of the closure of our acetic anhydride facility in roussillon france and our vam facility in tarragona spain in december 2013 longlived asset impairment losses of 46 million were also recorded during the three months ended december 31 2013 to fully writeoff the property plant and equipment at our singapore acetic acid production unit partially offsetting the negative impact of other charges gains net were increases to operating profit for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  resulting from lower raw material costs mainly ethylene and a decrease to net periodic benefit cost of 14 million  

other activities 



other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including financing and administrative activities such as legal accounting and treasury functions interest income and expense associated with our financing activities and results of our captive insurance companies other activities also includes the interest cost expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses components of our net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans which are not allocated to our business segments 

year ended december 31 2014  compared with year ended   december 31 2013 

operating profit decreased   526 million  or 12829  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to an increase in net periodic benefit cost of 454 million  primarily recorded to selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses was also unfavorably impacted by higher functional and project spending of 43 million and an increase in incentive compensation costs of 25 million  due to exceeding internal profitability targets 

equity in net earnings loss of affiliates increased 32 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  primarily due to a 29 million  gain resulting from restructuring the debt of a subsidiary of infraserv gmbh  co hoechst kg during the three months ended june 30 2014

operating profit increased   567 million  or 1078  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to a decrease in net periodic benefit cost of 542 million  primarily recorded to selling general and administrative expenses and a decrease in other charges gains net of 8 million  other charges gains net was lower for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily due to the absence of 9 million in insurance losses paid compared to the same period in 2012  these charges were offset in our consumer specialties segment in 2012  

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2014  we have 900 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and 21 million  available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2015  if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

in february 2014 we formed a joint venture fairway with mitsui in which we own 50  of fairway for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas the planned methanol unit will utilize natural gas in the us gulf coast region as a feedstock and will benefit from the existing infrastructure at our clear lake facility as a result the total shared capital and expense investment in the facility is estimated to be in the range of 875 million to 900 million including 100 million of installed infrastructure our portion of the investment is estimated to be in the range of 350 million to 375 million  excluding the 100 million of previously invested assets at our clear lake facility the planned methanol unit will have an annual capacity of 13 million  tons and is expected to be operational in the second half of 2015 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures including the fairway project are expected to be in the range of 375 million to 400 million in 2015  primarily due to our portion of the investment in the construction of the clear lake methanol unit and additional investments in growth opportunities in our advanced engineered materials and industrial specialties segments 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on common stock 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2014  were 780 million  a decrease  of 204 million from december 31 2013  as of december 31 2014  669 million  of the 780 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 

 year ended december 31 2014  compared with year ended december 31 2013 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased  by 200 million for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  with operating cash inflows increasing  from 762 million  to 962 million  cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31 2014   increased  primarily as a result of stronger earnings performance an increase in valueadded tax refunds of 87 million and a 23 million  increase in dividends received from our cellulose derivatives ventures these favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of 127 million  in pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan contributions made during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the prior year and a 70 million  increase in cash taxes paid 

 45 

year ended december 31 2013  compared with year ended december 31 2012 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased  by 40 million for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012 the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily the result of stronger earnings performance and a reduction in pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan contributions of 192 million  made during the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the prior year these favorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in dividends from our equity investments of 121 million  primarily due to the absence of a 75 million cash dividend received from polyplastics in 2012 as a result of an amendment to our joint venture and other related agreements and a 65 million  increase in cash taxes paid 

trade working capital is calculated as follows 

 year ended december 31 2014  compared with year ended december 31 2013

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include our engineered materials cellulose derivatives food ingredients emulsion polymers eva polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 

when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key 

 50 

assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment we may engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist with this process the valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis and the discounted cash flow approach discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss is recorded to write down the carrying amount an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

see note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

see note 10  property plant and equipment net  and note 11  goodwill and intangible assets net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg spain china singapore the united kingdom and canada as well as other foreign jurisdictions  we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

see note 19  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured assumptions are reviewed on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook 

see note 15  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

the estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2015  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications prior settlements demands which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below 

see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments accounting policies related to financial market risk 

see note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 53 

 in december 2014 we dedesignated as cash flow hedges the notional value of 500 million  us dollar interest rate swap agreements expiring january 2 2016  and a loss of 3 million  was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net into interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended december 31 2014 future marktomarket adjustments on these dedesignated interest rate swap agreements will be recorded in interest expense through their expiration see note 22  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2014  we had 774 million €178 million and cny380 million of variable rate debt and us dollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 500 million  that expire january 2 2016 these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the us dollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 6 million 

 a portion of our assets liabilities net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that a one cent eurous dollar change in the exchange rate would impact our earnings by 6 million annually

our strategic affiliates represent an important component of our strategy for accelerated growth and global expansion we have a substantial portfolio of affiliates in various regions including asiapacific north america and the middle east these affiliates some of which date back as far as the 1960s have sizeable operations and are significant within their industries 

our strategic affiliates have similar growth patterns and business models as our core businesses with shared characteristics such as products applications and manufacturing technology these strategic affiliates complement and extend our technology and specialty materials portfolio we have historically entered into these investments to gain access to local demand minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential depending on the level of investment and other factors we account for our strategic affiliates using either the equity method or cost method of accounting 

our strategic affiliates contribute substantial sales earnings and cash flows during the year ended december 31 2013  our equity method strategic affiliates generated combined sales of 3 billion resulting in our recording 148 million  of equity in net earnings of affiliates and 121 million  of dividends in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  

 12 

our strategic affiliates   as of december 31 2013  are as follows 

national methanol company ibn sina national methanol company represents approximately 1 of the worlds methanol production capacity and is one of the worlds largest producers of methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe a gasoline additive its production facilities are located in saudi arabia we indirectly own a 25 interest in ibn sina through cte petrochemicals company a 5050 joint venture with texas eastern arabian corporation ltd which also indirectly owns a 25 interest the remaining 50 interest in ibn sina is held by the saudi basic industries corporation sabic sabic is responsible for all product marketing methanol is a key feedstock for pom production and is produced by our ibn sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs in our engineered materials business 

in april 2010 we announced that ibn sina will construct a 50000 ton pom production facility in saudi arabia the new facility will supply pom to support advanced engineered materials accelerated future growth plans as well as our venture partners regional business development upon successful startup of the pom facility our indirect economic interest in ibn sina will increase from 25 to 325 sabics economic interest will remain unchanged 

korea engineering plastics co ltd kepco is the leading producer of pom in south korea kepco is a venture between celanese holdings bv 50 ownership and a whollyowned subsidiary of celanese gmbh mitsubishi gas chemical company inc 40 and mitsubishi corporation 10 kepco has polyacetal production facilities in ulsan south korea compounding facilities for pbt and nylon in pyongtaek south korea and participates with polyplastics and mitsubishi gas chemical company inc in a worldscale pom facility in nantong china

cellulose derivatives strategic ventures we hold ownership interest in three separate acetate flake and acetate tow production ventures in china as follows nantong cellulose fibers co ltd 31 kunming cellulose fibers co ltd 30 and zhuhai cellulose fibers co ltd 30 the china national tobacco corporation the chinese stateowned tobacco entity controls the remaining ownership interest in each of these ventures 

our cellulose derivatives ventures generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on the ventures performance for the preceding year prior to 2013 the ventures paid dividends during the second quarter of each fiscal 

 13 

year beginning in 2013 the ventures pay dividends on a quarterly basis in 2013  2012  and 2011  we received cash dividends of 92 million  83 million  and 78 million  respectively 

in 2012 our nantong venture completed an expansion of its acetate flake and acetate tow capacity each by 30000 tons we made contributions of 29 million from 2009 through 2012 related to the capacity expansion in nantong similar expansions since the ventures were formed have led to earnings growth and increased dividends for the company 

according to the euromonitor database services china is estimated to have had a 42 share of the worlds 2012 cigarette consumption cigarette consumption in china is expected to grow at a rate of 19 per year from 2012 through 2017 combined these ventures are a leader in chinese domestic acetate production and we believe we are well positioned to supply chinese cigarette producers 

although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20 we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 

 infraservs we hold indirect ownership interests in several german infraserv groups that own and develop industrial parks and provide onsite general and administrative support to tenants our ownership interest in the equity investments in infraserv affiliates are as follows 

research and development 

our businesses are innovationoriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications we consider the amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be sufficient to execute our current strategic initiatives 

intellectual property 

we attach importance to protecting our intellectual property including through patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to preserve our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing patents may cover processes products intermediate products and product uses we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our company and products we protect our intellectual property against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate 

patents  in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for certain unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor competitive developments and defend against infringements on our intellectual property rights

the approximate number of employees employed by celanese on a continuing basis throughout the world is as follows 

backlog 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have significant operations 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the us germany china japan malaysia south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices also our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

in addition conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the us europe asia or elsewhere 

failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in reporting requirements of the us canadian mexican german european union eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe historically sales originating in europe have accounted for over onethird of our net sales and more than 40 in 2013 adverse conditions in the european economy may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased enduse customer demand 

as of december 31 2013  we held 219 million in cash in europe this cash is primarily invested in deposits in several european banks a european money market fund that invests only in highly rated and liquid european sovereign debt and a us treasury money market fund the allocation of the cash invested in each of these options fluctuates based on market conditions as of december 31 2013  we also had 106 million of direct investments in european sovereign debt and corporate bonds in our pension funds accounting for less than 4 of our total pension fund assets which may be affected if there are adverse conditions in the european economy finally our ability to access additional liquidity from european financial institutions in the future may also be impaired 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vae emulsions and eva production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in 

 16 

our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of natural disasters plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas and electricity the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we have a practice of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and ethylene although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole supplier 

a portion of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained under a contract expiring in 2015 we are currently constructing a methanol plant in the us that we anticipate will be operational in the second half of 2015 to replace the majority of the methanol obtained under that contract we have secured a bridge supply agreement that will supply us with methanol through the end of 2015 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operation to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

 17 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected however as we invest in new technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food and beverage cigarette automobile aerospace medical device and pharmaceutical industries involve a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins 

we attach importance to our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets in order to protect our investment in research and development and competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing of our products we have also adopted internal policies for protecting our knowhow and trade secrets in addition we sometimes license patents and other technology from third parties our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes and products described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 18 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products these risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors in addition many of these industries are cyclical in nature thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition furthermore adverse conditions in the european economy could increase the likelihood and impact of these events for our european customers by potentially limiting enduse customer demand and restricting our customers access to capital which could continue to negatively affect our financial results 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations 

we are currently impacted by the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters boiler mact which was published by the environmental protection agency epa in the federal register on march 21 2011 and revised on december 20 2012 the boiler mact regulation requires us to make significant capital expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for industrial boilers and process heaters at our narrows virginia facility consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for further information related to the boiler mact project 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products 

in june 2009 the california office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha formally proposed to add vam along with 11 other substances to a list of chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer oehha is required to maintain this list under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 proposition 65 celanese successfully defeated the attempt to list vam through a judicial challenge that is now final and oehha has withdrawn vam from its list of proposed chemicals for the proposition 65 list however oehha initially proposed vam to the proposition 65 list as a result of a lawsuit by an environmental group activists may again seek to require oehha to consider listing vam or other chemicals we produce on the proposition 65 list in addition vam or other chemicals we produce may be classified in other jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer iarc a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans 

 19 

in october 2009 iarc also concluded based on a recent study that there is sufficient evidence for a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia we expect the results of iarcs review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act tsca in the us as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach 

the abovementioned assessments in the us and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities including facilities we own and or operate handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

our operations are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

these operating and other risks can cause personal injury property damage thirdparty damages and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility our operating results and cash flows 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

regulations are being implemented by the us department of homeland security dhs aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the us pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and security plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention for example the epa has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation in addition cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu 

while not all are likely to become law many countries are considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable 

 20 

estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings below 

changes in tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world in particular proposed us tax legislation could materially impact our results currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

because we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors whose principal operations are conducted in the us on the same products sold in the same industries and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies unless we have cash flows in those foreign currencies from our foreign operations to repay such indebtedness 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of 

 21 

our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of our reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 7430  employees approximately 19  of our 2800  us based employees are unionized our two us based collective bargaining agreements expire in 2014 and 2016 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives and the chances are low a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant see note 4  acquisitions dispositions ventures and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future   acquisitions into our business which could adversely affect our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame that we anticipate or at all which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

our total indebtedness is 31 billion  as of december 31 2013  see note 13  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information we also have numerous other obligations see note 12  noncurrent other liabilities  note 14  benefit obligations  and note 15  environmental  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have important consequences including 

  23 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the amended credit agreement and the indentures governing the 600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due 2018 the 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2021 and the 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior notes due 2022 together the senior notes limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the senior notes would increase 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase as of december 31 2013  we had 790 million  €192 million  and cny470 million  of variable rate debt and outstanding usdollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 11 billion  that expire january 2 2014 and additional usdollar interest rate swap agreements with notional value of 500 million  that are in effect january 2 2014 and expire january 2 2016 these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the usdollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 6 million  

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 21  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the amended credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness or pay dividends 

the amended credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the receivables purchase agreement the purchase agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the amended credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

 24 

the amended credit agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on the company’s ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates enter into saleleaseback transactions or hedge transactions or engage in other businesses 

in addition the indentures governing the senior notes limit celanese uss and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional debt pay dividends or make other restricted payments consummate specified asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to celanese us and its restricted subsidiaries merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

the purchase agreement also contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on ce receivables llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the company and certain other company subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness or engage in other businesses 

such restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the senior notes in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the amended credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the amended credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if we were unable to repay or refinance such indebtedness the lenders under the amended credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the amended credit agreement if the lenders under the amended credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the senior notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the senior notes by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the senior notes and the guarantee of the celanese uss obligations under the senior notes by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the senior notes the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the senior notes by celanese or our other indebtedness

results of operations 

change in accounting policy regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 

effective january 1 2013 we elected to change our accounting policy for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans we now immediately recognize changes in fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of net periodic benefit cost are recorded on a quarterly basis for further discussion see note 2  summary of accounting policies  and note 14  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the changes in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits and to properly match the actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring we changed our allocation of net periodic benefit cost we now allocate only the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of our pension and postretirement plans to each business segment on a ratable basis all other components of net periodic benefit cost interest cost estimated return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses are recorded to other activities as these components are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level financial information for prior periods has been retrospectively adjusted

selected data by business segment

factors affecting business segment net sales 

the percentage increase decrease in net sales attributable to each of the factors indicated for each of our business segments is as follows 

year ended december 31 2013  compared to year ended december 31 2012 

year ended december 31 2012  compared to year ended december 31 2011 

consolidated results – year ended december 31 2013  compared with year ended december 31 2012   

net sales increased   92 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to higher volumes in our advanced engineered materials segment resulting from increased penetration in automotive applications in the americas and asia and targeted growth programs within asia for our consumer and industrial applications 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased   519 million  or 625  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to the impact of pension and other postretirement plan activity of 513 million selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 48  in 2013  from 129  in 2012  

the favorable impact of pension and other postretirement plan activity for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  includes a change in net actuarial gain loss recorded to other activities of 451 million a net settlement curtailment gain related to actions taken on certain pension plans in the us the united kingdom and canada allocated across the appropriate business segments and other activities of 23 million lower interest cost and expected return on plan assets recorded to other activities of 34 million and prior service credit amortization related to a us postretirement health care plan allocated across all business segments and other activities of 5 million see note 14  benefit obligations  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this activity 

other charges gains net changed 144 million  or 10286  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to 141 million  of higher expenses in our acetyl intermediates segment in december 2013 we closed our acetic anhydride facility in roussillon france and our vinyl acetate monomer vam facility in tarragona spain accordingly we recorded 20 million  of employee termination benefits 33 million  of contract termination costs and 34 million  of longlived asset impairment losses during the three months ended december 31 2013 we also recorded longlived asset impairment losses of 46 million  related to our singapore acetic acid production unit during this period see note 17  other charges gains net  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these charges 

operating profit increased   1333 million  or 7617  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  reflective of increased net sales decreased selling general and administrative expenses and the december 2013 recognition of a gain of 742 million  which represents the deferred proceeds in excess of divested assets as a result of the 2006 settlement agreement with the frankfurt germany airport fraport to move our german polyacetal pom operations the proceeds are included in our advanced engineered materials segment see note 27  plant relocation  in the 

 40 

accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information these increases more than offset the negative impact of other charges gains net operating profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended 2013  increased to 232  from 27  in 2012 

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 62 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to 19 million  of lower earnings from our ibn sina affiliate and 18 million  of lower earnings in our polyplastics affiliate both included in our advanced engineered materials segment during the year ended december 31 2013 our infraserv hoechst affiliate recorded onetime employee termination benefits resulting in a reduction of net earnings of affiliates of 8 million  of which 1 million  was attributable to our consumer specialties segment 2 million  to our acetyl intermediates segment and 5 million  to other activities 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013  was 32  compared to 17  for the year ended december 31 2012  the effective tax rate for 2012 was favorably impacted by foreign tax credit carryforwards realized in the us and offset by deferred tax charges related to changes in assessment regarding the permanent reinvestment of certain foreign earnings 

consolidated results – year ended december 31 2012  compared with year ended december 31 2011   

net sales decreased   345 million  or 51  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the same period in 2011  primarily due to lower pricing in our acetyl intermediates segment and unfavorable currency impacts across all our segments except consumer specialties due to the stronger us dollar against the euro although acetyl intermediates volumes remained flat compared to the prior year acetic acid pricing declined compared to 2011 as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions in europe and asia also in 2011 temporarily elevated industry utilization due to planned and unplanned outages of acetyl products resulted in higher industry pricing 

selling general and administrative expenses increased   25 million  or 31  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the same period in 2011  primarily due to an increase in our actuarial loss on our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans of 54 million as compared to the prior year partially offset by a reduction in business and functional optimization initiatives and other productivity spending

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2013  we have 600 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and 18 million  available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2014  if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

on may 15 2013 together with mitsui  co ltd of tokyo japan mitsui we announced that we had signed an agreement to establish a joint venture for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in clear lake texas the planned methanol unit will utilize natural gas in the us gulf coast region as a feedstock and will benefit from the existing infrastructure at our clear lake facility as a result the total shared capital and expense investment in the facility is estimated to be 800 million our portion of the investment is estimated to be 300 million in addition to previously invested assets at our clear lake facility the planned methanol unit will have an annual capacity of 13 million  tons and is expected to be operational in the second half of 2015 

as a result of the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters boiler mact regulations discussed in item 1a risk factors  we are required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for industrial boilers and process heaters at our narrows virginia cellulose derivatives facility in october 2012 we received approval to proceed with replacing the coalfired boilers at our narrows virginia site with new natural gasfired boilers and construction began during the first half of 2013 we anticipate the project will be completed in mid2015 our total investment is estimated at over 150 million 

total cash outflows for capital expenditures including the specific projects above are expected to be in the range of 450 million  to 500 million  in 2014  due to the construction of the clear lake methanol unit and conversion of our coal to gas boilers at our cellulose derivatives plant in narrows virginia the expected 2014  total cash outflows for capital expenditures includes our portion of the investment in the planned methanol unit at our clear lake texas plant 

as a result of the roussillon acetic anhydride facility closure and the tarragona vam facility closure we recorded personnelrelated exit costs of 20 million  contract termination costs of 33 million  other facility shutdown costs of 5 million  and 34 million  of noncash asset impairments during the three months ended december 31 2013 the related cash outflows will occur over a oneyear period 

on a standalone basis celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary celanese us holdings llc celanese us have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own accordingly they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese and celanese us in order to meet their obligations including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on celanese series a common stock 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2013  were 984 million  an increase  of 25 million from december 31 2012  as of december 31 2013  700 million  of the 984 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us with the possible exception of funds that have been previously subject to us federal and state taxation while we may repatriate cash from time to time our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2012  were 959 million  an increase of 277 million  from december 31 2011  

 50 

 cash flow provided by operating activities increased  by 40 million for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  with operating cash inflows increasing from 722 million  to 762 million  cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31 2013 increased primarily as a result of stronger earnings performance and a 192 million  reduction in pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan contributions made during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the prior year these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower dividends from our equity investments higher cash taxes paid and a less favorable change in trade working capital the 121 million  decrease in dividends from our equity investments was primarily due to the absence of a 75 million cash dividend received from our polyplastics co ltd strategic affiliate in 2012 as a result of an amendment to our joint venture and other related agreements 

the less favorable impact of trade working capital on cash flow from operations is reflective of increases in trade receivables and inventories offset by increases in trade payables since december 31 2012 trade receivables increased due to higher net sales for the three months ended december 31 2013 compared to the three months ended december 31 2012 the increase in inventory levels was the result of strategic plant operating decisions and was consistent with the increase in trade payables due to the timing of invoice receipts and cash payments associated with raw material inventory 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased  by 84 million for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011 the increase in cash provided by operations was positively impacted by the decrease in trade working capital which was primarily due to the decrease in trade receivables trade receivables decreased primarily due to lower net sales during the three months ended december 31 2012 compared to the three months ended december 31 2011 the increase in cash provided by operations was also impacted by lower cash taxes paid of 30 million  lower cash interest paid of 37 million  offset by higher pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan contributions of 79 million  made during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year 

trade working capital is calculated as follows 

 net cash used in investing activities was 422 million  and 500 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively cash outflows were primarily for capital expenditures of 370 million  and 361 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively excluding amounts related to the relocation and expansion of our polyacetal pom production facility in frankfurt hoechst industrial park germany capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily related to capacity expansions major investments to reduce future operating costs and improve plant reliability and environmental and health and safety initiatives capital expenditures relating to the relocation and expansion of our german pom operations amounted to 7 million  and 49 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively acquisitions net of cash acquired decreased by 23 million  with no acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013  in 2012 we acquired certain assets from ashland inc

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include our engineered materials cellulose derivatives food ingredients emulsion polymers eva polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount after assessing qualitative factors if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative assessment is not required if an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangible asset a quantitative analysis will be performed we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances 

in performing a quantitative analysis recoverability of goodwill is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates tax rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the 

 58 

recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss is recorded to write down the carrying amount an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests other indefinitelived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates tax rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

in connection with our annual indefinitelived intangible assets impairment assessment we recorded an impairment loss of 1 million  in other charges gains net during the nine months ended september 30 2013  to writeoff the total net book value of a trademark included in the industrial specialties segment other than this trademark the estimated fair value for each of our other indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded the carrying amount of the underlying asset by a substantial margin 

for all significant goodwill the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying amount of the asset by a substantial margin at the date of the most recent impairment test 

no events or changes in circumstances occurred during the three months ended december 31 2013  that would indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable accordingly no additional impairment analysis was performed during that period 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 59 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if needed based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax planning strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg france spain china the united kingdom and canada we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

 we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements during 2013 we settled certain of our defined benefit pension plan obligations in the united kingdom and canada additionally pension benefits offered to all us nonunion participants in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan have been frozen and the plan was closed to new participants effective december 31 2013 

with respect to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the pension protection act of 2006 various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our net periodic benefit cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2013  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us defined benefit pension plans which represent approximately 88  and 86  of our fair value of pension plan assets and projected benefit obligation respectively on average the actual return on the us qualified defined pension plans assets over the longterm 20 years has exceeded 85 

another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2013  we increased the discount rate to 47  from 38  as of december 31 2012  for the us plans 

 60 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense 

on november 5 2013 we announced we would eliminate eligibility for all us nonunion individuals to our us postretirement health care plan and terminate this plan for all us nonunion participants effective december 31 2014 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook actuarial gains and losses generated by changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in net periodic benefit cost annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured 

we determine the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested a single longterm expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the longterm expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets are recognized in net periodic benefit cost annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured 

the estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2014  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business relating to and including product liability intellectual property land disputes commercial contracts employment antitrust workers compensation chemical exposure asbestos exposure prior acquisitions and divestitures past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience with respect to environmental remediation liabilities it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  fasb asc topic 815 

see note 21  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk management 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate borrowings we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate obligation a portion of these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

our usdollar interest rate swap derivative arrangements are as follows 

 

 upon issuance of the 4625  notes and 400 million  paydown of the term c loan facility in november 2012 we dedesignated as cash flow hedges a notional value of 395 million  of the 11 billion  notional value usdollar interest rate swap agreements expiring january 2 2014 and a loss of 6 million  was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net into interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended december 31 2012 future marktomarket adjustments on these dedesignated interest rate swap agreements were recorded in interest expense through their expiration on january 2 2014 see note 13  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2013  we had 790 million  €192 million  and cny470 million  of variable rate debt and outstanding usdollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 11 billion  that expire january 2 2014 and additional usdollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 500 million  that are in effect january 2 2014 and expire january 2 2016 these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the usdollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 6 million  

 62 

foreign exchange risk management 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted transactions forward contracts are not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic 815 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to short long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency all of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables receivables intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

commodity risk management 

we have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement of certain raw materials we manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase agreements we regularly assess our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity requirements under forward purchase agreements and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in market conditions forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity for qualifying contracts we have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of fasb asc topic 815 based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that we would not settle net and the transaction would settle by physical delivery of the commodity as such realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract

the approximate number of employees employed by celanese on a continuing basis throughout the world is as follows 

backlog 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance

 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have significant operations 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in ventures that operate in the us germany china japan malaysia south korea taiwan and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices also our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and 

expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

in addition to the worldwide economic downturn conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere 

failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states canadian mexican german european union eu or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth may slow and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe europe has historically accounted for over onethird of our net revenues and more than 40 in 2012 the european sovereign debt crisis and bank funding pressures in the eurozone may continue to negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth and resulting decreased enduse customer demand 

as of december 31 2012 we held 189 million in cash in europe this cash is primarily invested in deposits in several european banks a european money market fund that invests only in highly rated and liquid european sovereign debt and a us treasury money market fund the allocation of the cash invested in each of these options fluctuates based on market conditions as of december 31 2012 we also had 75 million of direct investments in highly rated european sovereign debt in our pension funds accounting for less than 3 of our total pension fund assets that may be affected if european economic conditions worsen finally our ability to access additional liquidity from european financial institutions in the future may also be impaired 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results 

we purchase significant amounts of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vae and eva production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of natural disasters plant or production disruptions strikes or other labor unrest war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities or changes in laws or regulations in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse financial results 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of ethylene methanol carbon monoxide wood pulp natural gas electricity and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile in addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs or if such commodities become unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products with a resulting reduction in our margins and financial results 

a portion of our supply of methanol in north america is currently obtained under a contract expiring in 2015 if we are unable to obtain a reliable source of supply prior to expiration of the contract we will likely purchase methanol on the open market we currently plan to construct a methanol plant in the us to partially replace the methanol obtained under that contract 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes or other labor unrest transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operation to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies free of any legal restrictions if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected for example we recently announced our intention to construct new ethanol manufacturing facilities in china and the us that will utilize advanced technology developed with elements of our proprietary advanced acetyl platform however as we invest in the commercialization of this new process technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners   participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control the industries in which these customers 

participate are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products the consequences of this could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition furthermore the continuing european sovereign debt crisis could increase the likelihood and impact of these events for our european customers by potentially limiting enduse customer demand and restricting our customers access to capital which could continue to negatively affect our financial results 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture transport use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present 

one example of such regulations is the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters boiler mact which was published by the environmental protection agency epa in the federal register on march 21 2011 epa issued a revised final rule on december 20 2012 the boiler mact regulation will require us to make significant capital expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for industrial boilers and process heaters at our facilities in the next three to four years consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products 

in june 2009 the california office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha formally proposed to add vam along with 11 other substances to a list of chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer oehha is required to maintain this list under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 proposition 65 celanese successfully defeated the attempt to list vam through a judicial challenge that is now final and oehha has withdrawn vam from its list of proposed chemicals for the proposition 65 list however oehha initially proposed vam to the proposition 65 list as a result of a lawsuit by an environmental group activists may again seek to require oehha to consider listing vam or other chemicals on the proposition 65 list in addition vam or other chemicals we produce may be classified in other jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer iarc a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in october 2009 iarc also concluded based on a recent study that there is sufficient evidence for a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia we expect the results of iarcs review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act tsca in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

regulations are being implemented by the us department of homeland security dhs aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and security plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we have registered certain of our sites with dhs in accordance with these regulations have conducted vulnerability assessments at applicable sites and are awaiting dhs review and approval of security plans until that is done we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu the epa has promulgated rules concerning greenhouse gas emissions in addition regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation 

while not all are likely to become law many countries are considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food beverage cigarette automobile medical device and pharmaceutical industries involve a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition although we have standard contracting policies and controls we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings below 

changes in tax legislation throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world in particular proposed us tax legislation could materially impact our results currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain proposals could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 7550  employees approximately 19  of our 2750  us based employees are unionized our two us based collective bargaining agreements expire in 2014 and 2016 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives and the chances are low a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future   acquisitions into our business which could affect adversely our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe that we anticipate or at all which could affect adversely our business or results of operations 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

because we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies unless we have cash flows in those foreign currencies from our foreign operations to repay such indebtedness 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective in addition the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

we attach importance to our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets in order to protect our investment in research and development and competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing of our products we have also adopted internal policies for protecting our valuable knowhow and trade secrets we sometimes license patents and other technology from third parties our practice is to seek protection for significant developments that provide us competitive 

advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed throughout the world and provide varying periods and scope of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protections provided by patents may vary between countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes and products described and claimed in those patents may become generally available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and will continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers 

the insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in the future there can be no assurance that the types of insurance we obtain or the level of coverage we maintain is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all 

differences in views with our joint venture participants may cause our joint ventures not to operate according to their business plans which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans or to fail to achieve their desired operating performance our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

our total indebtedness is 31 billion  as of december 31 2012  see note 13  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the senior credit agreement and the indentures governing the 600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due 2018 the 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2021 and the 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior notes due 2022 together the notes limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the notes would increase 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase as of december 31 2012  we had 781 million  €214 million  and cny680 million  of variable rate debt and outstanding usdollar interest rate swap agreements with a 

notional value of 11 billion  that expire january 2 2014 these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the usdollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 1 million  

on february 1 2012 we executed forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 500 million which are effective january 2 2014 through january 2 2016 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 21  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness 

the senior credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the indentures governing the notes limit celanese uss and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional debt pay dividends or make other restricted payments consummate specified asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to celanese us and its restricted subsidiaries merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

in addition the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us having to obtain the consent of holders of the notes and of our lenders in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the senior credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the senior credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if we were unable to repay or refinance such indebtedness the lenders under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the senior credit agreement if the lenders under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the notes by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the notes and the guarantee of the celanese uss obligations under the notes by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable country or state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries ability to distribute cash to celanese us and celanese while the indentures governing the notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to put restrictions on paying dividends or making other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the notes the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the notes by celanese or our other indebtedness

selected data by business segment 

factors affecting business segment net sales 

the percentage increase decrease in net sales attributable to each of the factors indicated for each of our business segments is as follows 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

 

1 2011  includes the effects of the two product lines acquired in may 2010 from dupont performance polymers 

consolidated results – year ended december 31 2012  compared with year ended december 31 2011   

net sales decreased   345 million  in 2012  from 2011  primarily due to lower pricing in our acetyl intermediates segment and unfavorable currency impacts across all our segments except consumer specialties due to the stronger us dollar against the euro although acetyl intermediates volumes remained flat compared to the prior year acetic acid pricing declined compared to 2011 as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions in europe and asia also in 2011  temporarily elevated industry utilization due to planned and unplanned outages of acetyl products resulted in higher industry pricing 

operating profit decreased   179 million  from the prior year primarily due to lower pricing in our acetyl intermediates segment and unfavorable currency impacts lower other charges gains net and selling general and administrative expenses on a consolidated basis were not sufficient to offset the pricing and currency impacts operating profit as a percentage of sales in 2012  decreased to 80  from 102  in 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased   29 million  in 2012  primarily due to a reduction in business and functional optimization initiatives and other productivity spending as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 79  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  

other charges gains net changed 34 million  during 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to lower expenses related to the relocation of our german polyacetal pom operations to the frankfurt hoechst industrial park in germany during the year ended december 31 2012  and 2011  we recorded 7 million  and 47 million  of relocation expenses respectively additionally we recorded 8 million  of employee termination benefits during the year ended december 31 2011  related to the relocation of our german pom plant no additional employee termination benefits were recorded in 2012 see note 27  plant relocation  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the pom plant relocation the german pom operations are included in our advanced engineered materials segment 

during the year ended december 31 2011  we received consideration of 17 million  in connection with the settlement of a claim against a bankrupt supplier the resolution of this commercial dispute is included in our acetyl intermediates segment 

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 50 million  in 2012  compared to the prior year primarily due to 18 million  in higher earnings in our ibn sina affiliate and 13 million  in our polyplastics affiliate both included in our advanced engineered materials segment during the year ended december 31 2012  a subsidiary of our infraserv hoechst affiliate restructured its debt resulting in additional net earnings of affiliates of 22 million  of which 3 million  was attributable to our consumer specialties segment 6 million  to our acetyl intermediates segment and 13 million  to other activities 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012  was 7  compared to 20  for the year ended december 31 2011  the effective tax rate for 2012 was favorably impacted by foreign tax credit carryforwards realized in the us during the three months ended march 31 2012 and offset by deferred tax charges related to changes in assessment regarding the permanent reinvestment of certain foreign earnings 

consolidated results  year ended december 31 2011  compared with year ended december 31 2010   

net sales increased   845 million  in 2011  from 2010  primarily due to higher pricing across all of our business segments favorable foreign currency impacts due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro also added to the increase in net sales in addition to higher pricing our advanced engineered materials segment contributed to our increase in net sales reflecting the impact of the two product lines zenite ®  liquid crystal polymers lcp and thermx ®  polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate pct acquired in may 2010 as well as higher volumes in almost all of its product lines particularly in longfiber reinforced thermoplastics lft and gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene increased net sales also were a result of strong global demand and higher innovation volumes from our emulsions business volumes in our consumer specialties segment remained relatively flat while volumes in our acetyl intermediates segment decreased primarily due to planned and unplanned production outages at our nanjing facility and industry destocking across the supply chain at the end of the year 

operating profit increased   187 million  from the prior year due to higher net sales primarily in our acetyl intermediates segment which more than offset the increase in raw materials other variable costs and selling general and administrative expenses operating profit also increased due to the absence of certain writeoffs and accelerated amortization recorded in 2010 during the year ended december 31 2010  we wroteoff other productive assets of 18 million  related to our singapore and nanjing china facilities which are included in our acetyl intermediates segment we also recorded 22 million of accelerated amortization to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy in 2009 the accelerated amortization was recorded as 20 million  to our acetyl intermediates segment and 2 million to our advanced engineered materials segment both the writeoff of other productive assets and accelerated amortization were recorded to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31 2010  

selling general and administrative expenses increased   31 million  in 2011 primarily due to costs associated with business and functional optimization initiatives and higher spending on innovation however as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses declined from 85  to 79  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010 due to sustainable efficiencies 

other charges gains net changed 2 million  during 2011  as compared to 2010  primarily due to a decrease in asset impairments and employee termination benefits offset by an increase in plant relocation costs a decrease in insurance recoveries and the absence of reductions in legal reserves 

during 2010 we concluded that certain longlived assets were partially impaired at our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in spondon derby united kingdom accordingly we wrote down the related property plant and equipment to its fair value of 31 million  resulting in longlived asset impairment losses of 72 million  the spondon derby united kingdom operations are included in our consumer specialties segment 

employee termination benefits decreased 10 million  compared to prior year primarily due to lower severance costs associated with the planned closure of our spondon derby united kingdom facility and our project of closure at our pardies france operations offset by additional severance costs related to our kelsterbach plant relocation the pardies france operations are included in our acetyl intermediates segment see note 4 acquisitions  dispositions ventures and plant closures  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these plant closures we recorded 8 million  of employee termination benefits during the year ended december 31 2011  related to the relocation of our pom kelsterbach germany operations to the frankfurt hoechst industrial park germany on september 26 2011 we announced the startup of the new pom production facility in the frankfurt hoechst industrial park 

during the year ended december 31 2011  we received consideration of 17 million  in connection with the settlement of a claim against a bankrupt supplier the resolution of this commercial dispute is included in the acetyl intermediates segment 

other charges gains net for the year ended december 31 2011  and 2010 was partially offset by 6 million  and 59 million  respectively of recoveries and decreases in legal reserves associated with plumbing actions which are included in our advanced engineered materials segment 

as a result of certain events beginning in october 2008 and subsequent periodic cessation of production during 2009 we recorded 25 million  of insurance recoveries during the year ended december 31 2010 in our industrial specialties segment this amount was partially offset by a 7 million  charge from our captive insurance companies included in other activities 

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased during 2011 primarily due to higher earnings in our ibn sina affiliate included in our advanced engineered materials segment 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011  was 20  compared to 21  for the year ended december 31 2010 the effective tax rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by increased foreign tax credit benefits realized in the united states and changes in assessments regarding valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets partially offset by foreign losses not providing tax benefits the effective rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by amendments to tax legislation in mexico 

business segments – year ended december 31 2012  compared with year ended december 31 2011   

advanced engineered materials 

our advanced engineered materials segment develops produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty polymers for application in automotive medical and electronics products as well as other consumer and industrial applications together with our strategic affiliates our advanced engineered materials segment is a leading participant in the global specialty polymers industry the primary products of advanced engineered materials are polyoxymethylene also commonly known as polyacetal pom lft polybutylene terephthalate pbt gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and lcp pom lft and pbt are used in a broad range of products including automotive components medical devices electronics appliances and industrial applications gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene is used in battery separators conveyor belts filtration equipment coatings and medical devices primary end uses for lcp are electrical and electronics applications or products polyphenylene sulfide pps sold under the fortron ®  brand is a key product of fortron industries llc one of our strategic affiliates pps is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications especially those requiring heat andor chemical resistance 

advanced engineered materials’ net sales decreased   37 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the weak economic conditions in europe particularly impacting demand for automotive and industrial applications in this region partially offset by increased volumes in automotive 

applications in the americas the weak euro had an unfavorable currency impact on net sales 2  higher average pricing across most product lines partially offset the lower volumes and unfavorable currency impacts 

operating profit increased   10 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the same period in 2011  primarily due to a change in other charges gains net of 47 million  primarily associated with the relocation and expansion of our kelsterbach germany pom production operations which more than offset the higher depreciation of 13 million  mainly related to the new pom production facility in frankfurt hoechst industrial park increased pricing resulted in expanded margins which partially offset lower volumes unfavorable currency impacts and higher expenses of 28 million primarily related to plant maintenance integrating manufacturing operations from recently acquired product lines and investing in our compounding operations in asia 

for the year ended december 31 2012  equity in net earnings loss of affiliates increased 29 million  primarily due to an 18 million  increase in earnings in our ibn sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs used in our specialty polymer operations the increase in ibn sina earnings was primarily driven by higher pricing of methanol and methyl tertiarybutyl ether operating and financial results of our polyplastics affiliate for the year ended december 31 2011 were modestly impacted by the march 2011 natural disasters in japan and a plant turnaround during the three months ended december 31 2011  no such events occurred in 2012  with earnings in our polyplastics affiliate up 13 million  over 2011  

consumer specialties 

our consumer specialties segment includes our acetate products and nutrinova businesses which serve consumerdriven applications our acetate products business is a leading producer and supplier of acetate flake acetate film and acetate tow primarily used in filter products applications our nutrinova business is a leading international supplier of premium quality ingredients for the food beverage and pharmaceuticals industries nutrinova produces and sells sunett ®  high intensity sweeteners and is one of the worlds largest producers of food protection ingredients such as potassium sorbates and sorbic acid 

net sales for consumer specialties increased   25 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the same period in 2011  due to 6 higher acetate products pricing which more than offset the decline in volumes volumes declined for acetate products primarily due to actions taken to accommodate the november 2012 shutdown of our acetate tow and flake manufacturing operations at our spondon derby united kingdom site nutrinova net sales remained flat over prior year 

operating profit increased   17 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared with the same period in 2011  as higher pricing more than offset lower volumes and 24 million in higher plant maintenance and energy costs plant maintenance costs included 10 million of increased spending related to a temporary production outage during the three months ended march 31 2012 

other charges gains net changed 1 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  primarily due to recording insurance recoveries of 9 million  related to an electrical disruption in 2010 at our acetate products manufacturing facility in narrows 

virginia offset by 8 million  of longlived asset impairment losses related to the previously announced closure of our spondon derby united kingdom facility the insurance recoveries were offset in our captive insurance companies included in other activities 

industrial specialties 

our industrial specialties segment includes our emulsions and eva performance polymers businesses our emulsions business is a leading global producer of vinyl acetatebased emulsions and develops products and application technologies to improve performance create value and drive innovation in applications such as paints and coatings adhesives construction glass fiber textiles and paper our emulsions products are sold under globally and regionally recognized brands including ecovae ®  mowilith ®  vinamul ®  celvolit ®  britecoat ®  tufcor tm  and avicor tm  eva performance polymers is a leading north american manufacturer of a full range of lowdensity polyethylene and specialty ethylene vinyl acetate eva resins and compounds sold under the ateva ®  and vitaldose ®  brands these products are used in many applications including flexible packaging films lamination film products hot melt adhesives medical products automotive carpeting and photovoltaic cells 

net sales decreased  in industrial specialties 39 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  volumes increased reflecting the increased demand in north america and asia for our emulsions applications but were not sufficient to offset the impacts of lower pricing and unfavorable currency mostly due to the stronger dollar against the euro lower pricing was primarily driven by lower raw material costs a shift in product mix in our emulsions business and a soft global demand for photovoltaic applications 

operating profit decreased   18 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the decrease in operating profit is attributed to the 3  lower average pricing partially offset by higher volumes as well as lower raw material costs of 34 million primarily related to ethylene and vinyl acetate monomer vam depreciation and amortization increased 10 million  compared to prior year primarily due to increased amortization in our emulsions business related to the recent acquisition of finitelived intangible assets and increased depreciation related to the china vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions vae capacity expansion 

acetyl intermediates

the operating loss for other activities decreased   7 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  primarily due to lower selling general and administrative expenses and other charges gains net selling general and administrative expenses decreased 13 million primarily due to lower shared services costs stockbased compensation costs and lower legal claims slightly offset by strategic growth initiatives other charges gains net changed 4 

million  due to the resolution of a commercial dispute and the absence of insurance recovery payments offsetting these lower costs was the absence of the 14 million gain on the sale of an office building in 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2012  we have 108 million  available for borrowing under our creditlinked revolving facility and 600 million available under our revolving credit facility to assist in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations if required 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2013  if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

as a result of the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters boiler mact regulations discussed in item 1a risk factors  we will be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for industrial boilers and process heaters at our facilities in the next three to four years in october 2012 we received approval to proceed with replacing the coalfired boilers at our narrows virginia site with new natural gasfired boilers our total investment is estimated at over 150 million upon approval of construction permits we anticipate construction will begin in early 2013 with completion approximately 2 years later

market risks 

please see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2  summary of accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include advanced engineered materials acetate products nutrinova emulsions celanese eva performance polymers and acetyl intermediates businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value 

the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates the companys theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

for all significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying value of the asset by a substantial margin at the date of the most recent impairment test 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to the companys assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if needed based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax planning strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg france spain china the united kingdom and canada we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 

we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

 we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the pension protection act of 2006 various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our net periodic benefit cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2012  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us defined benefit pension plans which represent approximately 83  and 84  of our fair value of pension plan assets and projected benefit obligation respectively on average the actual return on the us qualified defined pension plans assets over the longterm 20 years has exceeded 85 

another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2012  we decreased the discount rate to 38  from 46  as of december 31 2011  for the us plans 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook we determine the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested a single longterm expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the longterm expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan 

differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets are generally not recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the year that the difference occurs these differences are deferred and amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining future service of employees we apply the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets to a marketrelated value of plan assets to stabilize variability in the plan asset values 

the estimated increases in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs that would occur in 2013  from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows 

 

 we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business relating to and including product liability intellectual property land disputes commercial contracts employment antitrust workers compensation chemical exposure asbestos exposure prior acquisitions and divestitures past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience with respect to environmental remediation liabilities it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 450 contingencies and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  fasb asc topic 815 

see note 21  derivative financial instruments  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk management 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate borrowings we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate obligation a portion of these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

our usdollar interest rate swap derivative arrangements are as follows 

 

 upon issuance of the 4625  notes and 400 million  paydown of the term c loan facility on november 13 2012 it became probable that the hedged interest payments associated with 395 million  of our variable rate usdollar debt would not occur accordingly we dedesignated as cash flow hedges a notional value of 395 million  of the 11 billion  notional value usdollar interest rate swap agreements expiring january 2 2014 and a loss of 5 million  was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net into interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended december 31 2012 future marktomarket adjustments on these dedesignated interest rate swap agreements will be recorded in interest expense through their expiration on january 2 2014 see note 13  debt  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2012  we had 781 million  €214 million  and cny680 million  of variable rate debt and outstanding usdollar interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 11 billion  that expire january 2 2014 these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the usdollar variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 1 million  

foreign exchange risk management 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted transactions forward contracts are not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic 815 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to short long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency all of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables receivables intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

commodity risk management 

we have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement of certain raw materials we manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase agreements we regularly assess our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity requirements under forward purchase agreements and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in market conditions forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity for qualifying contracts we have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of fasb asc topic 815 based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that we would not settle net and the transaction would settle by physical delivery of the commodity as such realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract 

in addition we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy source typically these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting these instruments are marked to market at each reporting period and gains losses are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations we recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  as of december 31 2012  we did not have any open financial derivative contracts for commodities

strategic affiliates 

our strategic affiliates represent an important component of our strategy for accelerated growth and global expansion we have a substantial portfolio of ventures in various regions including asiapacific north america the middle east and europe these ventures some of which date back as far as the 1960s have sizeable operations and are significant within their industries 

our strategic affiliates have similar growth patterns and business models as our core businesses with shared characteristics such as products applications and manufacturing technology these strategic affiliates complement and extend our technology and specialty materials portfolio we have historically entered into these investments to gain access to local demand minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential depending on the level of investment and other factors we account for our strategic ventures using either the equity method or cost method of accounting 

our strategic affiliates contribute substantial sales earnings and cash flows during the year ended december 31 2011  our equity affiliates generated combined sales of 5 billion  resulting in celanese recording 192 million  of equity in net earnings of affiliates in the accompanying financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  

our key strategic affiliates   as of december 31 2011  are as follows 

national methanol company ibn sina founded in 1981 national methanol company represents approximately 2 of the worlds methanol production capacity and is one of the worlds largest producers of methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe a gasoline additive its production facilities are located in saudi arabia we indirectly own a 25 interest in ibn sina through cte petrochemicals company a 5050 joint venture with texas eastern arabian corporation ltd which also indirectly owns a 25 interest the remaining 50 interest in ibn sina is held by the saudi basic industries corporation “sabic” sabic is responsible for all product marketing because methanol is a key feedstock for pom production we enjoy an advantaged position through our ibn sina venture that mitigates the impact of raw material and energy volatility 

in april 2010 we announced that the term of the ibn sina agreement was extended until 2032 and that the joint venture will construct a 50000 ton pom production facility in saudi arabia the new facility will supply pom to support advanced engineered materials accelerated future growth plans as well as our venture partners regional business development upon successful startup of the pom facility our indirect economic interest in ibn sina will increase from 25 to 325 sabics economic interest will remain unchanged 

korea engineering plastics co ltd   founded in 1987 kepco is the leading producer of pom in south korea kepco is a venture between celaneses ticona business 50 mitsubishi gas chemical company inc 40 and mitsubishi corporation 10 kepco has polyacetal production facilities in ulsan south korea compounding facilities for pbt and nylon in pyongtaek south korea and participates with polyplastics and mitsubishi gas chemical company inc in a worldscale pom facility in nantong china 

polyplastics co ltd   polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineered plastics in the asiapacific region and is a venture between daicel chemical industries ltd japan 55 and celaneses ticona business 45 established in 1964 polyplastics is a producer and marketer of pom and lcp in the asiapacific region with principal production facilities located in japan taiwan malaysia and china 

fortron industries llc fortron is a leading global producer of polyphenylene sulfide “pps” sold under the fortron ®  brand which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications especially those requiring heat andor chemical resistance established in 1992 fortron is a limited liability company whose members are ticona fortron inc 50 ownership and a whollyowned subsidiary of cna holdings llc and kureha corporation 50 ownership and a whollyowned subsidiary of kureha chemical industry co ltd of japan fortrons facility is located in wilmington north carolina this venture combines the sales marketing distribution compounding and manufacturing expertise of celanese with the pps polymer technology expertise of kureha 

china acetate strategic ventures we hold an approximate 30 ownership interest in three separate acetate production ventures in china these include the nantong cellulose fibers co ltd kunming cellulose fibers co ltd and zhuhai cellulose fibers co ltd the china national tobacco corporation the chinese stateowned tobacco entity controls the remaining ownership interest in each of these ventures 

with an estimated 30 share of the worlds cigarette production and consumption china is the worlds largest and fastest growing area for acetate tow products according to the 2009 stanford research institute international chemical economics handbook combined these ventures are a leader in chinese domestic acetate production and are well positioned to supply chinese cigarette producers 

in december 2009 we announced plans with china national tobacco to expand our acetate flake and tow capacity at our ventures nantong facility and we received formal approval for the expansions each by 30000 tons during 2010 since their inception in 1986 the china acetate ventures have completed 12 expansions leading to earnings growth and increased dividends 

our chinese acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash flow during 2011 we made contributions of 8 million  related to the capacity expansions in nantong and have committed contributions of 9 million  in 2012 in 2010 we made contributions of 12 million  

our chinese acetate ventures pay a dividend in the second quarter of each fiscal year based on the ventures performance for the preceding year in 2011  2010  and 2009  we received cash dividends of 78 million 71 million and 56 million respectively 

although our ownership interest in each of our china acetate ventures exceeds 20 we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” 

 infraservs we hold indirect ownership interests in several infraserv groups in germany that own and develop industrial parks and provide onsite general and administrative support to tenants the table below represents our equity investments in infraserv ventures as of december 31 2011  

raw materials and energy 

we purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and acetaldehyde although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier there cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as supply and demand fundamentals change our production facilities rely largely on fuel oil natural gas coal and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by one of our subsidiaries which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts 

we also currently purchase and lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the manufacture of acetyl intermediates products for precious metals the leases are distributed among a minimum of three lessors per product 

research and development 

our businesses are innovationoriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications we consider the amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be sufficient to execute our current strategic initiatives 

intellectual property 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing patents may cover processes products intermediate products and product uses we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products we protect our intellectual property vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate 

patents  in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor competitive developments and vigorously defend against infringements on our intellectual property rights

employees 

the approximate number of employees employed by celanese on a continuing basis throughout the world is as follows 

backlog 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

available information — securities and exchange commission “sec” filings and corporate governance materials 

we make available free of charge through our internet website httpwwwcelanesecom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as well as ownership reports on form 3 and form 4 as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with or furnishing it to the sec the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers including celanese corporation that electronically file with the sec at httpwwwsecgov 

we also make available free of charge through our internet website our corporate governance guidelines of our board of directors and the charters of each of the committees of the board 




 item 1a   risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results   of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic   environmental political industry business financial and regulatory conditions the factors   described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our business 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general   economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we   have significant operations 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries our major facilities are primarily located in north america europe and asia and we hold interests in ventures that operate in the us germany china japan malaysia south korea taiwan and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices also our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and 

regulatory conditions 

in addition to the worldwide economic downturn conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather natural disasters the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate or have significant customers or suppliers could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere 

failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states canadian mexican german european union “eu” or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock although we maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the operation of our business there can be no assurance that the types of insurance we obtain or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this regions growth has slowed and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

in addition we have significant operations and financial relationships based in europe europe has historically accounted for over onethird of our net revenues if not resolved amicably and in a timely manner an extension or exacerbation of the european sovereign debt crisis may continue to negatively impact our overall financial results due to decreased enduse customer demand and the tightening of european credit markets that some of our customers rely on for funding as of december 31 2011 we held 180 million in cash in european banks this cash is primarily invested in deposits in several european banks a european money market fund which invests only in highly rated and liquid european sovereign debt and a us treasury money market fund the allocation of the cash invested in each of these options fluctuates based on market conditions as of december 31 2011 we also had 68 million of direct investments in highly rated european sovereign debt in our pension funds accounting for less than 3 of our total pension fund assets that may be affected if european economic conditions worsen finally our ability to access additional liquidity from european financial institutions in the future may also be impaired 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and   availability of key raw materials and energy 

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene carbon monoxide and methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of downstream products in all our business segments we also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our industrial specialties segment primarily for vae and eva production as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in our consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of that item and may increase significantly as a result of production disruptions or strikes in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide can have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene carbon monoxide wood pulp electricity and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

• shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand eg from growing uses or new uses 

• capacity constraints eg due to construction delays labor disruption or involuntary shutdowns 

• the general level of business and economic activity and 

• the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs or if such commodities were unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of   reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our   sales and satisfy our customers demands 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation political unrest or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operation to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement   productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive   position 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as process technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected for example we recently announced our intention to construct new ethanol manufacturing facilities in china and the us that will utilize advanced technology developed with elements of our proprietary advanced acetyl platform however as we invest in the commercialization of this new process technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals the development of competing technologies failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of financing required materials or equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our   suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers customers and business partners    participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect   our business and results of operations 

some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control the industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers products the consequences of this could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition furthermore the continuing european sovereign debt crisis could increase the likelihood and impact of these events for our european customers by potentially limiting enduse customer demand and restricting our customers access to capital which could continue to negatively affect our financial results 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters   could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require   us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing   and delivery costs 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us may have a significant negative impact on our operating results we also have 

obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture transport use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present 

one example of such regulations is the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters “boiler mact” which was published by the environmental protection agency “epa” in the federal register on march 21 2011 on may 16 2011 the epa administratively stayed the boiler mact regulation pending resolution of legal petitions and the epas reconsideration of portions of the final rule that stay was vacated by a federal court on january 9 2012 in the interim the epa signed the reproposed reconsidered boiler mact regulation on december 2 2011 and plans to have a final signed rule later in 2012 the boiler mact regulation will require us to make significant capital expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for industrial boilers and process heaters at our facilities in the next two to four years consequently compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we   manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our   products   

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products 

in june 2009 the california office of environmental health hazard assessment “oehha” formally proposed to add vam along with 11 other substances to a list of chemicals “known to the state of california” to cause cancer oehha is required to maintain this list under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 “proposition 65” celanese filed comments in opposition to the proposed listing because the listing was not based on a scientific review of the relevant data and the legal standard for adding vam to the proposition 65 list had not been met celanese also filed an action in the sacramento county superior court seeking declaration that oehhas proposed listing of vam would be contrary to law the sacramento county superior court granted celaneses request for relief an appeal filed by oehha is pending in the california court of appeal 

we can provide no assurance that the sacramento county superior court decision will be affirmed on appeal or that vam or other chemicals we produce will not be classified in other jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer “iarc” a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in october 2009 iarc also concluded based on a recent study that there is sufficient evidence for a causal association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia we expect the results of iarcs review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act “tsca” in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and 

otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production   plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future if passed   into law may increase   our operating costs and cause an adverse effect on our results of operations   

regulations are being implemented by the us department of homeland security “dhs” aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and security plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we have registered certain of our sites with dhs in accordance with these regulations have conducted vulnerability assessments at applicable sites and are awaiting dhs review and approval of security plans until that is done we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation   regulation and international accords 

greenhouse gas emissions have become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu similarly numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress which could adversely impact all industries in addition the epa has promulgated rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions and regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation 

while not all are likely to become law many countries are considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which   could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

the development manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food beverage cigarette automobile medical device and pharmaceutical industries involve a risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert managements attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous   materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our   operating results 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and   regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance 

receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings below 

changes in tax legislation throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world in particular proposed us tax legislation could materially impact our results currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain proposals could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the   identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 7600 employees approximately 19 of our 2600  us based employees are unionized our two us based collective bargaining agreements expire in 2013 and 2014 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils andor unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment including potentially salaries and benefits they may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives and the chances are low a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees could occur resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future   acquisitions into our business which could affect adversely our business or results   of operations 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe that we anticipate or at all which could affect adversely our business or results of operations 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that   could adversely impact our profitability   

because we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies unless we have cash flows in those foreign currencies from our foreign operations sufficient to repay that indebtedness out of those cash flows 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to   pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations   the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations the combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates if the funded status of a pension plan declines we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual   property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our   ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

we attach great importance to our patents trademarks copyrights knowhow and trade secrets in order to protect our investment in research and development and competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing of our products we have also adopted rigorous internal policies for protecting our valuable knowhow and trade secrets we sometimes license patents and other technology from third parties our practice is to seek the widest possible protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents are usually filed widely around the world and provide varying periods and scope of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application the legal life and scope of protections provided by patents may vary between countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes and products described and claimed in those patents may become generally available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

we are subject to information technology security threats that could materially affect our business 

we have been and continue to be subject to advanced persistent information technology security threats while some unauthorized access to our information technology systems occurs we believe to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft misuse or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks could harm our competitive position cause operational disruption reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees customers or vendors confidential information we may incur liability as a result although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including monitoring of our systems and networks and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact the companys financial results 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any stockholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any stockholders rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to   fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the   chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our   indebtedness 

our total indebtedness is 30 billion  as of december 31 2011  see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 24 

 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase   the risks described above 

although covenants under the senior credit agreement and the indentures governing the 600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due 2018 and the 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2021 together the “notes” limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our debt described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the notes would increase 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause   our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating   results   

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase as of december 31 2011  we had 11 billion  €219 million  and cny10 billion  of variable rate debt and outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional values of 11 billion that expire january 2 2014 which are accounted for as cash flow hedges these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations which leaves 39 million  €219 million  and cny10 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 5 million  on february 1 2012 the company executed forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 500 million which are effective january 2 2014 through january 2 2016 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below and note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may   be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which   may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in   certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our   indebtedness 

the senior credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the indentures governing the notes limit celanese uss and certain of its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional debt pay dividends or make other restricted payments consummate specified asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to celanese us and its restricted subsidiaries merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese uss assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

in addition the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us having to obtain the consent of holders of the notes and of our lenders in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the senior credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the senior credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the senior credit agreement if the lenders under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy   their obligations under the notes and the guarantee of celanese uss obligations   under the notes by celanese 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese uss obligations including obligations under the notes and the guarantee of the celanese uss obligations under the notes by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit celanese uss and celaneses ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indentures governing the notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the notes the guarantee of celanese uss obligations under the notes by celanese or our other indebtedness

consolidated results – year ended december 31 2011  compared with year ended december 31 2010   

net sales increased in 2011  from 2010  primarily due to higher pricing across all of our business segments favorable foreign currency impacts also added to the increase in net sales in addition to higher pricing our advanced engineered materials segment contributed to our increase in net sales reflecting the impact of the two product lines zenite ®  lcp and thermx ®  pct acquired from dupont performance polymers in may 2010 as well as higher volumes in almost all of its product lines particularly in lft and gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene increased net sales also were a result of higher growth and innovation volumes from our emulsions business volumes in our consumer specialties business remained relatively flat while volumes in our acetyl intermediates segment decreased primarily due to planned and unplanned production outages at our nanjing facility 

gross profit increased from the prior year due to higher net sales and the absence of certain writeoffs and accelerated amortization recorded in 2010  during the year ended december 31 2010  we wroteoff other productive assets of 18 million  related to our singapore and nanjing china facilities which are included in our acetyl intermediates segment we also recorded 22 million  of accelerated amortization to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy in 2009 the accelerated amortization was recorded as 20 million  to our acetyl intermediates segment and 2 million  to our advanced engineered materials segment both the writeoff of other productive assets and accelerated amortization were recorded to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31 2010  gross profit as a percentage of sales in 2011  increased due to higher pricing which more than offset higher raw material costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2011  primarily due to costs associated with business and functional optimization initiatives and higher spending on innovation however as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses declined from 85 to 79 for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010  due to sustainable efficiencies 

other charges gains net increased   2 million  during 2011  as compared to 2010

other charges for the year ended december 31 2011  and 2010  was partially offset by 6 million  and 59 million  respectively of recoveries and decreases in legal reserves associated with plumbing actions which are included in our advanced engineered materials business segment 

as a result of certain events beginning in october 2008 and subsequent periodic cessation of production during 2009 we recorded 25 million  of insurance recoveries during the year ended december 31 2010  in our industrial specialties segment this amount was partially offset by a 7 million  charge from our captive insurance companies included in our other activities segment 

during 2010  we concluded that certain longlived assets were partially impaired at our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in spondon derby united kingdom accordingly we wrote down the related property plant and equipment to its fair value of 31 million resulting in longlived asset impairment losses of 72 million  

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased during 2011  primarily due to higher earnings in our ibn sina affiliate in our advanced engineered materials segment 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011  was 20  compared to 21 for the year ended december 31 2010  the effective tax rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by increased foreign tax credit benefits realized in the united states and changes in assessments regarding valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets partially offset by foreign losses not providing tax benefits the effective rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by amendments to tax legislation in mexico 

consolidated results  year ended december 31 2010  compared with year ended december 31 2009   

during 2010  the global economy gradually began to recover from the challenging economic environment we experienced during the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 net sales increased in 2010  from 2009  primarily due to increased volumes as a result of the gradual recovery and increased selling prices across the majority of our business segments the increase in net sales resulting from our acquisition of fact in december 2009 only slightly offset the decrease in net sales due to the sale of our polyvinyl alcohol “pvoh” business in july 2009 within our industrial specialties segment unfavorable foreign currency impacts only slightly offset the increase in net sales 

gross profit increased due to higher net sales gross profit as a percentage of sales remained consistent with prior year as increased pricing offset increased raw material and energy costs 

in 2010  we wrote off 18 million  of other productive assets related to our asian facilities and recorded 22 million  in accelerated amortization to write off an asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed bankruptcy both of these costs were recorded to cost of sales during the year ended december 31 2010  

selling general and administrative expenses increased during 2010  primarily due to the increase in net sales and higher legal costs and costs associated with business optimization initiatives as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses declined slightly as compared to 2009  due to our continued fixed spending reduction efforts restructuring efficiencies and a positive impact from foreign currency 

other charges gains net decreased 90 million  during 2010  as compared to 2009  

during the year ended december 31 2010  we wrote down certain property plant and equipment at our spondon derby united kingdom facility to its fair value recording a 72 million  longlived asset impairment loss we also recorded in 2010   15 million  of employee termination benefits relating to the planned closure of this facility

business segments – year ended december 31 2011  compared with year ended december 31 2010   

advanced engineered materials 

our advanced engineered materials segment develops produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty polymers for application in automotive medical and electronics products as well as other consumer and industrial applicatio ns together with our strategic affiliates our advanced engineered materials segment is a leading participant in the global  specialty polymers industry the primary products of advanced engineered materials are polyoxymethylene also commonly known as polyacetal “pom” longfiber reinforced thermoplastics “lft” polybutylene terephthalate “pbt” polyethylene terephthalate “pet” gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene liquid crystal polymers “lcp” and polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate “pct” pom lft pbt pct and pet are used in a broad range of products including automotive components medical devices electronics appliances and industrial applications gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene is used in battery separators conveyor belts filtration equipment coatings and medical devices primary end uses for lcp are electrical and electronics 

advanced engineered materials’ net sales increased 189 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  the increase in net sales is primarily due to increases in average pricing for all products the impact of two product lines zenite ®  lcp and thermx ®  pct acquired from dupont performance polymers in may 2010 favorable currency impacts as well as higher volumes in almost all product lines particularly in lft and gur ® ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene 

operating profit decreased by 110 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010  mainly due to an increase in other charges related to the relocation of our pom production facility to frankfurt hoechst industrial park in addition aem experienced higher depreciation related to this new pom plant higher raw material costs and additional spending on innovation distribution energy costs and inflation other charges were higher than in the prior year reflecting the absence of a decrease in legal fees and recoveries associated with plumbing actions in 2010  as well as the higher costs incurred in 2011  associated with the relocation and expansion of our ticona kelsterbach germany pom production operations these higher costs were partially offset by our expanded gross margins and higher volumes 

for the year ended december 31 2011  an increase in equity in net earnings loss of affiliates partially offset the decrease in earnings loss from continuing operations before tax the increase in net earnings loss of affiliates was primarily driven by higher earnings in our ibn sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs used in our ticona operations and is constructing a 50000 ton pom production facility 

operating and financial results of our polyplastics strategic affiliate were modestly impacted by the march 2011 natural disasters in japan and a plant turnaround during the year ended december 31 2011  

consumer specialties 

our consumer specialties segment consists of our acetate products and nutrinova businesses our acetate products business produces and supplies cellulose acetate flake film and tow primarily used in filter products applications our nutrinova business produces and sells sunett ®  a high intensity sweetener and food protection ingredients such as sorbates and sorbic acid for the food beverage and pharmaceuticals industries 

net sales for consumer specialties increased 63 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010  acetate products pricing increased while volumes stayed relatively flat year over year nutrinovas volumes increased slightly reflecting higher demand and new applications for sunett ®  offsetting its decrease in pricing sorbates product price increases more than offset its slight decrease in volumes 

operating profit increased 63 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared with the same period in 2010  primarily due to the absence of the longlived asset impairment losses of 72 million  incurred in 2010  associated with management’s assessment of the closure of our acetate flake and tow production operations in spondon derby united kingdom higher raw material and energy costs and increased spending on planned maintenance and reliability efforts were offset by higher acetate pricing 

during the year ended december 31 2011  the company incurred an additional 4 million  in other charges relating to severance associated with the spondon shut down in 2010  other charges included the 72 million  for asset impairment losses 

industrial specialties 

our industrial specialties segment includes our emulsions and eva performance polymers businesses the emulsions business is a leading global producer of vinyl acetate based emulsions and develops products and application technology to improve performance create value and drive innovation in applications such as paints and coatings adhesives construction glass fiber textiles and paper celanese emulsions products are sold under globally and regionally recognized brands including ecovae ®  mowilith ®  vinamul ®  celvolit ®  britecoat tm  tufcor tm  and avicor tm  eva performance polymers the specialty polymers business of celanese is a leading north american manufacturer of a full range of lowdensity polyethylene and specialty eva resins and compounds sold under the ateva ®  and vitaldose tm  trade names these products are used in many applications including flexible packaging films lamination film products hot melt adhesives medical products automotive carpeting and photovoltaic cells 

net sales increased in our industrial specialties segment by 187 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  increased net sales were a result of geographic growth and higher volumes of innovative applications from our emulsions business favorable currency impact and higher pricing in both our emulsions and our eva performance polymers businesses 

operating profit increased by 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  the increase in operating profit is attributed to higher volumes and increased pricing offset by higher raw material costs increased spending on plant maintenance additional spending on innovation higher depreciation with the completion of our china facility expansion as well as the impact of an insurance recovery in 2010  related to events of force majeure at our eva performance polymers facility in edmonton alberta canada in 2008 and 2009 

acetyl intermediates 

our acetyl intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl products including acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer “vam” acetic anhydride and acetate esters these products are generally used as raw materials for colorants paints adhesives coatings textiles and medicines this business segment also produces organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical products 

net sales increased by 469 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  due to higher pricing and favorable foreign currency impacts offset partially by lower volumes volumes decreased primarily due to planned and unplanned outages at our nanjing facility and industry destocking at the end of the year favorable pricing for all major acetyl derivative product lines was achieved across all regions reflecting the recovery of higher raw material costs and a tight supply 

operating profit increased by 216 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  the increase in operating profit is primarily due to higher sales prices and favorable foreign currency impacts which more than offset the increase in raw material costs during the year ended december 31 2011  we also received consideration of 17 million  in connection with the settlement of a claim against a bankrupt supplier which was recorded to other charges the increase in operating profit also reflects the absence of closure costs of our acetic acid and vam production operations in pardies france which were incurred in 2010  

depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2011  was less than in the prior year in 2010  20 million  of accelerated amortization was recorded to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009 

other activities 

other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including financing and administrative activities and our captive insurance companies 

the operating loss for other activities decreased by 7 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  primarily due to lower selling general and administrative expenses and other charges selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower shared services costs stockbased compensation and lower legal claims slightly offset by strategic growth initiatives other charges were lower in 2011  compared to 2010  due to the absence of insurance recoveries 

business segment  year ended december 31 2010  compared with year ended   december 31 2009   

advanced engineered materials 

advanced engineered materials net sales increased 301 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  the increase in net sales is primarily related to significant increases in volume which are due to the gradual recovery in the global economy continued success in the innovation and commercialization of new products and applications and the acquisition of fact in december 2009 net sales was also positively impacted by increases in average pricing as a result of implemented price increases in addition to integrating the dupont product lines lcp and pct that were acquired in may 2010 into our sales process during the fourth quarter these increases were only partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

operating profit increased 148 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to the same period in 2009  the positive impact from higher sales volumes increased pricing for our high performance polymers and higher production volumes including a planned inventory build for the relocation of our facility in kelsterbach germany more than offset higher raw material and energy costs other charges positively impacted operating profit for the year ended december 31 2010  driven by a 45 million  decrease in legal reserves and 14 million  of recoveries associated with plumbing actions partially offset by expenses related to our european expansion and kelsterbach relocation depreciation and amortization includes 2 million  of accelerated amortization for the year ended december 31 2010  to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009  

earnings from continuing operations before tax increased for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to the same period in 2009  due to increased operating profit and increased equity in net earnings of affiliates our equity affiliates including ibn sina have experienced similar volume increases due to increased demand during the year ended december 31 2010  as a result our proportional share of net earnings of these affiliates increased 66 million for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  

consumer specialties 

net sales for consumer specialties increased 14 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in volume and price in our acetate products business more than offset the decline in volume and price in our nutrinova business as lower demand in sunett ®  negatively impacted net sales 

during the first half of 2010 we experienced a decline in net sales related to an electrical disruption and subsequent production outage at our acetate products manufacturing facility in narrows virginia the facility resumed normal operations during the second quarter of 2010 and we recovered the impacted volume during the second half of 2010 as we experienced increased volumes in our acetate products business due to higher demand in acetate tow and improved business in acetate film 

operating profit decreased for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to the same period in 2009  an increase in other charges for the year ended december 31 2010  had the most significant impact on operating profit as it was unfavorably impacted by longlived asset impairment losses of 72 million  associated with managements assessment of the closure of our acetate flake and tow production operations in spondon derby united kingdom during the three months ended march 31 2010 

during the year ended december 31 2010  earnings from continuing operations before tax decreased due to lower operating profit which was partially offset by higher dividends from our china ventures of 15 million compared to 2009  

industrial specialties 

net sales increased for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  increased net sales were a result of higher growth and innovation volumes from our emulsions business and higher volumes from our eva performance polymers business partially offset by impacts resulting from the sale of our pvoh business in july 2009 the increase in our eva performance polymers business volumes was partly as a result of our edmonton alberta canada plant being fully operational during 2010  volumes were lower during 2009  due to technical issues at our edmonton alberta canada plant such technical production issues were resolved and normal operations resumed prior to the end of the third quarter of 2009 higher prices in our eva performance polymers business due to price increases and favorable product mix were partially offset by lower prices in our emulsions business due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

in july 2009 we completed the sale of our pvoh business to sekisui chemical co ltd “sekisui” for a net cash purchase price of 168 million  excluding the value of accounts receivable and payable we retained the transaction resulted in a gain on disposition of 34 million  and includes longterm supply agreements between sekisui and celanese 

due to certain events in october 2008 and subsequent periodic cessations of production of our specialty polymers products produced at our eva performance polymers facility in edmonton alberta canada we declared two events of force majeure during 2009  we replaced longlived assets damaged in october 2008 as a result of these events and subsequent periodic cessation of production we recorded 25 million and 10 million of insurance recoveries to other charges during the years ended december 31 2010  and 2009  respectively these amounts were partially offset by 7 million and 10 million respectively recorded as a charge by our captive insurance companies included in the other activities segment the net insurance recoveries recorded during the year ended december 31 2010  of 18 million  consisted of 8 million related to property damage and 10 million related to business interruption 

operating profit remained unchanged for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  increases in operating profit in 2010  are primarily due to the resumption of normal operations at our eva performance polymers facility net insurance proceeds received in 2010  and increases in sales volumes and prices these increases were offset by the 2009 gain on disposition of assets related to the divestiture of our pvoh business and higher raw material costs in both our eva performance polymers and emulsions businesses 

acetyl intermediates 

our acetyl intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl products including acetic acid vam acetic anhydride and acetate esters these products are generally used as starting materials for colorants paints adhesives coatings textiles medicines and more other chemicals produced in this business segment are organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical products to meet the growing demand for acetic acid in china and to support ongoing site optimization efforts we successfully expanded our acetic acid unit in nanjing china from 600000 tons per reactor annually to 12 million tons per reactor annually during the fourth quarter of 2009 using new aoplus ® 2 capability the acetic acid unit could be further expanded to 15 million tons per reactor annually with only modest additional capital 

acetyl intermediates’ net sales increased 479 million  during the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to the same period in 2009  due to improvement in the global economy resulting in increased overall demand across all regions for the major acetyl derivative product lines increases in volume were also a direct result of our successful acetic acid expansion at our nanjing china plant we also experienced favorable pricing which was driven by rising raw material costs and price increases in acetic acid and vam across all regions the increase in net sales was only slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

operating profit increased during the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  the increase in operating profit is primarily due to higher volumes and prices and reduction in plant costs resulting from the closure of our less advantaged acetic acid and vam production operations in pardies france a decrease in other charges due primarily to the reduction of plant closure costs related to the 2009 closure of our pardies france facility also had a favorable impact on operating profit these increases to operating profit were only slightly offset by higher variable costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts higher variable costs were a direct result of price increases in all major raw materials depreciation and amortization includes 20 million  of accelerated amortization for the year ended december 31 2010  to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009  

earnings from continuing operations before tax increased during the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  due to increased operating profit 

other activities 

the operating loss for other activities increased 19 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  the increase was primarily due to a 38 million increase in selling general and administrative costs which was only partially offset by a 14 million gain on the sale of an office building higher selling general and administrative expenses were primarily due to higher legal costs and costs associated with business optimization initiatives 

the loss from continuing operations before tax increased 27 million for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  the increase is primarily related to 16 million of fees associated with our debt refinancing that occurred during the three months ended september 30 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2011  we have 154 million  available for borrowing under our creditlinked revolving facility and 600 million available under our revolving credit facility to assist in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations if required 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2012 if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

in january 2011 we signed letters of intent to construct and operate one and possibly two industrial ethanol production facilities in china the sites selected were nanjing china at the nanjing chemical industrial park and zhuhai china at the gaolan port economic zone we expect to begin industrial ethanol production within 30 months following project approvals with anticipated initial nameplate capacity of 400000 tons per year per unit and an initial investment of approximately 300 million per unit in june 2011 we announced our plans to accelerate our entry into the industrial ethanol business six to 12 months by modifying and enhancing our existing integrated acetyl facility at the nanjing chemical industrial park with our tcx ® advanced technology this would add approximately 200000 tons per year of ethanol production capacity by mid2013 

in june 2011 we broke ground on a technology development unit for ethanol production at our facility in clear lake texas which will be operational by mid2012 we also intend to construct a new research and development facility at our clear lake site to continue the advancement of our acetyl and tcx ®  technologies 

in april 2010 we announced that through our strategic affiliate ibn sina we will construct a 50000 ton pom production facility in saudi arabia our pro rata share of invested capital in the pom expansion is expected to total approximately 165 million over a four year period which began in late 2010 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we incurred 7 million and 2 million respectively of capital expenditures we anticipate related cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2012 will be 15 million to 20 million 

cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to range from 350 million to 400 million in 2012 excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach and capacity expansion in europe per the terms of our agreement with fraport we ceased pom operations at our kelsterbach germany facility prior to july 31 2011 accordingly we received the final cash installment of €110 million  in june 2011 as the relocation project progressed we expanded the scope of the new production facilities as a result we have spent in excess of total proceeds received from fraport on september 26 2011 the company announced the opening of the new pom production facility in frankfurt hoechst industrial park germany we anticipate related cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2012 will be €30 million 

in december 2009 we announced plans with china national tobacco corporation to expand the acetate flake and tow capacity at the venture’s nantong facility and in 2010 we received formal approval to expand flake and tow capacities each by 30000 tons our chinese acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash flow for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010 we contributed 8 million  and 12 million  respectively to the nantong expansion and expect to contribute an additional 9 million  in 2012 

as a result of the previously announced closure of our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations at the spondon derby united kingdom site we expect to record total expenses of 35 million to 45 million consisting of 20 million for personnelrelated exit costs and 20 million of other facilityrelated shutdown costs such as contract termination costs and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets we expect that substantially all of the exit costs except for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets of 15 million will result in future cash expenditures cash outflows are expected to occur into 2013 for the year ended december 31 2011  we recorded exit costs of 4 million  related to personnelrelated costs and  10 million  of other plant shutdown costs we expect the closure of the acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in spondon derby united kingdom to occur during 2012 see note 4 and note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

in addition to exitrelated costs associated with the closure of the spondon derby united kingdom acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations we expect to incur capital expenditures in certain capacity and efficiency improvements principally at our lanaken belgium facility to optimize our global production network for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010 

we incurred 26 million and 5 million respectively related to these capital projects and expect cash outflows of 13 million in 2012 related to the same projects 

as a result of the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters “boiler mact” regulations discussed in item 1a risk factors  we preliminarily estimate our costs in the us to exceed 100 million in total over the next four years depending on the timing and requirements of final signed rule 

on a standalone basis celanese has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries and no independent external operations of its own as such celanese generally will depend on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and their abilities to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese in order to meet its obligations including obligations under its series a common stock senior credit facilities and its senior notes 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2011  were 682 million  which is a change of 58 million from december 31 2010  as of december 31 2011  549 million of the 682 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us with the possible exception of funds that have been previously subject to us federal and state taxation our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2010 were 740 million which was a decrease of 514 million from december 31 2009 

 cash flow provided by operating activities increased by 186 million for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010  cash flow provided by operations was positively impacted by the increase in earnings from continuing operations as well as lower cash taxes the increase in cash provided by operations was partially offset by the impact of increases in trade working capital and higher pension contributions made during the year ended december 31 2011 than in the prior year 

cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased 144 million as compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in trade working capital and the increases in cash paid for taxes and legal settlements which negatively affected cash provided by operating activities more than offset the increase in earnings and the increase in cash from our foreign currency hedges 

 net cash used in investing activities decreased 119 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010  during the year ended december 31 2011 we received 158 million from fraport related to the relocation of our kelsterbach germany ticona operations no such proceeds were received during the same period in 2010 in addition in 2011 capital expenditures related to the relocation of our kelsterbach germany ticona operations were 108 million lower than in 2010 in 2011 we acquired a business primarily consisting of emulsions process technology from crown paints limited for 8 million while in 2010 we incurred 46 million related to our acquisition of two product lines zenite ®  lcp and thermx ®  pct from dupont performance polymers these decreases to cash used were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to property plant and equipment 

net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow of 31 million in 2009 to a cash outflow of 560 million for the same period in 2010 the decrease is primarily related to the receipt of proceeds of 412 million related to the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation and the receipt of 168 million for the sale of our pvoh business that were both received in 2009 there were no such proceeds in 2010 adding to the decrease was cash outflows of 46 million incurred in 2010 related to our acquisition of two product lines from dupont performance polymers as compared to the cash outflows for our fact business acquired in 2009 which were 8 million 

our cash outflows for capital expenditures were 349 million  201 million  and 176 million for the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009 respectively excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach capital expenditures were primarily related to major replacements of equipment capacity expansions major investments to reduce future operating costs and environmental and health and safety initiatives cash outflows for capital expenditures for our ticona kelsterbach plant relocation were 204 million 312 million and 351 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 net cash used in financing activities decreased 135 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  from a cash outflow of 388 million  in 2010  to a cash outflow of 253 million  in 2011  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily related to lower net borrowings and fewer stock repurchase transactions when compared to the same period in 2010 on may 6 2011 we completed an offering of 400 million of 5875 senior unsecured notes due 2021 the “5875 notes” we used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5875 notes and cash on hand to prepay the outstanding balance of 516 million on our term b loan facility 

net cash used in financing activities increased from a cash outflow of 112 million in 2009 to a cash outflow of 388 million for the same period in 2010 the 276 million increase primarily relates to the net pay down on longterm debt of 297 million and 48 million used to repurchase shares of the companys series a common stock 

in addition exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents was an unfavorable currency impact of 2 million in 2011 compared to a unfavorable impact of 18 million in 2010 and a favorable impact of 63 million in 2009 

debt and other obligations 

 in september 2010 celanese us completed an offering of 600 million aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior unsecured notes due 2018 in a private placement conducted pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” on april 14 2011 celanese us issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior unsecured notes the “6625 notes” in exchange for tendered 6625 senior unsecured notes issued under the private placement in an exchange offer registered under the securities act the 6625 notes have substantially identical terms as the notes issued under the private placement except the transfer restrictions registration rights and rights to increased interest in addition to the stated interest rate do not apply to the exchange notes the 6625 notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by celanese and each of the domestic subsidiaries of celanese us that guarantee its obligations under its senior secured credit facilities the “subsidiary guarantors”

the first supplemental indenture contains covenants including but not limited to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments engage in transactions with affiliates or engage in other businesses 

 in september 2010 we entered into an amendment agreement with the lenders under our existing senior secured credit facilities in order to amend and restate the corresponding credit agreement dated as of april 2 2007 as previously amended the “existing credit agreement” and as amended and restated by the amendment agreement the “amended credit agreement” our amended credit agreement consists of the term c loan facility having principal amounts of 1140 million of us dollardenominated and €204 million of eurodenominated term loans due 2016 the term b loan facility having principal amounts of 417 million us dollardenominated and €69 million of eurodenominated term loans due 2014 a 600 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2015 and a 228 million creditlinked revolving facility terminating in 2014

we are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of december 31 2011  

share capital 

we have a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of series a common stock par value 00001 per share on april 25 2011 we announced that our board of directors approved a 20  increase in the celanese quarterly series a common stock cash dividend the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate from  005  to  006  per share of series a common stock on a quarterly basis which equates to an increase from 020  to 024  per share of series a common stock annually the new dividend rate is applicable to dividends payable beginning in august 2011 on january 5 2012  we declared a cash dividend of 006  per share on our series a common stock amounting to 9 million  the cash dividends are for the period from november 1 2011  to january 31 2012  and will be paid on february 1 2012  to holders of record as of january 18 2012  

our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock as follows 

these authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased this repurchase program does not have an expiration date 

the share repurchase activity pursuant to this authorization is as follows 

the purchase of treasury stock will reduce the number of shares outstanding and the repurchased shares may be used by us for compensation programs utilizing our stock and other corporate purposes we account for treasury stock using the cost method and include treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity 

contractual debt and cash obligations 

the following table sets forth our fixed contractual debt and cash obligations as of december 31 2011  



 

1     we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements that expire on january 2 2014 accounted for as cash flow hedges that have the economic effect of modifying the variable rate obligations associated with our term loans into fixed interest obligations the impact of these interest rate swaps was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt future interest expense is calculated using the rate in effect on december 31 2011  

2 other debt of 383 million  is primarily made up of fixed rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds shortterm borrowings from affiliated companies and other bank obligations 

3    due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities we are unable to determine the timing of payments related to our uncertain tax obligations including interest and penalties these amounts are therefore reflected in “after 5 years” 

4     unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the takeorpay provisions included in certain longterm purchase agreements we do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements these amounts also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements energy and utility agreements consulting contracts software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts obtained via a survey of the company 

 contractual guarantees and commitments 

as of december 31 2011  we have current standby letters of credit of 74 million  and bank guarantees of 9 million outstanding which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements in addition the senior notes issued by celanese us are guaranteed by celanese and certain domestic subsidiaries of celanese us see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of this guarantee and the guarantees under our senior credit facility 

see note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any material offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

we test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker our operating business segments have been designated as our reporting units and include advanced engineered materials acetate products nutrinova emulsions celanese eva performance polymers formerly at plastics and acetyl intermediates businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value 

the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates the companys theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are 

established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

for all significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying value of the asset by a substantial margin at the date of the most recent impairment test 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to the companys assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if needed based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax planning strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us netherlands luxembourg france spain china the united kingdom and canada we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in 2009 based on cumulative profitability the company concluded that the us valuation allowance should be reversed except for a portion related to certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are not likely to be realized 

we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being 

realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

 we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the pension protection act of 2006 various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our net periodic benefit cost is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2011  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us defined benefit pension plans which represent approximately 82  and 86  of our fair value of pension plan assets and projected benefit obligation respectively on average the actual return on the us qualified defined pension plans assets over the longterm 20 years has exceeded 85 

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase net periodic benefit cost by an estimated 5 million in 2012 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2011  we decreased the discount rate to 46  from 530  as of december 31 2010 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in our discount rate will increase our annual net periodic benefit costs by an estimated 8 million and increase our benefit obligations by approximately 170 million for our us pension plans in addition the same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our annual net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations by less than 1 million and 9 million respectively for our us postretirement medical plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the nonus pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement annual net periodic benefit costs by approximately 1 million and less than 1 million respectively and will increase our benefit obligations by approximately 35 million and 2 million respectively 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the apbo as of december 31 2011  increasing by approximately 5 million and decreasing by 4 million respectively additionally increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the 2011 postretirement benefit cost changing by less than 1 million 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook we determine the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested a single longterm expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the longterm expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan 

differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets are generally not recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the year that the difference occurs these differences are deferred and amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining future service of employees we apply the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets to a marketrelated value of plan assets to stabilize variability in the plan asset values 

 we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience with respect to environmental remediation liabilities it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “fasb asc” topic 450 contingencies and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  “fasb asc topic 815” 

see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk management 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate borrowings we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate obligation these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

our usdollar interest rate swap derivative arrangements are as follows 

 

 61 



 

 our euro interest rate swap derivative arrangements are as follows 



 

 as of december 31 2011  we had 11 billion  €219 million  and cny10 billion  of variable rate debt and outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional values of 11 billion that expire january 2 2014 which are accounted for as cash flow hedges these interest rate swap agreements have the economic effect of modifying the variable rate obligations into fixed interest obligations which leaves 39 million  €219 million  and cny10 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by 5 million  on february 1 2012 the company executed forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 500 million which are effective january 2 2014 through january 2 2016 

foreign exchange risk management 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted transactions forward contracts are not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic 815 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to short long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency all of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables receivables intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

commodity risk management 

we have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement of certain raw materials we manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase agreements we regularly assess our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity requirements under forward purchase agreements and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in market conditions forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity for qualifying contracts we have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of fasb asc topic 815 based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that we would not settle net and the transaction would settle by physical delivery of the commodity as such realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract 

in addition we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy source typically these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting these instruments are marked to market at each reporting period and gains losses are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations we recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  as of december 31 2011  we did not have any open financial derivative contracts for commodities

in connection with the extension of the venture we reassessed the factors surrounding the accounting method for this investment and changed from the cost method of accounting for investments to the equity method of accounting for investments beginning april 1 2010 

 

korea engineering plastics co ltd founded in 1987 kepco is the leading producer of pom in south korea mitsubishi gas chemical company inc owns 40 and mitsubishi corporation owns 10 of kepco kepco operates a pom plant in ulsan south korea and participates with polyplastics and mitsubishi gas chemical company inc in a pom facility in nantong china 

 

polyplastics co ltd polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineered plastics in the asiapacific region polyplastics’ principal production facilities are located in japan taiwan malaysia and china polyplastics is a producer and marketer of pom in the asiapacific region 

 

fortron industries llc fortron is a leading global producer of pps fortron’s facility is located in wilmington north carolina 

 

china acetate strategic ventures we hold an approximately 30 ownership interest 50 board representation in three separate acetate products production entities in china the nantong kunming and zhuhai cellulose fiber companies in each instance the chinese stateowned tobacco entity china national tobacco corporation controls the remainder with an estimated 30 share of the world’s cigarette production and consumption china is the world’s largest and fastest growing area for acetate tow products according to the 2009 stanford research institute international chemical economics handbook combined these ventures are a leader in chinese domestic acetate production and are well positioned to supply chinese cigarette producers 

 

in december 2009 we announced plans with china national tobacco to expand our acetate flake and tow capacity at our nantong facility during 2010 we received formal approval to expand flake and tow capacities each by 30000 tons our chinese acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash flow we made contributions during 2010 of 12 million and have committed to contributions of 17 million in 2011 related to the capacity expansion in nantong 

 

our chinese acetate ventures pay a dividend in the second quarter of each fiscal year based on the ventures’ performance for the preceding year in 2010 2009 and 2008 we received cash dividends of 71 million 56 million and 46 million respectively 

 

despite the fact that our ownership interest exceeds 20 in each of our china acetate products ventures we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” 

  

infraservs we hold ownership interests in several infraserv entities located in germany that own and develop industrial parks and provide onsite general and administrative support to tenants the table below represents our equity investments in infraserv ventures as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and acetaldehyde although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier there cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year 

 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as supply and demand fundamentals change our production facilities rely largely on fuel oil natural gas coal and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by one of our subsidiaries which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts 

 

we also currently purchase and lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the manufacture of acetyl intermediates products for precious metals the leases are distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product and are divided into several contracts 

 

research and development 

 

all of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness our businesses are innovationoriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications we consider the amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be sufficient to drive our current strategic initiatives 

 

intellectual property 

 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing patents may cover processes products intermediate products and product uses we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products we protect our intellectual property vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate 

 

patents in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption 

controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor competitive developments and vigorously defend against infringements on our intellectual property rights

environmental and other regulation 

 

matters pertaining to environmental and other regulations are discussed in item 1a risk factors  item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates – accounting for commitments and contingencies  and note 15 and note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

the approximate number of employees employed by celanese on a continuing basis throughout the world is as follows 

 

 

 

many of our employees are unionized particularly in germany canada mexico the united kingdom brazil and belgium in the united states however less than one quarter of our employees are unionized moreover in germany and france wages and general working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements within the limits established by these agreements our various subsidiaries negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations such as workers’ councils representing the employees collective bargaining agreements between the german chemical employers associations and unions relating to remuneration generally have a term of one year while in the united states a three year term for collective bargaining agreements is typical we offer comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory 

backlog 

 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

 

risks related to our business 

 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers and customers participate are cyclical in nature both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

some of the industries in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control the industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse applications and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers’ products the consequences of this could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors the occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations 

 

we operate globally and have customers in many countries we have major facilities primarily located in north america europe and asia and hold interests in ventures that operate in the us germany china japan south korea taiwan and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices also our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these 

jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

 

in addition to the worldwide economic downturn conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities civil unrest epidemics pandemics weather the effects of climate change or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere 

 

failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations or court decisions could expose us to fines penalties and other costs moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states german european union “eu” or asian governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock although we maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the operation of our business there can be no assurance that the types of insurance we obtain or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all 

 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this region’s growth has slowed and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene and methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally acetic acid vam and formaldehyde we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our business segments we also purchase significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of such item and may increase significantly as a result of production disruptions or strikes in particular to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals such as natural gas ethylene and methanol can have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs 

 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene wood pulp electricity and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 

  

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs or if such commodities were unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

 

our operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected for example we recently announced our intention to construct new ethanol manufacturing facilities in china and the us that will utilize advanced technology developed with elements of our proprietary advanced acetyl platform however as we invest in the commercialization of this new process technology we face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations construction delays cost overruns the unavailability of required materials and equipment and various other factors likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

 

us federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could if passed into law require us to relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

regulations are being implemented by the us department of homeland security “dhs” aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and security plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we have registered certain of our sites with dhs in accordance with these regulations have conducted vulnerability assessments at applicable sites and are awaiting dhs review and approval of security plans until that is done we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these obligations include the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” and the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 “rcra” related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst ag also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters including cercla and rcra we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate any one of those laws or regulations we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture transport use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present one example of such regulations is the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants “neshap” for industrial commercial and institutional boilers which was issued in 

draft form by the environmental protection agency “epa” on april 29 2010 in its current draft form these rules could require us to make significant capital expenditures to comply with stricter emissions requirements for industrial boilers at our facilities consequently compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities which could adversely affect our business and cause our operating results to be less favorable than expected an adverse outcome in these claim procedures may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products 

 

in june 2009 the california office of environmental health hazard assessment “oehha” formally proposed to add vam along with 11 other substances to a list of chemicals “known to the state of california” to cause cancer oehha is required to maintain this list under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 “proposition 65” celanese filed comments in opposition to the proposed listing because the listing was not based on a scientific review of the relevant data and the legal standard for adding vam to the proposition 65 list had not been met celanese also filed an action in the sacramento county superior court seeking declaration that oehha’s proposed listing of vam would be contrary to law the superior court granted celanese’s request for relief an appeal filed by oehha is pending in the california court of appeal 

 

we can provide no assurance that the sacramento county superior court decision will be affirmed on appeal or that vam or other chemicals we produce will not be classified in other jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products 

 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer “iarc” a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in october 2009 iarc also concluded based on a recent study that there is sufficient evidence for a casual association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia we expect the results of iarc’s review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

 

other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act “tsca” in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” 

 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance 

 

the development manufacture and sales of specialty chemical products by us including products produced for the food beverage cigarette and pharmaceutical industries involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls product seizures and related adverse publicity a product liability claim or judgment against 

us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and divert management’s attention from other responsibilities although we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost if at all a product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation regulation and international accords 

 

greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu similarly numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress which could adversely impact all industries in addition the epa has promulgated rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions and regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation 

 

while not all are likely to become law this is a strong indication that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices establishing costly emissions trading schemes and requiring modification of equipment to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

 

a step toward potential federal restriction on greenhouse gas emissions was taken on december 7 2009 when the environmental protection agency “epa” issued its endangerment finding in response to a decision of the supreme court of the united states the epa found that the emission of six greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare based on this finding the epa defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be “air pollution” subject to regulation under the clean air act although the epa has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing clean air act absent legislative action the epa has begun to regulate many sources of greenhouse gas emissions 

 

for example on january 2 2011 many large sources of greenhouse gas emissions became subject to the requirements of the prevention of significant deterioration “psd” permitting program the psd permitting program requires these large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to install best available control technology “bact” to limit greenhouse gas emissions when modifying equipment if the increased greenhouse gas emissions will exceed 75000 tons per year texas however has refused to implement the psd permitting program for greenhouse gas emissions which prompted the epa to attempt to take over ghg permitting from the state regulators late last year on december 30 2010 an appellate court stayed epa’s action pending a determination of whether epa’s takeover complies with the us clean air act additionally the epa announced on december 23 2010 that it would impose further greenhouse gas emission limits on electric generating units and petroleum refineries through the establishment of new source performance standards “nsps” 

 

the us congress recently considered legislation that would create an economywide “capandtrade” system that would establish a limit or cap on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase andor sale of emissions permits or “allowances” under these proposals the chemical industry likely would be affected due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances which they would be required to obtain to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the company or its energy suppliers in addition capandtrade proposals would likely increase the cost of energy including purchases of steam and electricity and certain raw materials used by the company 

 

other countries are also considering or have implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions future environmental legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials finished products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands 

 

a disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers in particular production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments such as acetic acid vam and formaldehyde could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operation to the extent of such vertical integration furthermore to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to be sufficiently increased in the future 

 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings below 

 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business which could affect adversely our business or results of operations 

 

as part of our growth strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities successful accomplishment of this objective may be limited by the availability and suitability of acquisition candidates and by our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining appropriate valuation integrating operations technologies services and products of the acquired lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business matters in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe that we anticipate or at all which could affect adversely our business or results of operations 

 

we may experience unexpected difficulties and incur unexpected costs in the relocation of our ticona plant from kelsterbach to the rhine main area which may increase our costs delay the transition or disrupt our ability to supply our customers 

 

we have agreed with frankfurt germany airport “fraport” to relocate our kelsterbach germany operations to another location resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned frankfurt airport expansion in july 2007 we announced that we would relocate the kelsterbach germany operations to the hoechst industrial park in the rhine main area fraport agreed to pay ticona a total of €670 million over a 5year period to offset costs associated with the closure of the kelsterbach plant and the transition of the operations from its current location as the relocation project progressed we decided to expand the scope of the new production facilities and now expect to spend in excess of the proceeds to be received from fraport because the relocation of our kelsterbach germany operations represents a major logistical undertaking the construction of our new facilities may be delayed actual costs may exceed our revised estimates and we may be subject to penalties if we have not timely vacated the kelsterbach location if the relocation causes other unexpected difficulties our costs may increase or supplies to our customers may be disrupted 

 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

 

because we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary’s functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies unless we have cash flows in those foreign currencies from our foreign operations sufficient to repay that indebtedness out of those cash flows 

 

we use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected or actual rate of return on plan assets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented to minimize the influence of liability volatility due to interest rate movements similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years if the value of our pension fund’s portfolio declines we may be required to contribute capital in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned 

 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

 

we attach great importance to our patents trademarks copyrights and knowhow and trade secrets in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing we have also adopted rigorous internal policies for protecting our valuable knowhow and trade secrets we sometimes license patents and other technology from third parties our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages in our major markets patents may cover catalysts processes products intermediate products and product uses these patents provide varying periods of protection based on the filing date of the patent application and the legal life of patents type of patent and its scope in the various countries in which we seek protection as patents expire the catalysts processes and products described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated knowhow and trade secrets we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired we operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may bring us to additional regions with similar challenges if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any shareholders’ rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement the “domination agreement” andor the compensation paid in connection with the squeeze out may be increased which may further reduce the funds that our subsidiary bcp holdings gmbh a german limited liability company “bcp holdings” can otherwise make available to us 

 

several minority shareholders of celanese gmbh have initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination agreement on december 12 2006 the frankfurt district court appointed an expert to help determine the value of celanese ag as of july 31 2004 on which date an extraordinary shareholder meeting of celanese ag was held to resolve the domination agreement as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment could be increased by the court and bcp holdings would be required to make such payments within two months after the publication of the court’s ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds bcp holdings can make available to us and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the company also received applications for the commencement of award proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against bcp holdings with the frankfurt district court requesting the court to set a higher amount for the squeezeout compensation should the court set a higher value for the squeezeout compensation former celanese ag shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of celanese ag due to the squeezeout are entitled pursuant to a settlement agreement between bcp holdings and certain former celanese ag shareholders to claim for their shares the higher of the compensation amounts determined by the court in these different proceedings previously received compensation for their shares will be offset so that those shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of celanese ag due to the squeezeout are not entitled to more than higher of the amount set in the two court proceedings 

 

celanese deutschland holding gmbh “cdh” may be required to compensate bcp holdings for annual losses which may reduce the funds cdh can otherwise make available to us

bcp holdings may be required to compensate celanese gmbh for annual losses which may reduce the funds bcp holdings can otherwise make available to us

risks related to our indebtedness 

 

our level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

 

our total indebtedness is approximately 32 billion as of december 31 2010 see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future which could increase the risks described above 

 

although covenants under the senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the 600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6 5  8  senior notes due 2018 the “notes” limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be significant to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our leverage described above including our possible inability to service our debt including the notes would increase 

 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results 

 

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase as of december 31 2010 

we had 16 billion €296 million and cny 15 billion of variable rate debt of which 15 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves 73 million €146 million and cny 15 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 5 million see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

 

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

the senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the notes each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the indenture governing the notes will limit celanese us’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur additional debt pay dividends or make other restricted payments consummate specified asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make payments to celanese us and its restricted subsidiaries merge or consolidate with any other person and sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of celanese us’s assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries 

 

in addition the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

 

such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us having to obtain the consent of holders of the notes and of our lenders in order to take certain actions disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a default under the senior credit agreement could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the senior credit agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the senior credit agreement if the lenders under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness we may not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness including the notes in such event we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

celanese and celanese us are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations under the notes and the guarantee of celanese us’s obligations under the notes by celanese 

 

as holding companies celanese and celanese us conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries which own substantially all of our consolidated assets consequently the principal source of cash to pay celanese and celanese us’s obligations including obligations under the notes and the guarantee of the celanese us’s obligations under the notes by celanese is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations we cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable celanese us andor celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances applicable state laws regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit celanese us’s and celanese’s ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing the notes limits the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions which may have the effect of significantly restricting the applicability of those limits in the event celanese us andor celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries celanese us andor celanese may be unable to make required payments on the notes the guarantee of celanese us’s obligations under the notes by celanese or our other indebtedness

consolidated results — year ended december 31 2010 compared with year ended december 31 2009 

 

during 2010 the global economy gradually began to recover from the challenging economic environment we experienced during the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 net sales increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increased volumes as a result of the gradual recovery and increased selling prices across the majority of our business segments the increase in net sales resulting from our acquisition of fact gmbh future advanced composites technology “fact” in december 2009 only slightly offset the decrease in net sales due to the sale of 

our polyvinyl alcohol “pvoh” business in july 2009 within our industrial specialties segment unfavorable foreign currency impacts only slightly offset the increase in net sales 

 

gross profit increased due to higher net sales gross profit as a percentage of sales remained consistent with prior year as increased pricing offset increased raw material and energy costs 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we wroteoff other productive assets of 18 million related to our singapore and nanjing china facilities in march 2010 we recorded 22 million of accelerated amortization to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009 the accelerated amortization was recorded as 20 million to our acetyl intermediates segment and 2 million to our advanced engineered materials segment both the writeoff of other productive assets and accelerated amortization were recorded to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31 2010 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased during 2010 primarily due to the increase in net sales and higher legal costs and costs associated with business optimization initiatives as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses declined slightly as compared to 2009 due to our continued fixed spending reduction efforts restructuring efficiencies and a positive impact from foreign currency 

 

other charges gains net decreased 90 million during 2010 as compared to 2009 

 

 

 

in march 2010 we concluded that certain longlived assets were partially impaired at our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in spondon derby united kingdom accordingly we wrote down the related property plant and equipment to its fair value of 31 million resulting in longlived asset impairment losses of 72 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as a result of the announced closure of our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations in spondon derby united kingdom we recorded 15 million of employee termination benefits during the year ended december 31 2010 

 

as a result of our pardies france “project of closure” we recorded exit costs of 12 million during the year ended december 31 2010 which consisted of 6 million in employee termination benefits 1 million of longlived asset impairment losses 2 million of contract termination costs and other plant closure costs and 3 million of reindustrialization costs 

 

due to certain events in october 2008 and subsequent periodic cessations of production of our specialty polymers products produced at our eva performance polymers facility in edmonton alberta canada we declared two events of force majeure during 2009 we replaced longlived assets damaged in october 2008 as a result of these events and subsequent periodic cessations of production we recorded 18 million of net insurance recoveries consisting of 8 million related to property damage and 10 million related to business interruption 

as a result of several business optimization projects undertaken by us beginning in 2009 and continuing throughout 2010 we recorded 11 million in employee termination costs during the year ended december 31 2010 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded 14 million of recoveries and 45 million of reductions in legal reserves related to lawsuits alleging that certain plastics utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail see note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the plumbing actions 

 

in november 2006 we finalized a settlement agreement with the frankfurt germany airport “fraport” to relocate the kelsterbach germany ticona operations resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned fraport expansion during 2010 we recorded 26 million of expenses related to the ticona kelsterbach relocation see note 28 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

 

other charges for the year ended december 31 2010 also included gains of 13 million net related to settlements in resolution of a commercial disputes 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates and dividend income from cost investments increased during 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 our strategic affiliates have experienced similar volume increases due to increased demand during the year ended december 31 2010 as a result our proportional share of net earnings from equity affiliates increased 69 million and our dividend income from cost investments increased 16 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 

 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2010 was 21 compared to 97 for the year ended december 31 2009 our effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the us valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets partially offset by increases in valuation allowances on certain foreign net deferred tax assets and the effect of new tax legislation in mexico the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2010 was favorably impacted by amendments to tax legislation in mexico 

 

consolidated results — year ended december 31 2009 compared with year ended december 31 2008 

 

the challenging economic environment in the united states and europe during the second half of 2008 continued throughout 2009 net sales declined in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of decreased demand due to the significant weakness of the global economy in july 2009 we completed the sale of our pvoh business which also contributed to the declines in our sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2009 we began to see a gradual recovery in the global economy with increasing demand within some of our business segments a decrease in selling prices was also a significant factor on the decrease in net sales decreases in key raw material and energy costs were the primary factors in lower selling prices a slightly unfavorable foreign currency impact also contributed to the decrease in net sales 

 

gross profit declined due to lower net sales as a percentage of sales gross profit increased as lower raw material and energy costs more than offset decreases in net sales during the period 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased during 2009 primarily due to business optimization and finance improvement initiatives 

other charges gains net increased 28 million during 2009 as compared to 2008 

 

 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we began efforts to align production capacity and staffing levels with our view of an economic environment of prolonged lower demand for the year ended december 31 2009 other charges included employee termination benefits of 40 million related to this endeavor as a result of the shutdown of the vinyl acetate monomer “vam” production unit in cangrejera mexico we recognized employee termination benefits of 1 million and longlived asset impairment losses of 1 million during the year ended december 31 2009 

 

as a result of the “project of closure” at our pardies france facility other charges included exit costs of 89 million during the year ended december 31 2009 which consisted of 60 million in employee termination benefits 17 million of contract termination costs and 12 million of longlived asset impairment losses 

 

due to continued declines in demand in automotive and electronic sectors we announced plans to reduce capacity by ceasing polyester polymer production at our ticona manufacturing plant in shelby north carolina other charges for the year ended december 31 2009 included employee termination benefits of 2 million and longlived asset impairment losses of 1 million related to this event 

 

other charges for the year ended december 31 2009 was partially offset by 6 million of net insurance recoveries in satisfaction of claims we made related to the unplanned outage of our clear lake texas acetic acid facility during 2007 a 9 million decrease in legal reserves for plumbing claims due to the company’s ongoing assessment of the likely outcome of the plumbing actions and the expiration of the statute of limitation 

 

in november 2006 we finalized a settlement agreement with the frankfurt germany airport “fraport” to relocate the kelsterbach germany ticona operations resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned fraport expansion during 2009 we recorded 16 million of expenses related to the ticona kelsterbach relocation 

 

operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher other charges partially offset by lower selling general and administrative costs 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased during 2009 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand 

 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2009 was 97 compared to 15 for the year ended december 31 2008 our effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the us valuation allowance partially offset by lower earnings in jurisdictions participating in tax holidays increases in valuation allowances on certain foreign net deferred tax assets and the effect of new tax legislation in mexico

factors affecting business segment net sales 

 

the table below sets forth the percentage increase decrease in net sales for the years ended december 31 attributable to each of the factors indicated for the following business segments 

 

 

 

  

business segment — year ended december 31 2010 compared with year ended december 31 2009 

 

advanced engineered materials 

 

 

 

our advanced engineered materials segment develops produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty polymers for application in automotive medical and electronics products as well as other consumer and industrial applications together with our strategic affiliates our advanced engineered 

materials segment is a leading participant in the global specialty polymers industry the primary products of advanced engineered materials are pom pps longfiber reinforced thermoplastics “lft” polybutylene terephthalate “pbt” polyethylene terephthalate “pet” ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene “gur ® ” and lcp pom pps lft pbt and pet are used in a broad range of products including automotive components electronics appliances and industrial applications gur ® is used in battery separators conveyor belts filtration equipment coatings and medical devices primary end markets for lcp are electrical and electronics 

 

advanced engineered materials’ net sales increased 301 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in net sales is primarily related to significant increases in volume which are due to the gradual recovery in the global economy continued success in the innovation and commercialization of new products and applications and the acquisition of fact in december 2009 net sales was also positively impacted by increases in average pricing as a result of implemented price increases in addition to integrating the dupont product lines lcp and pct that were acquired in may 2010 into our sales process during the fourth quarter these increases were only partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

 

operating profit increased 148 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 the positive impact from higher sales volumes increased pricing for our high performance polymers and higher production volumes including a planned inventory build for the relocation of our facility in kelsterbach germany more than offset higher raw material and energy costs other charges positively impacted operating profit for the year ended december 31 2010 driven by a 45 million decrease in legal reserves and 14 million of recoveries associated with plumbing actions partially offset by expenses related to our european expansion and kelsterbach relocation depreciation and amortization includes 2 million of accelerated amortization for the year ended december 31 2010 to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax increased for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased operating profit and increased equity in net earnings of affiliates our equity affiliates including ibn sina have experienced similar volume increases due to increased demand during the year ended december 31 2010 as a result our proportional share of net earnings of these affiliates increased 66 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 

 

the economic outlook within the automotive and electronic industries continues to look favorable entering into 2011 with seasonally strong demand we are anticipating a continued strong valueinuse pricing environment supported by higher raw material costs as we progress with the relocation of our kelsterbach germany operations and expansion of capacity in europe we will continue to build inventory to support our customers in their product qualification process 

consumer specialties 

 

 

 

our consumer specialties segment consists of our acetate products and nutrinova businesses our acetate products business primarily produces and supplies acetate tow which is used in the production of filter products we also produce acetate flake which is processed into acetate tow and acetate film our nutrinova business produces and sells sunett ®  a high intensity sweetener and food protection ingredients such as sorbates and sorbic acid for the food beverage and pharmaceuticals industries 

 

net sales for consumer specialties increased 14 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in volume and price in our acetate products business more than offset the decline in volume and price in our nutrinova business as lower demand in sunett ® negatively impacted net sales 

 

during the first half of 2010 we experienced a decline in net sales related to an electrical disruption and subsequent production outage at our acetate products manufacturing facility in narrows virginia the facility resumed normal operations during the second quarter of 2010 and we recovered the impacted volume during the second half of 2010 as we experienced increased volumes in our acetate products business due to higher demand in acetate tow and improved business in acetate film 

 

operating profit decreased for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 an increase in other charges for the year ended december 31 2010 had the most significant impact on operating profit as it was unfavorably impacted by longlived asset impairment losses of 72 million associated with management’s assessment of the closure of our acetate flake and tow production operations in spondon derby united kingdom during the three months ended march 31 2010 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 earnings from continuing operations before tax decreased due to lower operating profit which was partially offset by higher dividends from our china ventures of 15 million compared to 2009 

 

we expect demand to be relatively flat during the first quarter of 2011 however slightly lower sales are expected due to seasonal trends margin expansion driven by sustainable productivity initiatives is expected to continue in 2011 in addition we expect spending to be higher during the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 due to plant turnaround costs 

industrial specialties 

 

 

 

our industrial specialties segment includes our emulsions and eva performance polymers businesses our emulsions business is a global leader that produces a broad product portfolio specializing in vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and is a recognized authority on low volatile organic compounds an environmentallyfriendly technology our emulsions products are used in a wide array of applications including paints and coatings adhesives construction glass fiber textiles and paper eva performance polymers business offers a complete line of lowdensity polyethylene and specialty eva resins and compounds eva performance polymers’ products are used in many applications including flexible packaging films lamination film products hot melt adhesives medical devices and tubing automotive carpeting and solar cell encapsulation films 

 

in july 2009 we completed the sale of our pvoh business to sekisui chemical co ltd “sekisui” for a net cash purchase price of 168 million excluding the value of accounts receivable and payable we retained the transaction resulted in a gain on disposition of 34 million and includes longterm supply agreements between sekisui and celanese 

 

net sales increased for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increased net sales were a result of higher growth and innovation volumes from our emulsions business and higher volumes from our eva performance polymers business partially offset by impacts resulting from the sale of our pvoh business in july 2009 the increase in our eva performance polymers business’ volumes was partly as a result of our edmonton alberta canada plant being fully operational during 2010 volumes were lower during 2009 due to technical issues at our edmonton alberta canada plant such technical production issues were resolved and normal operations resumed prior to the end of the third quarter of 2009 higher prices in our eva performance polymers business due to price increases and favorable product mix were partially offset by lower prices in our emulsions business due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

 

due to certain events in october 2008 and subsequent periodic cessations of production of our specialty polymers products produced at our eva performance polymers facility in edmonton alberta canada we declared two events of force majeure during 2009 we replaced longlived assets damaged in october 2008 as a result of these events and subsequent periodic cessation of production we recorded 25 million and 10 million of insurance recoveries to other charges during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively these amounts were partially offset by 7 million and 10 million respectively recorded as a charge by our captive insurance companies included in the other activities segment the net insurance recoveries recorded during the year ended december 31 2010 of 18 million consisted of 8 million related to property damage and 10 million related to business interruption 

 

operating profit remained unchanged for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increases in operating profit in 2010 are primarily due to the resumption of normal operations at our eva 

performance polymers facility net insurance proceeds received in 2010 and increases in sales volumes and prices these increases were offset by the 2009 gain on disposition of assets related to the divestiture of our pvoh business and higher raw material costs in both our eva performance polymers and emulsions businesses 

 

in 2011 we expect to see positive industry conditions with volume demands continuing to increase from those levels experienced in 2010 we also anticipate margin expansion due to a robust pricing environment and higher margins on new products 

 

acetyl intermediates 

 

 

 

our acetyl intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl products including acetic acid vam acetic anhydride and acetate esters these products are generally used as starting materials for colorants paints adhesives coatings textiles medicines and more other chemicals produced in this business segment are organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical products to meet the growing demand for acetic acid in china and to support ongoing site optimization efforts we successfully expanded our acetic acid unit in nanjing china from 600000 tons per reactor annually to 12 million tons per reactor annually during the fourth quarter of 2009 using new aoplus ® 2 capability the acetic acid unit could be further expanded to 15 million tons per reactor annually with only modest additional capital 

 

acetyl intermediates’ net sales increased 479 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 due to improvement in the global economy resulting in increased overall demand across all regions for the major acetyl derivative product lines increases in volume were also a direct result of our successful acetic acid expansion at our nanjing china plant we also experienced favorable pricing which was driven by rising raw material costs and price increases in acetic acid and vam across all regions the increase in net sales was only slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

 

operating profit increased during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in operating profit is primarily due to higher volumes and prices and reduction in plant costs resulting from the closure of our less advantaged acetic acid and vam production operations in pardies france a decrease in other charges due primarily to the reduction of plant closure costs related to the 2009 closure of our pardies france facility also had a favorable impact on operating profit these increases to operating profit were only slightly offset by higher variable costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts higher variable costs were a direct result of price increases in all major raw materials depreciation and amortization includes 20 million of accelerated amortization for the year ended december 31 2010 to writeoff the asset associated with a raw material purchase agreement with a supplier who filed for bankruptcy during 2009 

earnings from continuing operations before tax increased during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased operating profit 

 

entering into 2011 we expect to see a relatively flat first quarter decreasing volumes in asia as a result of the chinese new year are expected to offset seasonal increases in demand in the us and europe overall growth in asia for 2011 is anticipated in addition our advanced acetyl technology is expected to sustain acetic acid margins and process innovation and productivity are expected to positively impact 2011 

 

other activities 

 

other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including financing and administrative activities and our captive insurance companies 

 

the operating loss for other activities increased 19 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the increase was primarily due to a 38 million increase in selling general and administrative costs which was only partially offset by a 14 million gain on the sale of an office building higher selling general and administrative expenses were primarily due to higher legal costs and costs associated with business optimization initiatives 

 

the loss from continuing operations before tax increased 27 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the increase is primarily related to 16 million of fees associated with our debt refinancing that occurred during the three months ended september 30 2010 

 

business segment — year ended december 31 2009 compared with year ended december 31 2008 

 

advanced engineered materials 

 

 

 

net sales decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes significant weakness in the global economy experienced during the first half of the year resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for automotive electrical and electronic products as well as for other industrial products as a result sales volumes dropped significantly across all product lines during the second half of 2009 we experienced a continued increase in demand compared with the first half of the year as a result of programs like “cash for clunkers” in the united states during the third quarter of 2009 and a gradual recovery in the global economy during the fourth quarter of 2009 

operating profit increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 lower raw material and energy costs and decreased overall spending more than offset the decline in net sales decreased overall spending was the result of our fixed spending reduction efforts noncapital spending incurred on the relocation of our ticona kelsterbach plant was flat compared to 2008 see note 28 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax was down due to a drop in equity in net earnings of affiliates as compared to 2008 equity in net earnings of affiliates was lower in 2009 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand and a biennial shutdown at one of our affiliate’s plants 

 

consumer specialties 

 

 

 

net sales decreased 71 million during 2009 when compared with 2008 the decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased volume due to softening demand largely in tow with less significant decreases experienced in flake decreased volumes were primarily due to weakness in underlying demand resulting from the global economic downturn the decrease in volume was partially offset by an increase in selling prices a slightly unfavorable foreign currency impact also contributed to the decrease in net sales 

 

operating profit increased from 190 million in 2008 to 231 million in 2009 fixed cost reduction efforts improved energy costs and a favorable currency impact on costs had a significant impact on the increase to operating profit 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax of 288 million increased from 2008 primarily due to the increase in operating profit and an increase in dividends from our china ventures of 10 million increased dividends are the result of increased volumes and higher prices as well as efficiency improvements 

industrial specialties 

 

 

 

net sales declined 432 million during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the sale of our pvoh business and lower demand due to the economic downturn the decline in our emulsions volumes was concentrated in north america and europe offset partially by volume increases in asia eva performance polymers’ volumes declined due to the impact of the force majeure event at our edmonton alberta canada plant which is offset in other charges in our other activities segment repairs to the plant were completed at the end of the second quarter 2009 and normal operations have resumed both decreases in key raw material costs resulting in lower selling prices and unfavorable currency impacts also contributed to the decline in net sales for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

operating profit increased 42 million in 2009 compared to 2008 as decreases in volume and selling prices were more than offset by lower raw material and energy costs and reduced overall spending reduced spending is attributable to our fixed spending reduction efforts restructuring efficiencies and favorable foreign currency impacts on costs energy is favorable due to lower natural gas costs and lower usage resulting from a decline in volumes our eva performance polymers business contributed to the increase in other charges gains net as a result of receiving 10 million in insurance recoveries in partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the force majeure event at our edmonton alberta canada plant the gain on the sale of our pvoh business of 34 million had a significant impact to the increase in operating profit depreciation and amortization also had a favorable impact on operating profit due to the pvoh divestiture and the shutdown of our warrington uk emulsions facility 

acetyl intermediates 

 

 

 

net sales decreased 33 during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower selling prices across all regions and major product lines lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts lower volumes were driven by a reduction in underlying demand in europe and in the americas which was only partially offset by significant increases in demand in asia lower pricing was driven by lower raw material and energy prices which also negatively impacted our formulabased pricing arrangements for vam in the us there were a number of production issues in asia among the major acetic acid producers other than celanese which coupled with planned outages caused periodic and shortterm market tightness 

 

operating profit declined 212 million primarily as a result of lower prices across all regions and major product lines significantly lower realized pricing was partially offset by favorable raw material and energy prices reduced spending due to the shutdown of our pampa texas facility and other reductions in fixed spending depreciation and amortization expense declined primarily as a result of the longlived asset impairment losses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to our acetic acid and vam production facility in pardies france the closure of our vam production unit in cangrejera mexico in february 2009 together with lower depreciation expense resulting from the shutdown of our pampa texas facility our operating profit was also negatively impacted by a 13 million increase in other charges for 2009 compared to 2008 relating primarily to the shutdown of our pardies france facility 

 

the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before tax of 210 million is consistent with the decline in operating profit 

 

other activities 

 

net sales remained flat in 2009 as compared to 2008 we do not expect thirdparty revenues from our captive insurance companies to increase significantly in the near future 

 

the operating loss for other activities increased from an operating loss of 138 million in 2008 to an operating loss of 160 million in 2009 the increase was primarily related to higher other charges the increase in other charges was related to insurance retention costs as a result of our force majeure event at our edmonton alberta canada plant which is offset in our industrial specialties segment and severance costs as a result of business optimization and finance improvement initiatives the increase in other charges was partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to our fixed spending reduction efforts and restructuring efficiencies 

the loss from continuing operations before tax decreased 11 million in 2009 compared to 2008 this decrease was primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on our senior credit facilities and favorable currency impact 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition as of december 31 2010 we have 145 million available for borrowing under our creditlinked revolving facility and 600 million available under our revolving credit facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations we have 17 lenders who participate in our revolving credit facility each with a commitment of not more than 10 of the 600 million commitment 

 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2011 if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 

 

in january 2011 our whollyowned subsidiary celanese far east limited signed letters of intent to construct and operate industrial ethanol production facilities in nanjing china at the nanjing chemical industrial park and in zhuhai china at the gaolan port economic zone pending project approvals we could begin industrial ethanol production within the next 30 months with expected nameplate capacity of 400000 tons per year per plant with an initial investment of approximately 300 million per plant we are pursuing approval at two locations to ensure our ability to effectively grow with future demand 

 

in april 2010 we announced that through our strategic venture ibn sina we will construct a 50000 ton pom production facility in saudi arabia our pro rata share of invested capital in the pom expansion is expected to total approximately 165 million over a three year period which began in late 2010 for the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred 2 million of capital expenditures we anticipate related cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2011 will be 10 million 

 

cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 350 million in 2011 excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach and capacity expansion in europe per the terms of our agreement with fraport we expect to receive the final cash installment of €110 million in 2011 subject to downward adjustments based on our readiness to close our operations at our kelsterbach germany facility as the relocation project progressed we decided to expand the scope of the new production facilities and now expect to spend in excess of total proceeds to be received from fraport we anticipate related cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2011 will be €186 million 

 

in december 2009 we announced plans with china national tobacco to expand our acetate flake and tow capacity at our nantong facility during 2010 we received formal approval to expand flake and tow capacities each by 30000 tons our chinese acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash flow we made contributions during 2010 of 12 million and have committed to contributions of 17 million in 2011 related to the capacity expansion in nantong 

 

as a result of the planned closure of our acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations at the spondon derby united kingdom site we expect to record total expenses of approximately 35 to 45 million consisting of approximately 20 million for personnelrelated exit costs and approximately 20 million of other facilityrelated shutdown costs such as contract termination costs and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets we expect that substantially all of the exit costs except for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets of approximately 15 million will result in future cash expenditures cash outflows are expected to occur through 2011 for the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded exit costs of 15 million related to personnelrelated costs and 6 million related 

to accelerated depreciation see note 4 and note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

in addition to exitrelated costs associated with the closure of the spondon derby united kingdom acetate flake and tow manufacturing operations we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately 35 million in certain capacity and efficiency improvements principally at our lanaken belgium facility to optimize our global production network 

 

on a standalone basis celanese has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries and no independent external operations of its own as such celanese generally will depend on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to celanese in order for celanese to meet its obligations including its obligations under its series a common stock senior credit facilities and senior notes 

 

cash flows 

 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2010 were 740 million which was a decrease of 514 million from december 31 2009 cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2009 were 1254 million which was an increase of 578 million from december 31 2008 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 144 million to a cash inflow of 452 million in 2010 from a cash inflow of 596 million for the same period in 2009 the increase in trade working capital and the increases in cash paid for taxes and legal settlements which negatively affected cash provided by operating activities more than offset the increase in earnings and the increase in cash from our foreign currency hedges 

 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased 10 million to a cash inflow of 596 million in 2009 from a cash inflow of 586 million for the same period in 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by less cash paid for interest taxes and legal settlements coupled with a favorable change in trade working capital which helped to offset lower operating performance 

 

net cash provided by used in investing activities 

 

net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow of 31 million in 2009 to a cash outflow of 560 million for the same period in 2010 the decrease is primarily related to the receipt of proceeds of 412 million related to the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation and the receipt of 168 million for the sale of our pvoh business that were both received in 2009 there were no such proceeds in 2010 adding to the decrease was cash outflows of 46 million incurred in 2010 related to our acquisition of two product lines zenite ® lcp and thermx ® pct from dupont performance polymers as compared to the cash outflows for our fact business acquired in 2009 which were only 8 million 

 

net cash from investing activities increased from a cash outflow of 201 million in 2008 to a cash inflow of 31 million in 2009 net cash from investing activities increased primarily due to lower capital expenditures on property plant and equipment proceeds received from the sale of our pvoh business and increased deferred proceeds received on our ticona kelsterbach relocation these cash inflows were offset slightly by in increase on our capital expenditures related to our ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

 

our cash outflows for capital expenditures were 201 million 176 million and 274 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach capital expenditures were primarily related to major replacements of equipment capacity expansions major investments to reduce future operating costs and environmental and health and safety initiatives cash outflows for capital expenditures for our ticona plant in kelsterbach were €236 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

net cash used in financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities increased from a cash outflow of 112 million in 2009 to a cash outflow of 388 million for the same period in 2010 the 276 million increase primarily relates to the net pay down on longterm debt of 297 million and 48 million used to repurchase shares of the company’s series a common stock 

 

net cash for financing activities decreased from a cash outflow of 499 million in 2008 to a cash outflow of 112 million in 2009 the 387 million decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily related to cash outflows attributable to the repurchase of shares during 2008 of 378 million as compared to no shares repurchased during 2009 

 

in addition exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents was an unfavorable currency effect of 18 million in 2010 compared to a favorable impact of 63 million in 2009 and an unfavorable impact of 35 million in 2008

commitments relating to share capital 

 

we have a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of series a common stock par value 00001 per share in april 2010 we announced that our board of directors approved a 25 increase in the celanese quarterly series a common stock cash dividend the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate from 004 to 005 per share of series a common stock on a quarterly basis which equates to 016 to 020 per share of series a common stock annually the new dividend rate was applicable to dividends payable beginning in august 2010 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we paid 28 million 23 million and 24 million respectively in cash dividends on our series a common stock on january 6 2011 we declared an 8 million cash dividend which was paid on february 1 2011 

 

in february 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 400 million of our series a common stock this authorization was increased to 500 million in october 2008 the authorization gives management discretion in determining the conditions under which shares may be repurchased this repurchase program does not 

have an expiration date the number or shares repurchased and the average purchase price paid per share pursuant to this authorization are as follows

market risks 

 

please see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks 

 

  

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

 

we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 

  

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

 

we test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments where discrete financial information is available for our reporting units and operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management our business units have been designated as our reporting units based on business segment management’s review of and reliance 

on the business unit financial information and include advanced engineered materials acetate products nutrinova emulsions celanese eva performance polymers formerly at plastics and acetyl intermediates businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value 

 

the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates the company’s theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

 

for all significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying value of the asset by a substantial margin at the date of the most recent impairment test our methodology for determining impairment for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets was consistent with that used in the prior year 

 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is 

being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to the company’s assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 

  

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if needed based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax planning strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us netherlands luxembourg france spain china the united kingdom and canada we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in 2009 based on cumulative profitability the company concluded that the us valuation allowance should be reversed except for a portion related to certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are not likely to be realized 

 

we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 

 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation 

allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset in addition the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

 

  

we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the pension protection act of 2006 based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 

 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2010 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us defined benefit pension plans which represent approximately 82 and 85 of our fair value of pension plan assets and projected benefit obligation respectively on average the actual return on the us qualified defined pension plans’ assets over the longterm 20 years has exceeded 85 

 

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 5 million in 2011 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2010 we decreased the discount rate to 530 from 590 as of december 31 2009 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in our discount rate will increase our annual pension expenses by an estimated 6 million and increase our benefit obligations by approximately 146 million for our us pension plans in addition the same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than 1 million and 9 million respectively for our us postretirement medical plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the nonus pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by approximately 1 million and less than 1 million respectively and will increase our benefit obligations by approximately 32 million and 2 million respectively 

 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the apbo as of december 31 2010 increasing by approximately 4 million and decreasing by 4 million respectively additionally increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the 2010 postretirement benefit cost changing by less than 1 million 

 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook we determine the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested a single longterm expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the 

target asset allocation and the longterm expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan 

 

differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets are generally not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs these differences are deferred and amortized into pension expense over the average remaining future service of employees we apply the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets to a marketrelated value of plan assets to stabilize variability in the plan asset values 

 

  

we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience with respect to environmental remediation liabilities it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification “fasb asc” topic 450 contingencies and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risks 

 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging “fasb asc topic 815” 

 

see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate obligation these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

 

in august 2010 we executed a forwardstarting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 11 billion as a result of the swap we have fixed the libor portion of 11 billion of the company’s floating rate debt at 17125 effective january 2 2012 through january 2 2014 

our usdollar interest rate swap derivative arrangements are as follows 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

our euro interest rate swap derivative arrangements are as follows 

 

 

 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had 16 billion €296 million and cny 15 billion of variable rate debt of which 15 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves 73 million €146 million and cny 15 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 5 million 

 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted transactions forward contracts are not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic 815 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to short long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency all of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables receivables intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement 

 

 

 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

 

in 2009 we dedesignated the foreign currency exposure created by the eurodenominated term loan which is expected to offset the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and reducing our exposure to external counterparties 

 

commodity risk management 

 

we have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement of certain raw materials we manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements multiyear purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase agreements we regularly assess our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity requirements under forward purchase agreements and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in market conditions forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity for qualifying contracts we have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of fasb asc topic 815 based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that we would not settle net and the transaction would settle by physical delivery of the commodity as such realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract 

 

in addition we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy source typically these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting these instruments are marked to market at each reporting period and gains losses are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations we recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 as of december 31 2010 we did not have any open financial derivative contracts for commodities

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the company internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected 

 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010 kpmg llp has audited this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting its report is included below

celanese corporation 

 

we have audited celanese corporation and subsidiaries’ the “company” internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion celanese corporation and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of celanese corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 and our report dated february 11 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

some of the markets in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

 

recent declines in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit and volatility in the capital and credit markets have adversely affected the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners in particular we are exposed to risks associated with reduced levels of automotive and textile production and declines in the housing market these conditions have resulted in financial instability or other adverse effects at many of our suppliers customers or business partners the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays or interruptions of the supply of raw 

materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors the continuation of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

 

during 2008 and 2009 as a result of the economic downturn lenders and institutional investors reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers reducing the availability of liquidity and credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide although the markets have stabilized since 2008 future disruption of the credit markets could adversely affect our customer’s access to credit which supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses worldwide and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions payment delays or defaults by our customers 

 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations 

 

we operate in the global market and have customers in many countries we have major facilities primarily located in north america europe and asia and hold interests in ventures that operate in the us germany china japan south korea taiwan and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

 

in addition to the worldwide economic downturn conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics weather or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere 

 

moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states german or european union “eu” governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this region’s growth has slowed and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene and methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally formaldehyde acetic acid and vam we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our business segments we also purchase significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of such item and may increase significantly as a result of production disruptions or strikes for example the unplanned shutdown of our clear lake texas facility during 2007 together with other tight supply conditions caused a shortage of acetic acid and increased the price for such product 

 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene wood pulp electricity and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 

 19 

 

  

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs or if such commodities were unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

 

our operating results especially in our consumer specialties and advanced engineered materials segments depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

 

recent federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could if passed into law require us to relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

regulations have recently been issued by the us department of homeland security “dhs” aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we have registered certain of our sites with dhs in accordance with these regulations and are conducting vulnerability assessments for our sites and until that is done we cannot state with certainty the costs associated with any security plans that dhs may require these regulations may be revised further and additional legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic it is possible that such future legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to us we cannot predict the final form of currently pending legislation or other related legislation that may be passed and can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a future reporting period 

 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these obligations include the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” and the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 “rcra” related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters including cercla and rcra we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate them we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement 

policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present consequently compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities which could cause our business and operating results to be less favorable than expected an adverse outcome in these claim procedures may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products 

 

in june 2009 the california office of environmental health hazard assessment “oehha” formally proposed to list vinyl acetate monomer “vam” along with 11 other substances to a list of chemicals “known to the state of california” to cause cancer oehha is required to maintain this list under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 “proposition 65” celanese filed comments in opposition to the proposed listing because the listing was not based on a scientific review of the relevant data and the legal standard for adding vam to the proposition 65 list had not been met celanese also filed an action in the sacramento county supervisor court seeking declaration that oehha’s proposed listing of vam would be contrary to law the superior court granted celanese’s request for relief it is anticipated that oehha will appeal that decision 

 

we can provide no assurance that the sacramento county superior court decision will be affirmed on appeal or that vam or other chemicals we produce will not be classified in other jurisdictions in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products 

 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer “iarc” a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans in october 2009 iarc also concluded based on a recent study that there is sufficient evidence for a casual association between formaldehyde and the development of leukemia we expect the results of iarc’s review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements 

 

other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and expected modifications to the toxic substances control act tsca in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach 

 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation regulation and international accords 

 

greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international national regional state and local attention cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the eu similarly numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress which could adversely impact all industries in addition future regulation of greenhouse gas could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations statutory or regulatory changes under the clean air act or new climate change legislation 

while not all are likely to become law this is a strong indication that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices and establishing costly emissions trading schemes and requiring modification of equipment 

 

a step toward potential federal restriction on greenhouse gas emissions was taken on december 7 2009 when the environmental protection agency “epa” issued its endangerment finding in response to a decision of the supreme court of the united states the epa found that the emission of six greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare based on this finding the epa defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be “air pollution” subject to regulation under the clean air act although the epa has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing clean air act many sources of greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated without the need for further legislation 

 

the us congress is considering legislation that would create an economywide “capandtrade” system that would establish a limit or cap on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase and sale of emissions permits or “allowances” under the leading capandtrade proposals before congress the chemical industry likely would be affected due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances which they would be required to obtain to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the company or its energy suppliers in addition capandtrade proposals would likely increase the cost of energy including purchases of steam and electricity and certain raw materials used by the company other countries are also considering or have implemented “capandtrade” systems future environmental regulatory developments related to climate change are possible which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands 

 

a disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers for example during 2007 production was disrupted for an extended period of time at our clear lake texas facility that produces primarily acetic acid and vam the disruption was caused by an unplanned outage of our acetic acid unit because of this disruption the volumes of our acetyl intermediates segment were lower than we had expected for 2007 as we were unable to fully offset the lost production similar outages could occur in the future from unexpected disruptions at any of our other manufacturing facilities of key products such outages could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future reporting periods 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings below 

 

we may experience unexpected difficulties and incur unexpected costs in the relocation of our ticona plant from kelsterbach to the rhine main area which may increase our costs delay the transition or disrupt our ability to supply our customers 

 

we have agreed with frankfurt germany airport “fraport” to relocate our kelsterbach germany business resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned frankfurt airport expansion as a result of the settlement we will transition ticona’s operations from kelsterbach to another location in germany by mid2011 in july 2007 we announced that we would relocate the kelsterbach germany business to the hoechst industrial park in the rhine main area over a fiveyear period fraport agreed to pay ticona a total of €670 million to offset the costs associated with the transition of the business from its current location and the closure of the kelsterbach plant while the settlement and related payment amount was meant to be costneutral and represent the amount required to select a site build new production facilities demolish old production facilities and transition business activities according to schedule and without any disruptions to customer supply we may encounter unexpected costs or other difficulties during the relocation process that bring the total costs of the relocation to an amount greater than the compensation provided by fraport the relocation of these facilities represents a major logistical undertaking and we may have underestimated the amount that will be required to carry out every aspect of the relocation we may lose the services of valuable experienced employees during the transition if they decide not to work at the new location the construction of the new facilities may not be complete on time or may face cost overruns if our costs relating to the relocation exceed the amount of payments from fraport or if the relocation causes other unexpected difficulties our expenses may increase or supplies to our customers may be disrupted 

 

if supply to our customers is disrupted for an extended period this could negatively impact the reputation of this business and result in the loss of customers such effects could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods 

 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

 

because we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary’s functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial 

condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness 

 

we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets during 2008 the value of our plan assets declined significantly due to the decline in the overall equity markets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented to minimize the influence of liability volatility due to interest rate movements similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years if the value of our pension fund’s portfolio declines or does not perform as expected or if our experience with the fund leads us to change our assumptions regarding the fund we may be required to contribute additional capital to the fund 

 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

 

we attach great importance to our patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing we also license patents and other technology from third parties our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover processes products intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce if we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent license trademark or other intellectual property rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 

provisions in certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any shareholders’ rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

 

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with 

voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock 

 

risks related to the acquisition of celanese gmbh formerly celanese ag 

 

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement “domination agreement” andor the compensation paid in connection with the squeezeout may be increased which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

several minority shareholders of celanese gmbh have initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination agreement on december 12 2006 the frankfurt district court appointed an expert to help determine the value of celanese ag as of july 31 2004 on which date an extraordinary shareholder meeting of celanese ag was held to resolve the domination agreement as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment could be increased by the court and the purchaser would be required to make such payments within two months after the publication of the court’s ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to us and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the company also received applications for the commencement of award proceedings filed by 79 shareholders against the purchaser with the frankfurt district court requesting the court to set a higher amount for the squeezeout compensation should the court set a higher value for the squeezeout compensation former celanese ag shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of celanese ag due to the squeezeout are entitled pursuant to a settlement agreement between the purchaser and certain former celanese ag shareholders to claim for their shares the higher of the compensation amounts determined by the court in these different proceedings previously received compensation for their shares will be offset so that those shareholders who ceased to be shareholders of celanese ag due to the squeezeout are not entitled to more than higher of the amount set in the two court proceedings 

 

the purchaser may be required to compensate celanese gmbh for annual losses which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

under the domination agreement the purchaser is required among other things to compensate celanese gmbh for any annual loss incurred determined in accordance with german accounting requirements by celanese gmbh at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred this obligation to compensate celanese gmbh for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the domination agreement if celanese gmbh incurs losses during any period of the operative term of the domination agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of celanese gmbh at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to celanese gmbh to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of celanese gmbh during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to celanese gmbh by offsetting against such loss compensation claims by celanese gmbh any valuable counterclaims against celanese gmbh that the purchaser may have if the purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to celanese gmbh to cover an annual loss we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of celanese gmbh the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements since the domination agreement has been terminated effective as of december 31 2009 there will be no obligation by the purchaser to compensate celanese gmbh for any losses incurred after december 31 2009 

we and two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with respect to the purchaser’s obligation under the domination agreement and intercompany indebtedness to celanese gmbh which may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

our subsidiaries celanese international holdings luxembourg sà rl “cih” formerly celanese caylux holdings luxembourg sca and celanese us have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing so that the purchaser is at all times in a position to completely meet its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement in addition celanese has guaranteed i that the purchaser will meet its obligation under the domination agreement to compensate celanese gmbh for any annual loss incurred by celanese gmbh during the term of the domination agreement and ii the repayment of all existing intercompany indebtedness of celanese’s subsidiaries to celanese gmbh further under the terms of celanese’s guarantee in certain limited circumstances celanese gmbh may be entitled to require the immediate repayment of some or all of the intercompany indebtedness owed by celanese’s subsidiaries to celanese gmbh if cih andor celanese us are obligated to make payments under their obligations to the purchaser or celanese gmbh as the case may be or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to celanese gmbh is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due since the domination agreement has been terminated effective as of december 31 2009 there will be no obligation by the purchaser to compensate celanese gmbh for any losses incurred after december 31 2009 and our subsidiaries will be released from their obligations 

 

risks related to our indebtedness 

 

see also item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — debt and other obligations 

 

our level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

 

our total indebtedness is approximately 35 billion as of december 31 2009 

 

our debt could have important consequences including 

 

• increasing vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions including exacerbating any adverse business effects that are determined to be material adverse effects under our senior credit facility 

 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest 

 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

 

• limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt 

 

a breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and due to crossdefault provisions could result in a default under our senior credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral if any granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the lenders under the senior credit facility were to accelerate the payment of the indebtedness there is no guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness 

moreover the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future if new debt including amounts available under our senior credit agreement is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify see also item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — debt and other obligations 

 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results 

 

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase net of the impacts of hedges in place as of december 31 2009 we had 22 billion €440 million and cny 14 billion of variable rate debt of which 16 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves 643 million €290 million and cny 14 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 13 million 

 

our senior credit agreement consists of 2280 million of us dollar denominated and €400 million of euro denominated term loans due 2014 a 600 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a 228 million creditlinked revolving facility terminating in 2014 borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on libor for us dollars or euribor for euros as applicable or for us dollar denominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for the term loans and any loans under the creditlinked revolving facility is 175 subject to potential reductions as defined in the new senior credit agreement the term loans under the senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1 of the initial principal amount per annum payable quarterly commencing in july 2007 the remaining principal amount of the term loans will be due on april 2 2014 

 

an increase in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and cash flows see also item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — interest rate risk management 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

 

our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand receipt of additional capital including possible additional borrowings and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of distributions advances or cash payments 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

the senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement limit our ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase capital 

stock or make other restricted payments make investments and sell certain assets such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders in order to take certain actions recent disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents from our lenders our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

 

in addition the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit agreement upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit agreement the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior credit agreement if the lenders under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the senior credit agreement as well as their other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock 

 

the terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of celanese holdings llc and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us 

 

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries however the terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of celanese holdings llc and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us accordingly our ability to pay dividends on our stock is similarly limited

summary of consolidated results — year ended december 31 2009 compared with year ended december 31 2008 

 

the challenging economic environment in the united states and europe during the second half of 2008 continued throughout 2009 net sales declined in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of decreased demand due to the significant weakness of the global economy in july 2009 we completed the sale of our pvoh business which also contributed to the declines in our sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2009 we began to see a gradual recovery in the global economy with increasing demand within some of our business segments a decrease in selling prices was also a significant factor on the decrease in net sales decreases in key raw material and energy costs were the primary factors in lower selling prices a slightly unfavorable foreign currency impact also contributed to the decrease in net sales 

gross profit declined due to lower net sales as a percentage of sales gross profit increased as lower raw material and energy costs more than offset decreases in net sales during the period in 2010 we expect raw material and energy costs to increase which will partially be offset by increases in selling prices 

 

other charges gains net increased 28 million during 2009 as compared to 2008 

 

 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we began efforts to align production capacity and staffing levels with our view of an economic environment of prolonged lower demand for the year ended december 31 2009 other charges included employee termination benefits of 40 million related to this endeavor as a result of the shutdown of the vinyl acetate monomer “vam” production unit in cangrejera mexico we recognized employee termination benefits of 1 million and longlived asset impairment losses of 1 million during the year ended december 31 2009 the vam production unit in cangrejera mexico is included in our acetyl intermediates segment 

 

as a result of the project of closure at our pardies france facility other charges included exit costs of 89 million during the year ended december 31 2009 which consisted of 60 million in employee termination benefits 17 million of contract termination costs and 12 million of longlived asset impairment losses the pardies france facility is included in the acetyl intermediates segment 

 

due to continued declines in demand in automotive and electronic sectors we announced plans to reduce capacity by ceasing polyester polymer production at our ticona manufacturing plant in shelby north carolina other charges for the year ended december 31 2009 included employee termination benefits of 2 million and longlived asset impairment losses of 1 million related to this event the shelby north carolina facility is included in the advanced engineered materials segment 

 

other charges for the year ended december 31 2009 was partially offset by 6 million of insurance recoveries in satisfaction of claims we made related to the unplanned outage of our clear lake texas acetic acid facility during 2007 a 9 million decrease in legal reserves for plumbing claims due to the company’s ongoing assessment of the likely outcome of the plumbing actions and the expiration of the statute of limitation 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased during 2009 primarily due to business optimization and finance improvement initiatives 

 

operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher other charges partially offset by lower selling general and administrative costs 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased slightly during 2009 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand 

 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2009 was 101 compared to 15 for the year ended december 31 2008 our effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by the release of the us valuation allowance partially offset by lower earnings in jurisdictions participating in tax holidays increases in valuation allowances on certain foreign net deferred tax assets and the effect of new tax legislation in mexico 

summary of consolidated results — year ended december 31 2008 compared with year ended december 31 2007 

 

the challenging economic environment in the united states and europe during the first half of 2008 resulted in higher raw material and energy costs which enabled price increase initiatives across all business segments during the second half of 2008 the us credit crisis accelerated the economic slowdown and its spread to other regions of the world despite the halt in demand we were able to maintain the majority of our enacted price increases through the remainder of 2008 as a result increased prices improved net sales by 8 favorable foreign currency impacts also had a positive impact on net sales of 3 

 

net sales declined 5 due to decreased volumes lower volumes were primarily a result of decreased demand stemming from the global economic downturn as demand declined particularly during the fourth quarter of 2008 our customers began destocking to reduce their inventory levels in response we aggressively managed our global production capacity to align with the current environment decreased volumes in our acetate flake and tow businesses were not significantly impacted by the economic downturn rather decreased flake volumes were the result of our strategic decision to shift our flake production to our china ventures which we account for as cost investments 

 

gross profit declined as higher raw material energy and freight costs more than offset increases in net sales during the period the uncertain economic environment resulted in higher natural gas ethylene methanol and other commodity prices during the first nine months of the year our freight costs also increased primarily due to increased rates driven by higher energy prices late in 2008 raw material and energy prices declined 

 

other charges gains net increased 50 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

 

 

other charges increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and includes a longlived asset impairment loss of 92 million in connection with the 2009 closure of our acetic acid and vam production facility in pardies france our vam production unit in cangrejera mexico and the potential closure of certain other facilities this capacity reduction was necessitated by the significant change in the global economic environment and anticipated lower customer demand following the initial assessment of this capacity reduction we shut down the cangrejera vam production unit in february 2009 

 

in addition we recognized 23 million of longlived asset impairment losses and 13 million of employee termination benefits in 2008 related to the shutdown of our pampa texas facility 

 

during 2007 we fully impaired 6 million of goodwill related to our pvoh business 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 24 million during 2008 primarily due to business optimization and finance improvement initiatives 

operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher other charges and selling general and administrative costs the absence of a 34 million gain on the sale of our edmonton alberta canada facility during 2007 also contributed to lower operating profit in 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 28 million during 2008 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw material and energy costs and decreased demand our effective income tax rate for 2008 was 15 compared to 25 in 2007 the effective income tax rate decreased in 2008 due to 1 a decrease in the valuation allowance 2 tax credits generated on foreign jurisdictions and 3 the us tax impact of foreign operations 

 

the loss from discontinued operations of 90 million during 2008 primarily relates to a legal settlement agreement we entered into during 2008 under the settlement agreement we agreed to pay 107 million to resolve certain legacy items because the legal proceeding related to sales by the polyester staple fibers business which hoechst ag sold to kosa inc in 1998 the impact of the settlement is reflected within discontinued operations in the current period see the “polyester staple antitrust litigation” section in note 24 of the consolidated financial statements 

selected data by business segment — 2009 compared with 2008 and 2008 compared with 2007 

 

 

factors affecting business segment net sales 

 

the table below sets forth the percentage increase decrease in net sales for the years ended december 31 attributable to each of the factors indicated for the following business segments 

 

 

 

 

  

summary by business segment — year ended december 31 2009 compared with year ended december 31 2008 

 

advanced engineered materials 

 

 

 

our advanced engineered materials segment develops produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical polymers for application in automotive and electronics products as well as other consumer and industrial applications together with our strategic affiliates we are a leading participant in the global technical polymers industry the primary products of advanced engineered materials are polyacetal products “pom” polyphenylene sulfide “pps” long fiber reinforced thermoplastics “lfrt” polybutylene terephthalate “pbt” polyethylene terephthalate “pet” gur ® and liquid crystal polymers “lcp” pom pps lfrt pbt and pet are used in a broad range of products including automotive components electronics appliances and industrial applications gur ® is used in battery separators conveyor belts filtration equipment coatings and medical devices primary end markets for lcp are electrical and electronics 

 

net sales decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes significant weakness in the global economy experienced during the first half of the year resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for 

automotive electrical and electronic products as well as for other industrial products as a result sales volumes dropped significantly across all product lines during the second half of 2009 we experienced a continued increase in demand compared with the first half of the year as a result of programs like “cash for clunkers” in the united states during the third quarter of 2009 and a gradual recovery in the global economy during the fourth quarter of 2009 demand for the first quarter of 2010 is expected to see continued improvement due to seasonality with production being reduced in many areas in december due to the holidays and continued improvement in the global economy 

 

operating profit increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 lower raw material and energy costs and decreased overall spending more than offset the decline in net sales decreased overall spending was the result of our fixed spending reduction efforts noncapital spending incurred on the relocation of our ticona kelsterbach plant was flat compared to 2008 for more information regarding the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax was down due to a drop in equity in net earnings of affiliates as compared to 2008 equity in net earnings of affiliates was lower in 2009 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from decreased demand and a biennial shutdown at one of our affiliate’s plants 

 

consumer specialties 

 

 

 

our consumer specialties segment consists of our acetate products and nutrinova businesses our acetate products business primarily produces and supplies acetate tow which is used in the production of filter products we also produce acetate flake which is processed into acetate fiber in the form of a tow band our nutrinova business produces and sells sunett ®  a high intensity sweetener and food protection ingredients such as sorbates for the food beverage and pharmaceuticals industries 

 

net sales decreased 71 million during 2009 when compared with 2008 the decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased volume due to softening demand largely in tow with less significant decreases experienced in flake decreased volumes were primarily due to weakness in underlying demand resulting from the global economic downturn the decrease in volume was partially offset by an increase in selling prices a slightly unfavorable foreign currency impact also contributed to the decrease in net sales 

 

operating profit increased from 190 million in 2008 to 231 million in 2009 fixed cost reduction efforts improved energy costs and a favorable currency impact on costs had a significant impact on the increase to operating profit 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax of 288 million increased from 2008 primarily due to the increase in operating profit and an increase in dividends from our china ventures of 9 million increased dividends are the result of increased volumes and higher prices as well as efficiency improvements 

industrial specialties 

 

 

 

our industrial specialties segment includes our emulsions pvoh and eva performance polymers businesses our emulsions business is a global leader which produces a broad range of products specializing in vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and is a recognized authority on low volatile organic compounds “voc” an environmentallyfriendly technology as a global leader our pvoh business produced a broad portfolio of performance pvoh chemicals engineered to meet specific customer requirements our emulsions and pvoh products are used in a wide array of applications including paints and coatings adhesives construction glass fiber textiles and paper eva performance polymers offers a complete line of lowdensity polyethylene and specialty ethylene vinyl acetate resins and compounds eva performance polymers’ products are used in many applications including flexible packaging films lamination film products hot melt adhesives medical tubing automotive carpeting and solar cell encapsulation films 

 

in july 2009 we completed the sale of our pvoh business to sekisui chemical co ltd “sekisui” for a net cash purchase price of 168 million the transaction resulted in a gain on disposition of 34 million and includes longterm supply agreements between sekisui and celanese 

 

net sales declined 432 million during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the sale of our pvoh business and lower demand due to the economic downturn the decline in our emulsions volumes was concentrated in north america and europe offset partially by volume increases in asia eva performance polymers’ volumes declined due to the impact of the force majeure event at our edmonton alberta canada plant which is offset in other charges in our other activities segment repairs to the plant were completed at the end of the second quarter 2009 and normal operations have resumed net sales were also down from prior year as a result of decreases in key raw material costs resulting in lower selling prices unfavorable currency impacts also contributed to the decline in net sales during the year 

 

operating profit increased 42 million in 2009 compared to 2008 as decreases in volume and selling prices were more than offset by lower raw material and energy costs and reduced overall spending reduced spending is attributable to our fixed spending reduction efforts restructuring efficiencies and favorable foreign currency impacts on costs energy is favorable due to lower natural gas costs and lower usage resulting from a decline in volumes our eva performance polymers business contributed to the increase in other charges gains net as a result of receiving 10 million in insurance recoveries in partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the force majeure event at our edmonton alberta canada plant the gain on the sale of our pvoh business of 34 million had a significant impact to the increase in operating profit deprecation and amortization also had a favorable impact on operating profit due to the pvoh divestiture and the shutdown of our warrington uk emulsions facility 

acetyl intermediates 

 

 

 

our acetyl intermediates segment produces and supplies acetyl products including acetic acid vam acetic anhydride and acetate esters these products are generally used as starting materials for colorants paints adhesives coatings textiles medicines and more other chemicals produced in this business segment are organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical products to meet the growing demand for acetic acid in china and ongoing site optimization efforts we successfully expanded our acetic acid unit in nanjing china from 600000 tons per reactor annually to 12 million tons per reactor annually using new aoplus ® 2 capability the acetic acid unit could be further expanded to 15 million tons per reactor annually with only modest additional capital 

 

net sales decreased 33 during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower selling prices across all regions and major product lines lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts lower volumes were driven by a reduction in underlying demand in europe and in the americas which was only partially offset by significant increases in demand in asia lower pricing was driven by lower raw material and energy prices which also negatively impacted our formulabased pricing arrangements for vam in the us there were a number of production issues in asia among the major acetic acid producers other than celanese which coupled with planned outages caused periodic and shortterm market tightness in 2010 sales are expected to see increases as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year as the global economy begins to slowly recover sales volumes for the first quarter of 2010 are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2009 as expected improvements in demand in the us are partially offset by expected reductions in asia due to seasonal demand reductions for the chinese new year 

 

operating profit declined 214 million primarily as a result of lower prices across all regions and major product lines significantly lower realized pricing was partially offset by favorable raw material and energy prices reduced spending due to the shutdown of our pampa texas facility and other reductions in fixed spending depreciation and amortization expense declined primarily as a result of the longlived asset impairment losses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to our acetic acid and vam production facility in pardies france the closure of our vam production unit in cangrejera mexico in february 2009 together with lower depreciation expense resulting from the shutdown of our pampa texas facility other charges negatively impacted our operating profit by increasing 13 million from prior year which relates primarily to the planned shutdown of our pardies france facility margins are expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to increasing competition and expected increases in raw material costs 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax differs from operating profit primarily as a result of dividend income from our cost investment national methanol co “ibn sina” dividend income from ibn sina declined to 41 million in 2009 as a result of lower earnings from declining margins for methanol and methyl tertiarybutyl ether “mtbe”

other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including financing and administrative activities and our captive insurance companies 

 

net sales remained flat in 2009 as compared to 2008 we do not expect thirdparty revenues from our captive insurance companies to increase significantly in the near future 

 

the operating loss for other activities increased from an operating loss of 138 million in 2008 to an operating loss of 160 million in 2009 the increase was primarily related to higher other charges the increase in other charges was related to insurance retention costs as a result of our force majeure event at our edmonton alberta canada plant which is offset in our industrial specialties segment and severance costs as a result of business optimization and finance improvement initiatives the increase in other charges was partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to our fixed spending reduction efforts and restructuring efficiencies 

 

the loss from continuing operations before tax decreased 11 million in 2009 compared to 2008 this decrease was primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on our senior credit facilities and favorable currency impact 

 

summary by business segment — year ended december 31 2008 compared with year ended december 31 2007 

 

advanced engineered materials 

 

 

 

advanced engineered materials’ net sales increased 3 during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of implemented pricing increases combined with favorable foreign currency impacts increases in net sales were partially offset by lower volumes due to significant weakness in the us and european automotive and housing industries extended plant shutdowns enacted by major car manufacturers during the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed significantly to the volume decline 

 

operating profit declined 101 million primarily due to higher raw material freight and energy costs raw material costs increased on higher prices while freight costs increased as a result of increased freight rates and larger shipments to asia raw material costs declined late in 2008 though at year end we held highercost inventories while inventory destocking continued higher depreciation and amortization expense and increased other charges also contributed to lower operating profit depreciation and amortization expense are higher in 2008 due to the startup of the gur ® and lfrt units in asia other charges consist primarily of a 16 million longlived asset impairment loss related to certain advanced engineered materials’ facilities and 12 million related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

earnings from continuing operations before tax decreased due to decreased operating profit and decreased equity in net earnings of affiliates equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 18 million during 2008 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw material and energy costs and decreased demand 

 

consumer specialties 

 

 

 

consumer specialties’ net sales increased 4 to 1155 million during the year ended december 31 2008 driven primarily by pricing actions in our acetate products business and an additional month of sales from our apl acquisition which was acquired on january 31 2007 offset by lower volumes lower volumes are a direct result of our strategic decision to shift acetate flake production to our china ventures which are accounted for as cost method investments the full impact of this shift has been realized during 2008 and thus the resulting trend of diminishing volumes is not expected to continue lower flake volumes were partially offset by a 5 increase in tow volumes as we were able to capture a portion of the growth in global tow demand 

 

the increase in net sales due to higher sales prices during 2008 was offset most significantly by higher energy costs and to a lesser extent higher raw material and freight costs operating profit as compared to 2007 declined primarily due to the absence of a 22 million gain on the sale of our edmonton alberta canada facility in 2007 other charges during 2007 includes 3 million of deferred compensation plan expenses and 5 million of other restructuring charges offset by insurance recoveries of 5 million in partial satisfaction of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax of 237 million increased from 2007 as increased dividends from our china ventures more than offset the decline in operating profit increased dividends are the result of increased volumes and higher prices as well as efficiency improvements 

industrial specialties 

 

 

 

industrial specialties’ net sales increased by 4 during 2008 as increased prices and favorable foreign currency impacts more than offset volume reductions pricing actions implemented by all business lines late in 2007 and during 2008 contributed to the increase in net sales volumes declined primarily on decreased demand across all regions due to the global economic downturn combined with the temporary shutdown of our eva performance polymers plant late in 2008 the overall volume decline was partially offset by increased emulsions volumes at our nanjing china facility which began operating late in 2008 

 

increased net sales were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs during 2008 the 19 million increase in operating profit was primarily due to lower other charges and the absence of the 7 million loss on the divestiture of our eva performance polymers’ films business in 2007 during 2007 we initiated a plan to simplify and optimize our emulsions and pvoh businesses to focus on technology and innovation other charges during 2008 includes a charge of 3 million for employee termination benefits and accelerated depreciation related to this plan other charges during 2007 includes a charge of 14 million for employee termination benefits 3 million for an impairment of longlived assets and 5 million of accelerated depreciation expense for our shuttered united kingdom plant related to this plan other charges in 2007 also include 6 million of goodwill impairment and receipt of 7 million in insurance recoveries in partial satisfaction of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility 

 

acetyl intermediates 

 

 

acetyl intermediates’ net sales increased by 7 during 2008 primarily due to increased prices and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by lower volumes our formulabased pricing arrangements benefited from higher ethylene and methanol costs during the first nine months of 2008 market tightness in the americas and favorable foreign currency impacts in europe also contributed to the increase in net sales reduced volumes offset the increase in net sales as the slowdown of the global economy caused customers to slow production and diminish current inventory levels particularly in asia during the fourth quarter ethylene and methanol prices decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 on slowed global demand 

 

operating profit declined 307 million primarily as a result of higher ethylene methanol and energy prices increased other charges increased depreciation and amortization and the absence of a 12 million gain on the sale of our edmonton alberta canada facility in 2007 other charges increased during 2008 partially due to 76 million of longlived asset impairment losses recognized in 2008 related to the closure of our acetic acid and vam production facility in pardies france our vam production unit in cangrejera mexico which we shut down effective february 2009 and the potential shutdown of certain other facilities other charges in 2008 also includes 23 million of longlived asset impairment losses and 13 million of severance and retention charges related to the shutdown of our pampa texas facility also contributing to the increase was the absence of a onetime payment of 31 million received in 2007 in resolution of commercial disputes with a vendor and a 25 million decrease in insurance recoveries received in partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility increased depreciation and amortization expense during 2008 is the result of accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of our pampa texas facility and a full year of depreciation for our acetic acid plant in nanjing china which started up in mid2007 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax differs from operating profit primarily as a result of dividend income from our cost investment national methanol co “ibn sina” increased dividend income of 41 million during 2008 had a positive impact on earnings from continuing operations before tax ibn sina increased their dividends as a result of higher earnings from expanding margins for methanol and mtbe 

 

other activities 

 

net sales for other activities remained flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 we do not expect thirdparty revenues from our captive insurance companies to increase significantly in the near future 

 

the operating loss for other activities improved 90 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due to lower other charges partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses other charges decreased principally due to the release of reserves related to the sorbates antitrust actions settlement of 8 million and the absence of 59 million of deferred compensation plan costs which were incurred during 2007 selling general and administrative expenses increased due to additional spending on business optimization and finance improvement initiatives during 2008 

 

the loss from continuing operations before tax decreased 346 million during 2008 the significant decrease was primarily due to the absence of 256 million of refinancing costs incurred in 2007 and the decrease in the operating loss discussed above 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments in addition we have a 600 million revolving credit facility and 140 million available for borrowing under our creditlinked revolving facility to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations in excess of 20 lenders participate in our revolving credit facility each with a commitment of not more than 10 of the 600 million commitment 

 

while our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements including debt service in 2010 if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings reducing or delaying capital expenditures seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness there can be 

no assurance however that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

 

as a result of the pardies france project of closure we recorded exit costs of 89 million during the year ended december 31 2009 which included 60 million in employee termination benefits 17 million of contract termination costs and 12 million of longlived asset impairment losses to other charges gains net see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding other charges in addition we recorded 9 million of accelerated depreciation expense and 8 million of environmental remediation reserves for the year ended december 31 2009 related to the shutdown of the pardies france facility we may incur up to an additional 17 million in contingent employee termination benefits related to the pardies france project of closure we expect that substantially all of the exit costs except for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets will result in future cash expenditures over a twoyear period the pardies france facility is included in the acetyl intermediates segment refer to the acetyl intermediates section of the mda for more detail 

 

on a standalone basis celanese corporation has no material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries and no independent external operations of our own as such we generally depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations under our preferred stock our series a common stock and our senior credit agreement 

 

cash flows 

 

cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2009 were 1254 million which was an increase of 578 million from december 31 2008 cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2008 were 676 million which was a decrease of 149 million from december 31 2007 see below for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 and the change in cash and cash equivalents from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased 10 million to a cash inflow of 596 million in 2009 from a cash inflow of 586 million for the same period in 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by less cash paid for interest taxes and legal settlements coupled with a favorable change in trade working capital which helped to offset lower operating performance 

 

cash flow provided by operating activities increased 20 million to a cash inflow of 586 million in 2008 from a cash inflow of 566 million for the same period in 2007 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by positive trade working capital changes 202 million lower cash taxes paid 83 million and the absence of adjustments to cash for discontinued operations adjustments to cash for discontinued operations of 84 million during 2007 related primarily to working capital changes of the oxo products and derivatives businesses and the shutdown of our edmonton alberta canada methanol facility offsetting the increase in cash flows were an increase in net cash interest paid 78 million cash spent on legal settlements 134 million and decreased operating profit during the period 

 

net cash provided byused in investing activities 

 

net cash from investing activities increased from a cash outflow of 201 million in 2008 to a cash inflow of 31 million in 2009 net cash from investing activities increased primarily due to lower capital expenditures on property plant and equipment proceeds received from the sale of our pvoh business and increased deferred proceeds received on our ticona kelsterbach relocation these cash inflows were offset slightly by in increase on our capital expenditures related to our ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

 

net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow of 143 million in 2007 to a cash outflow of 201 million in 2008 net cash from investing activities decreased primarily due to cash spent in settlement of our cross currency swaps of 93 million see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements and the absence of proceeds from the sale of our oxo products and derivatives businesses during 2007 these amounts were offset by net cash received on the sale of marketable securities 111 million and the excess of cash received from fraport over amounts spent in connection with the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

our cash outflows for capital expenditures were 176 million 274 million and 288 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach capital expenditures were primarily related to major replacements of equipment capacity expansions major investments to reduce future operating costs and environmental health and safety initiatives cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 265 million in 2010 excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach 

 

as of december 31 2009 we have received €542 million of cash from fraport in connection with the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation per the terms of the fraport agreement we expect to receive an additional €110 million in 2011 subject to downward adjustments based on our readiness to close our operations at our kelsterbach germany facility we anticipate related cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2010 will be €200 million 

 

net cash used in financing activities 

 

net cash for financing activities decreased from a cash outflow of 499 million in 2008 to a cash outflow of 112 million in 2009 the 387 million decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily related to cash outflows attributable to the repurchase of shares during 2008 of 378 million as compared to no shares repurchased during 2009 

 

net cash for financing activities increased to a cash outflow of 499 million in 2008 compared to a cash outflow of 714 million during 2007 the increase primarily relates to the absence of cash outflows attributable to the debt refinancing in 2007 also contributing to the increase cash spent to repurchase shares was 25 million less during 2008 than during 2007 decreased cash received for stock option exercises of 51 million partially offset the increase 

 

in addition exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents increased to a favorable currency effect of 63 million in 2009 compared to an unfavorable impact of 35 million in 2008 and a favorable impact of 39 million in 2007 

 

debt and other obligations 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had total debt of 3501 million and cash and cash equivalents of 1254 million resulting in net debt of 2247 million a 610 million decrease from december 31 2008 increased cash of 578 million and net cash paydowns on debt of 89 million were partially offset by new capital lease obligations of 38 million and unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 24 million 

 

senior credit facilities 

 

our senior credit agreement consists of 2280 million of us dollardenominated and €400 million of eurodenominated term loans due 2014 a 600 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a 228 million creditlinked revolving facility terminating in 2014 as of december 31 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility accordingly 600 million remained available for borrowing as of december 31 2009 there were 88 million of letters of credit issued under the creditlinked revolving facility and 140 million remained available for borrowing our senior credit agreement requires us to not exceed a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility the first lien senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization subject to adjustments identified in the credit agreement see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our senior credit facilities 

 

on june 30 2009 we entered into an amendment to the senior credit agreement the amendment reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility from 650 million to 600 million and increased the first lien senior secured leverage ratio covenant that is applicable when any amount is outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the senior credit agreement prior to giving effect to the amendment the maximum first lien senior 

secured leverage ratio was 390 to 100 as amended the maximum senior secured leverage ratio for the following trailing fourquarter periods is as follows 

 

 

 

as a condition to borrowing funds or requesting that letters of credit be issued under the revolving credit facility our first lien senior secured leverage ratio as calculated as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered under the revolving facility cannot exceed a certain threshold as specified above further our first lien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility the first lien senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization subject to adjustment identified in the credit agreement 

 

based on the estimated first lien senior secured leverage ratio for the trailing four quarters at december 31 2009 our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is 600 million as of the quarter ended december 31 2009 we estimate our first lien senior secured leverage ratio to be 339 to 100 which would be 411 to 100 were the revolving credit facility fully drawn the maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio under the revolving credit facility for such quarter is 525 to 100 our availability in future periods will be based on the first lien senior secured leverage ratio applicable to the future periods 

 

our senior credit agreement also contains a number of restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries including but not limited to restrictions on their ability to incur indebtedness grant liens on assets merge consolidate or sell assets pay dividends or make other restricted payments make investments prepay or modify certain indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates enter into saleleaseback transactions or certain hedge transactions or engage in other businesses the senior credit agreement also contains a number of affirmative covenants and events of default including a cross default to other debt of certain of our subsidiaries in an aggregate amount equal to more than 40 million and the occurrence of a change of control failure to comply with these covenants or the occurrence of any other event of default could result in acceleration of the loans and other financial obligations under our senior credit agreement

please see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

 

we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 

• recoverability of longlived assets 

 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

 

we test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments where discrete financial information is available for our reporting units and operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management our business units have been designated as our reporting units based on business segment management’s review of and reliance on the business unit financial information and include advanced engineered materials acetate products nutrinova emulsions celanese eva performance polymers formerly at plastics and acetyl intermediates businesses we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value 

 

the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” the wacc considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of the reporting unit may exist if the recoverability test indicates potential impairment we calculate an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain 

longlived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing 

 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset the relief from royalty method estimates the company’s theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset key assumptions used in this model include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates royalty rates growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the wacc considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by thirdparty valuation consultants operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinitelived intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

 

for all significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying value of the asset by a substantial margin at the date of the most recent impairment test our methodology for determining impairment for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets was consistent with that used in the prior year 

 

recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

 

we assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of the asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived and amortizable intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group longlived and amortizable intangible assets are tested for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends and the remaining useful life of the asset projections of sales and profitability trends are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment these projections are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally when impairment is indicated a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used to value goodwill at the reporting unit level incorporating discount rates commensurate with risks associated with each asset is used to determine the fair value of the asset to measure potential impairment we believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value 

 

valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible amortizable intangible and longlived assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist us with this process specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and companyspecific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to the company’s assumptions to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 

• income taxes 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some 

portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide valuation allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us luxembourg france spain china the united kingdom and canada we have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in 2009 based on cumulative profitability the company concluded that the us valuation allowance should be reversed except for a portion related to certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are not likely to be realized 

 

we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 

 

the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment if actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset additionally the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities which may result in future taxes interest and penalties 

 

in december 2009 mexico enacted the 2010 mexican tax reform bill “tax reform bill” to be effective january 1 2010 under this new legislation the corporate income tax rate will be temporarily increased from 28 to 30 for 2010 through 2012 then reduced to 29 in 2013 and finally reduced back to 28 in 2014 and future years the tax reform bill as enacted accelerates this recapture period from 10 years to 5 years and effectively requires payment of taxes even if no benefit was obtained through the tax consolidation regime finally significant modifications were also made to the rules for income taxes previously deferred on intercompany dividends as well as to income taxes related to differences between consolidated and individual mexican tax earnings and profits the estimated income tax impact to the company of this new legislation at december 31 2009 is 73 million payable 12 million in 2010 14 million in 2012 12 million in 2013 and 35 million in 2014 and thereafter there is an expectation that mexico may publish technical corrections to certain aspects of the tax reform bill in 2010 that could significantly reduce the amounts due from the company as described above however there is no assurance that mexico will in fact publish such corrections nor is it clear what impact any corrections published will have on the company’s actual liability under the new law although any ultimate outcome is uncertain we strongly contend the new legislation is unconstitutional and we will contest its validity and effective date through proper channels 

 

  

we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the pension protection act of 2006 based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower 

withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 

 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2009 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us defined benefit pension plans which represent approximately 83 and 85 of our pension plan assets and liabilities respectively on average the actual return on the us qualified defined pension plans’ assets over the longterm 15 to 20 years has exceeded 85 

 

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 5 million in 2009 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2009 we decreased the discount rate to 590 from 650 as of december 31 2008 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in our discount rate will increase our annual pension expenses by an estimated 12 million and increase our benefit obligations by approximately 151 million for our us pension plans in addition the same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than 1 million and 9 million respectively for our us postretirement medical plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the nonus pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by approximately 1 million and less than 1 million respectively and will increase our benefit obligations by approximately 32 million and 2 million respectively 

 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the apbo as of december 31 2009 changing by approximately 4 million and 3 million respectively additionally increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the 2009 postretirement benefit cost changing by less than 1 million 

 

pension assumptions are reviewed annually on a plan and countryspecific basis by thirdparty actuaries and senior management such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook we determine the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested a single longterm expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the longterm expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan 

 

differences between actual rates of return of plan assets and the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets are generally not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs these differences are deferred and amortized into pension expense over the average remaining future service of employees we apply the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets to a marketrelated value of plan assets to stabilize variability in the plan asset values 

 

• accounting for commitments and contingencies 

 

we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including 

notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience with respect to environmental liabilities it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification “fasb asc” topic 450 contingencies and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risks 

 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging “fasb asc topic 815” 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate obligation these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

 

in march 2007 in anticipation of the april 2007 debt refinancing we entered into various us dollar and euro interest rate swap agreements which became effective on april 2 2007 with notional amounts of 16 billion and €150 million respectively the notional amount of the 16 billion us dollar interest rate swaps decreased by 400 million effective january 2 2008 and decreased by another 200 million effective january 2 2009 to offset the declines we entered into us dollar interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of 400 million which became effective on january 2 2008 and an additional us dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of 200 million which became effective april 2 2009 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had 22 billion €440 million and cny 14 billion of variable rate debt of which 16 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves 643 million €290 million and cny 14 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 13 million 

 

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted transactions forward contracts are not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic 815 

 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to short long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency all of the contracts included in the table below will 

have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables receivables intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement 

 

 

 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

 

to protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation we entered into cross currency swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004 the cross currency swaps and the eurodenominated portion of the senior term loan were designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation we dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the debt refinancing in april 2007 and redesignated the cross currency swaps and new senior euro term loan in july 2007 as a result we recorded 26 million of marktomarket losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior euro term loan during this period 

 

under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements we paid approximately €13 million in interest and received approximately 16 million in interest on june 15 and december 15 of each year the fair value of the net obligation under the cross currency swaps was included in current other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2007 upon maturity of the cross currency swap arrangements in june 2008 we owed €276 million 426 million and were owed 333 million in settlement of the obligation we paid 93 million net of interest of 3 million in june 2008 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we dedesignated €385 million of the €400 million eurodenominated portion of the term loan previously designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation the remaining €15 million eurodenominated portion of the term loan was dedesignated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation in june 2009 prior to these dedesignations we had been using external derivative contracts to offset foreign currency exposures on certain intercompany loans as a result of the dedesignations the foreign currency exposure created by the eurodenominated term loan is expected to offset the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and reducing our exposure to external counterparties 

 

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

commodity risk management 

 

we have exposure to the prices of commodities in our procurement of certain raw materials we manage our exposure primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements and derivative instruments we regularly assess 

our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity requirements forward and utilization of other raw material hedging instruments in addition to forward purchase contracts in accordance with changes in market conditions forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity for qualifying contracts we have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of fasb asc topic 815 as it was probable at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that they would not settle net and would result in physical delivery as such realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract 

 

in addition we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy source typically these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting these instruments are marked to market at each reporting period and gains losses are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations we recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 and less than 1 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as of december 31 2009 we did not have any open financial derivative contracts for commodities

these cost investments where we own greater than a 20 ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of accounting because we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities we determined that we 

cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities limitations on our involvement in the daytoday operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

 

other equity investments 

 

infraservs we hold ownership interests in several infraserv entities located in germany infraservs own and develop industrial parks and provide onsite general and administrative support to tenants the table below represents our equity investments in infraserv ventures as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and acetaldehyde although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier there cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year 

 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change our production facilities rely largely on fuel oil natural gas and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by one of our subsidiaries which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure through forward purchase contracts longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements during 2008 we did not enter into any commodity financial derivative contracts see note 2 and note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

we also currently purchase and lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the manufacture of acetyl intermediates products for precious metals the leases are distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product and are divided into several contracts 

 

research and development 

 

all of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness our businesses are innovationoriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications we consider the amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be adequate to drive our strategic initiatives 

 

intellectual property 

 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired we protect our trademarks vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate 

 

in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property 

protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor our competitors and vigorously challenge patent and trademark infringement for example acetyl intermediates maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent infringement matters in europe asia and the united states we are currently pursuing a number of matters relating to the infringement of our acetic acid patents some of our earlier acetic acid patents expired in 2007 other patent applications covering acetic acid are presently pending 

 

neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent trademark copyright or trade secret

environmental and other regulation 

 

matters pertaining to environmental and other regulations are discussed in item 1a risk factors item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 16 and note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 8350 employees worldwide from continuing operations compared to 8400 as of december 31 2007 this represents a decrease of less than 1 the following table sets forth the approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

many of our employees are unionized particularly in germany canada mexico brazil belgium and france however in the united states less than one quarter of our employees are unionized moreover in germany and france wages and general working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements within the limits established by these agreements our various subsidiaries negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations such as workers’ councils representing the employees collective bargaining agreements between the german chemical employers associations and unions relating to remuneration generally have a term of one year while in the united states a three year term for collective bargaining agreements is typical we offer comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory 

backlog 

 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

 

risks related to our business 

 

the worldwide economic downturn and difficult conditions in the global capital and credit markets have affected and may continue to adversely affect our business as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers which are cyclical in nature we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 

 

some of the markets in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

 

recent declines in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit and volatility in the capital and credit markets have adversely affected the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners in particular we are exposed to risks associated with the ongoing decline of the automotive textile and housing markets these conditions have resulted in financial instability or other adverse effects at many of our suppliers customers or business partners the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

 

moreover the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers continued disruption of the credit markets has affected and could continue to adversely affect our customer’s access to credit which supports the continuation 

and expansion of their businesses worldwide and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions payment delays or defaults by our customers 

 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations 

 

we operate in the global market and have customers in many countries we have major facilities primarily located in north america europe and asia and hold interests in ventures that operate in germany china japan south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

 

in addition to the worldwide economic downturn conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere 

 

moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states german or european union “eu” governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries this region’s growth has slowed and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene and methanol from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally formaldehyde acetic acid and vam we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our segments we also purchase significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of such item and may increase significantly as a result of production disruptions or strikes for example the unplanned shutdown of our clear lake texas facility together with other tight supply conditions caused a shortage of acetic acid and increased the price for such product during 2007 

 

we are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene wood pulp electricity and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 

  

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs or if such commodities were unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

 

our operating results especially in our consumer specialties and advanced engineered materials segments depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

 

recent federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could if passed into law require us to relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

regulations have recently been issued by the department of homeland security “dhs” aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we have registered certain of our sites with dhs in accordance with these regulations and are conducting vulnerability assessments for our sites and until that is done we cannot state with certainty the costs associated with any security plans that dhs may require these regulations may be revised further and additional legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic it is possible that such future legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to us we cannot predict the final form of currently pending legislation or other related legislation that may be passed and can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a future reporting period 

 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these include obligations related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between celanese gmbh and hoechst also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger 

 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” and the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 “rcra” we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate them we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present consequently compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities which could cause our business and operating results to be less favorable than expected 

we are also involved in several claims lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters an adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

 

changes in environmental health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products 

 

canada recently included vinyl acetate monomer “vam” as one of approximately 200 chemicals being assessed as part of the canadian government’s chemicals management plan under the canadian environmental protection act “cepa” on may 16 2008 health canada published a draft screening risk assessment and draft risk management scope document for vam that concluded using a ’precautionary approach’ that vam be listed as a “toxic substance” under cepa on january 27 2009 after consideration of data submitted by celanese and other manufacturers and users of vam and further consideration of a risk assessment prepared by the european union health canada published its final decision overruling its may 16 2008 draft assessment of vam health canada concluded that vam does not meet the regulatory requirements for being listed as a toxic substance under cepa 

 

the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” which established a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured in or imported to the european union became effective on june 1 2007 vam is one of the chemicals that the european chemicals agency “echa” will regulate under reach echa will likely rely on the work of the euworking group on classification and labeling of dangerous substances after extensive study the euworking group agreed that vam should be classified in the eu as showing limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect in addition a risk assessment was performed on vam by the european chemicals bureau of the european commission risk reduction strategies for human health and the environment were finalized without the imposition of any restrictions or burdens atypical to an industrial chemical the euworking group conclusion has been reviewed and substantively approved by eu scientific committee on health and environmental risks 

 

we can provide no assurance that the eu classifications on vam will not be revised in the future or that other chemicals we produce will not be classified in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products such negative classifications could have an adverse affect on our business and results of operations 

 

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer “iarc” a private research agency has reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans we expect the results of iarc’s review will be examined and considered by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements if such agencies give strong consideration to iarc’s findings in setting such standards and requirements it could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s chemical evaluation program high production volume chemical initiative and chemical assessment and management program “champ” in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as reach 

 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states canada and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands 

 

a disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers for example during 2007 production was disrupted for an extended period of time at our clear lake texas facility that produces primarily acetic acid and vam the disruption was caused by an unplanned outage of our acetic acid unit because of this disruption the volumes of our acetyl intermediates segment were lower than we had expected for 2007 as we were unable to fully offset the lost production similar outages could occur in the future from unexpected disruptions at any of our other manufacturing facilities of key products such outages could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future reporting periods 

 

we may experience unexpected difficulties in the relocation of our ticona plant from kelsterbach to the rhine main area which may increase our costs delay the transition or disrupt our ability to supply our customers 

 

we have agreed with frankfurt germany airport “fraport” to relocate our kelsterbach germany business resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned frankfurt airport expansion as a result of the settlement we will transition ticona’s operations from kelsterbach to another location in germany by mid2011 in july 2007 we announced that we would relocate the kelsterbach germany business to the hoechst industrial park in the rhine main area over a fiveyear period fraport agreed to pay ticona a total of €670 million to offset the costs associated with the transition of the business from its current location and the closure of the kelsterbach plant while the settlement and related payment amount are meant to be costneutral and represent the actual amount we will require to select a site build new production facilities demolish old production facilities and transition business activities according to schedule and without any disruptions to customer supply we may encounter unexpected costs or other difficulties during the relocation process that bring the total costs of the relocation to an amount greater than the compensation provided by fraport the relocation of these facilities represents a major logistical undertaking and we may have underestimated the amount that will be required to carry out every aspect of the relocation we may lose the services of valuable experienced employees during the transition if they decide not to work at the new location the construction of the new facilities may not be complete on time or may face cost overruns if our costs relating to the relocation exceed the amount of payments from fraport or if the relocation causes other unexpected difficulties our expenses may increase or supplies to our customers may be disrupted 

 

if supply to our customers is disrupted for an extended period this could negatively impact the reputation of this business and result in the loss of customers such effects could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

 

as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary’s functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness 

 

we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets during the previous fiscal year the value of our plan assets declined significantly due to the decline in the overall equity markets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented to minimize the influence of liability volatility due to interest rate movements similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years if the value of our pension fund’s portfolio declines or does not perform as expected or if our experience with the fund leads us to change our assumptions regarding the fund we may be required to contribute additional capital to the fund 

 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of 

coverage as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce if we are not successful in protecting our trademark or patent rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 

provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws as well as any shareholders’ rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

 

provisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock 

 

risks related to the acquisition of celanese gmbh formerly celanese ag 

 

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement “domination agreement” may be increased which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

several minority shareholders of celanese gmbh have initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination agreement on march 14 2005 the frankfurt district court dismissed on grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award proceedings in january 2006 the frankfurt higher district court ruled that the appeals were admissible and the proceedings will therefore continue on december 12 2006 the frankfurt district court appointed an expert to help determine the value of celanese gmbh as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment could be increased by the court and the purchaser would be required to make such payments within two months after the publication of the court’s ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to us and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the purchaser may be required to compensate celanese gmbh for annual losses which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

under the domination agreement the purchaser is required among other things to compensate celanese gmbh for any annual loss incurred determined in accordance with german accounting requirements by celanese gmbh at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred this obligation to compensate celanese gmbh for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the domination agreement if celanese gmbh incurs losses during any period of the operative term of the domination agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of celanese gmbh at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to celanese gmbh to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of celanese gmbh during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to celanese gmbh by offsetting against such loss compensation claims by celanese gmbh any valuable counterclaims against 

celanese gmbh that the purchaser may have if the purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to celanese gmbh to cover an annual loss we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of celanese gmbh the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we and two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with respect to the purchaser’s obligation under the domination agreement and intercompany indebtedness to celanese gmbh which may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

our subsidiaries celanese international holdings luxembourg sà rl “cih” formerly celanese caylux holdings luxembourg sca and celanese us have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing so that the purchaser is at all times in a position to completely meet its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement in addition celanese has guaranteed i that the purchaser will meet its obligation under the domination agreement to compensate celanese gmbh for any annual loss incurred by celanese gmbh during the term of the domination agreement and ii the repayment of all existing intercompany indebtedness of celanese’s subsidiaries to celanese gmbh further under the terms of celanese’s guarantee in certain limited circumstances celanese gmbh may be entitled to require the immediate repayment of some or all of the intercompany indebtedness owed by celanese’s subsidiaries to celanese gmbh if cih andor celanese us are obligated to make payments under their obligations to the purchaser or celanese gmbh as the case may be or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to celanese gmbh is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due 

 

risks related to our indebtedness 

 

see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — liquidity — contractual obligations” 

 

our level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

 

our total indebtedness is approximately 35 billion as of december 31 2008 

 

our debt could have important consequences including 

 

  

a breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and due to crossdefault provisions could result in a default under our senior credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral if any granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the lenders under the senior credit facility were to accelerate the payment of the indebtedness there is no guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness 

moreover the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future if new debt including amounts available under our senior credit agreement is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — liquidity — contractual obligations” 

 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results 

 

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase net of the impacts of hedges in place in april 2007 we through certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior credit agreement the new senior credit agreement consists of 2280 million of us dollar denominated and €400 million of euro denominated term loans due 2014 a 650 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a 228 million creditlinked revolving facility terminating in 2014 borrowings under the new senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on libor for us dollars or euribor for euros as applicable or for us dollar denominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for the term loans and any loans under the creditlinked revolving facility is 175 subject to potential reductions as defined in the new senior credit agreement the term loans under the new senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1 of the initial principal amount per annum payable quarterly commencing in july 2007 the remaining principal amount of the term loans will be due on april 2 2014 

 

an increase in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and cash flows see also “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — interest rate risk management” 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

 

our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand receipt of additional capital including possible additional borrowings and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of distributions advances or cash payments 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

the senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement limit our ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments make investments and sell certain assets such restrictions in our debt instruments could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders in order to take certain actions recent disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such 

consents from our lenders our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents 

 

in addition the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio no greater than 390 to 100 if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet this test at all 

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit agreement upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit agreement the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior credit agreement if the lenders under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the senior credit agreement as well as their other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock 

 

the terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us 

 

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries however the terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us accordingly our ability to pay dividends on our stock is similarly limited

dividend policy 

 

our board of directors adopted a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of our series a common stock at an annual rate of 016 per share unless our board of directors in its sole discretion determines otherwise pursuant to this policy we paid quarterly dividends of 004 per share on february 1 2008 may 1 2008 august 1 2008 and november 1 2008 and similar quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2007 the annual cash dividend declared and paid during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 were 24 million and 25 million respectively dividends payable to holders of our series a common stock cannot be declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside for the payment thereof unless we have paid or set aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of our preferred stock as described below our board of directors may at any time modify or revoke our dividend policy on our series a common stock 

 

we are required under the terms of the preferred stock to pay scheduled quarterly dividends subject to legally available funds for so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding 1 we will not declare pay or set apart funds for the payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to any junior stock or parity stock and 2 neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will subject to certain exceptions redeem purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise in each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of preferred stock and any parity stock for all preceding dividend periods pursuant to this policy we paid quarterly dividends of 0265625 per share on our 425 convertible perpetual preferred stock on february 1 2008 may 1 2008 august 1 2008 and november 1 2008 and similar quarterly dividends during each quarter of 2007 

on january 5 2009 we declared a cash dividend of 0265625 per share on our 425 convertible perpetual preferred stock amounting to 3 million and a cash dividend of 004 per share on its series a common stock amounting to 6 million both cash dividends are for the period november 1 2008 to january 31 2009 and were paid on february 1 2009 to holders of record as of january 15 2009

the amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted by our senior credit agreement any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

overview 

 

during 2008 we made significant strides in strengthening our competitive position as detailed below we advanced our expansion efforts in asia successfully generated cash and used it to deliver value for our shareholders settled legacy litigation matters carried out our sustainability commitments and fulfilled our role as a responsible corporate citizen 

 

2008 highlights 

 

 36 

 

  

during the first half of 2008 the us and europe began to experience challenging economic conditions that resulted in significant inflation in raw material and energy pricing despite the challenges we were able to implement higher pricing on continued strong demand and higher volumes associated with our growth strategy in asia all of which contributed to growth in net sales during the period 

 

during the second half of 2008 recessionary trends stemming from the us credit crisis quickly spread to other regions of the world this triggered an unexpected reduction in consumer and industrial demand that caused our customers to sharply lower their inventories during the last few months of the year as a result demand for our products declined dramatically and we aggressively managed our global production capacity to align with the current environment during this period of economic uncertainty we remained focused on executing our longterm strategy to increase the value of celanese 

 

2009 outlook 

 

we expect inventory destocking to diminish in 2009 but do not foresee a shortterm recovery in the global economic environment we expect earnings to improve from fourth quarter levels throughout the year as the impact of destocking and the negative effects of lowerofcost or market and firstin firstout inventory accounting decrease 

 

we are taking aggressive actions in response to the expected prolonged weak demand environment these actions include an assessment of our current manufacturing footprint and reductions of our overall fixed cost structure initial fixed cost reductions have been initiated and are estimated to result in between 100 million and 120 million of cost savings annually 

 

expansion in china 

 

the nanjing complex brings worldclass scale to one site for the production of acetic acid vam acetic anhydride emulsions celstran ® long fiber reinforced thermoplastic “lfrt” gur ®  vectra ® lcp and compounding we believe the nanjing complex will further enhance our capabilities to better meet the growing needs of our customers in a number of industries across asia 

 

the acetic acid facility located in our nanjing china complex achieved normal operations in june 2007 and we commenced production of vinyl acetate emulsions at the complex during the fourth quarter of 2007 during the 

first quarter of 2008 we commissioned the startup of our lfrt unit in nanjing our newly constructed 20000 ton gur ® facility 100000 ton acetic anhydride facility and 300000 ton vam facility started up during the third quarter of 2008 operations for the compounding plant at the complex are expected to begin during 2009 

 

in 2008 we announced our plans to build an lcp production facility at our nanjing complex construction for the lcp production facility and startup dates will depend on market conditions

summary of consolidated results — year ended december 31 2008 compared with year ended december 31 2007 

 

the challenging economic environment in the united states and europe during the first half of 2008 resulted in higher raw material and energy costs which enabled price increase initiatives across all segments during the second half of 2008 the us credit crisis accelerated the economic slowdown and its spread to other regions of the world despite the halt in demand we were able to maintain the majority of our enacted price increases through the 

remainder of 2008 as a result increased prices improved net sales by 8 favorable foreign currency impacts also had a positive impact on net sales of 3 

 

net sales declined 5 due to decreased volumes lower volumes were primarily a result of decreased demand stemming from the global economic downturn as demand declined particularly during the fourth quarter of 2008 our customers began destocking to reduce their inventory levels in response we aggressively managed our global production capacity to align with the current environment we expect destocking trends to continue to a lesser extent into the first quarter of 2009 decreased volumes in our acetate flake and tow businesses were not significantly impacted by the economic downturn rather decreased flake volumes were the result of our strategic decision to shift our flake production to our china ventures which we account for as cost investments the full impact of this shift has been realized during 2008 and thus the resulting trend of diminishing volumes is not expected to continue 

 

gross profit declined as higher raw material energy and freight costs more than offset increases in net sales during the period the uncertain economic environment resulted in higher natural gas ethylene methanol and other commodity prices during the first nine months of the year our freight costs also increased primarily due to increased rates driven by higher energy prices late in 2008 raw material and energy prices declined and we expect that decline to positively impact gross profit during the first quarter of 2009 

 

other charges gains net increased 50 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

other charges increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and includes a longlived asset impairment loss of 92 million in connection with the potential closure of our acetic acid and vam production facility in pardies france our vam production unit in cangrejera mexico and certain other facilities consideration of this potential capacity reduction was necessitated by the significant change in the global economic environment and anticipated lower customer demand following the initial assessment of this capacity reduction we determined we would shut down the cangrejera vam production unit effective at the end of february 2009 

 

in addition we recognized 23 million of longlived asset impairment losses and 13 million of employee termination benefits in 2008 related to the shutdown of our pampa texas facility 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 24 million during 2008 primarily due to business optimization and finance improvement initiatives 

 

operating profit decreased due to lower gross profit and higher other charges and selling general and administrative costs the absence of a 34 million gain on the sale of our edmonton alberta canada facility during 2007 also contributed to lower operating profit in 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 28 million during 2008 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw material and energy costs and decreased demand 

our effective income tax rate for 2008 was 15 compared to 25 in 2007 the effective income tax rate decreased in 2008 due to 1 a decrease in the valuation allowance 2 tax credits generated on foreign jurisdictions and 3 the us tax impact of foreign operations 

 

the loss from discontinued operations of 90 million during 2008 primarily relates to a legal settlement agreement we entered into during 2008 under the settlement agreement we agreed to pay 107 million to resolve certain legacy items because the legal proceeding related to sales by the polyester staple fibers business which hoechst ag sold to kosa inc in 1998 the impact of the settlement is reflected within discontinued operations in the current period see the “polyester staple antitrust litigation” section in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

summary of consolidated results — year ended december 31 2007 compared with year ended december 31 2006 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 net sales increased by 12 to 6444 million compared to the same period in 2006 as increases in pricing and favorable currency impacts more than offset lower overall volumes overall pricing contributed to a 6 increase in net sales primarily due to a tight global supply of acetyl pvoh and emulsion products and higher acetate tow and flake prices favorable currency impacts particularly related to the euro also contributed to a 4 increase in net sales and the acquisition of acetate products limited “apl” in 2007 increased net sales by 227 million strong volume increases due to increased market penetration from several of advanced engineered material’s key products and the successful startup of our acetic acid unit in nanjing china helped to partially offset the decreases in volumes in our acetyl intermediates and industrial specialties segments resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat for the year ended december 31 2007 224 compared to the same period in 2006 227 the slight decrease was primarily due to lower overall volumes and higher energy and raw material costs more than offsetting the higher overall prices and favorable currency impacts particularly related to the euro 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 20 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the absence of executive severance and legal costs associated with the squeezeout of 23 million and longterm incentive plan expenses of 20 million both recorded in 2006 selling general and administrative expenses also decreased 5 million due to lower stockbased compensation expenses during the year ended december 31 2007 the decreases were partially offset by 15 million of additional expenses related to finance improvement initiatives and 6 million related to the revised deferred compensation plan expenses

the net 128 million improvement in operating profit during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 is a result of higher net sales lower selling general and administrative expenses and a 34 million gain recorded on the sale of our edmonton alberta canada facility during 2007 offset by higher other charges as discussed above 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 8 in the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 due primarily to improved performance from our infraserv affiliates 

 

interest expense decreased 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 the decrease was primarily related to lower interest rates on the new senior credit agreement compared to the interest rates on the senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes which were repaid in april 2007 in conjunction with the debt refinancing see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to additional china financing activities in 2007 

 

refinancing expenses incurred during 2007 related to our debt refinancing as a result of the refinancing we expensed 207 million of premiums paid on early redemption of debt in addition we expensed 33 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums related to the former 2454 million senior credit facility senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes and 16 million of debt issuance and other refinancing expenses 

 

income tax expense decreased by 93 million to 110 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 was 25 which is less than the combined us federal and state statutory rate of 39 the effective tax rate for 2007 was favorably impacted by 1 an increase in unrepatriated lowtaxed earnings including tax holidays and 2 the tax benefit related to german tax reform of 39 million recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 these benefits are partially offset by the accounting treatment of recent tax law changes in mexico see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

earnings from discontinued operations primarily relate to acetyl intermediates’ sale of its oxo products and derivatives businesses in february 2007 the shut down of its edmonton alberta canada methanol operations during the second quarter of 2007 and its pentaerythritol “pe” operations which were discontinued during the third quarter of 2006 as a result revenues and expenses related to these businesses and operations are reflected as a component of discontinued operations

gur ® and lcp pom pps lfrt pbt and pet are used in a broad range of products including automotive components electronics appliances and industrial applications gur ® is used in battery separators conveyor belts filtration equipment coatings and medical devices primary end markets for lcp are electrical and electronics 

 

net sales increased 3 during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of implemented pricing increases combined with favorable foreign currency impacts increases in net sales were partially offset by lower volumes due to significant weakness in the us and european automotive and housing industries extended plant shutdowns enacted by major car manufacturers during the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed significantly to the volume decline 

 

operating profit declined 101 million primarily due to higher raw material freight and energy costs raw material costs increased on higher prices while freight costs increased as a result of increased freight rates and larger shipments to asia raw material costs declined late in 2008 and we expect to realize a benefit from the lower prices early in 2009 as our highercost inventory levels diminish higher depreciation and amortization expense and increased other charges also contributed to lower operating profit depreciation and amortization expense are higher in 2008 due to the startup of the gur ® and lfrt units in asia other charges consist primarily of a 16 million longlived asset impairment loss related to the potential closure of certain advanced engineered materials’ facilities and 12 million related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach see “ticona kelsterbach plant relocation” below 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased due to decreased operating profit and decreased equity in net earnings of affiliates equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased 18 million during 2008 primarily due to reduced earnings from our advanced engineered materials’ affiliates resulting from higher raw material and energy costs and decreased demand 

 

ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

 

in 2007 we finalized a settlement agreement with the frankfurt germany airport “fraport” to relocate our kelsterbach germany business resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned frankfurt airport expansion as a result of the settlement we will transition ticona’s operations from kelsterbach to the hoechst industrial park in the rhine main area by mid2011 over a fiveyear period fraport will pay ticona a total of €670 million to offset the costs associated with the transition of the business from its current location and the closure of the kelsterbach plant in june 2008 we received €200 million 311 million from fraport under this agreement amounts received from fraport are accounted for as deferred proceeds and are included in noncurrent other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

 

in february 2009 we announced the fraport supervisory board approved the acceleration of the 2009 and 2010 payments of €200 million and €140 million respectively required by the settlement agreement signed in june 2007 on february 5 2009 we received a discounted amount of approximately €322 million excluding valueadded tax of €59 million

consumer specialties 

 

 

 

our consumer specialties segment consists of our acetate products and nutrinova businesses our acetate products business primarily produces and supplies acetate tow which is used in the production of filter products we also produce acetate flake which is processed into acetate fiber in the form of a tow band our nutrinova business produces and sells sunett ®  a high intensity sweetener and food protection ingredients such as sorbates for the food beverage and pharmaceuticals industries 

 

net sales increased 4 to 1155 million during the year ended december 31 2008 driven primarily by pricing actions in our acetate products business and an additional month of sales from our acetate products limited “apl” acquisition which was acquired on january 31 2007 offset by lower volumes lower volumes are a direct result of our strategic decision to shift acetate flake production to our china ventures which are accounted for as cost method investments the full impact of this shift has been realized during 2008 and thus the resulting trend of diminishing volumes is not expected to continue lower flake volumes were partially offset by a 5 increase in tow volumes as we were able to capture a portion of the growth in global tow demand 

 

the increase in net sales due to higher sales prices during 2008 was offset most significantly by higher energy costs and to a lesser extent higher raw material and freight costs operating profit as compared to 2007 declined primarily due to the absence of a 22 million gain on the sale of our edmonton alberta canada facility in 2007 other charges during 2007 includes 3 million of deferred compensation plan expenses and 5 million of other restructuring charges offset by insurance recoveries of 5 million for partial satisfaction of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests of 237 million increased from 2007 as increased dividends from our china ventures more than offset the decline in operating profit increased dividends are the result of increased volumes and higher prices as well as efficiency improvements 

industrial specialties

net sales increased by 4 during 2008 as increased prices and favorable foreign currency impacts more than offset volume reductions pricing actions implemented by all business lines late in 2007 and during 2008 contributed to the increase in net sales volumes declined primarily on decreased demand across all regions due to the global economic downturn combined with the temporary shutdown of our at plastics plant late in 2008 the overall volume decline was partially offset by increased emulsions volumes at our nanjing china facility which began operating late in 2008 

 

increased net sales were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs during 2008 the 19 million increase in operating profit was primarily due to lower other charges and the absence of the 7 million loss on the divestiture of our at plastics’ films business in 2007 during 2007 we initiated a plan to simplify and optimize our emulsions and pvoh businesses to focus on technology and innovation other charges during 2008 includes a charge of 3 million for employee termination benefits and accelerated depreciation related to this plan other charges during 2007 includes a charge of 14 million for employee termination benefits 3 million for an impairment of longlived assets and 5 million of accelerated depreciation expense for our shuttered united kingdom plant related to this plan other charges in 2007 also include 6 million of goodwill impairment and receipt of 7 million in insurance recoveries in partial satisfaction of the business interruption losses resulting from the temporary unplanned outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility

net sales increased by 7 during 2008 primarily due to increased prices and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by lower volumes our formulabased pricing arrangements benefited from higher ethylene and methanol costs during the first nine months of 2008 market tightness in the americas and favorable foreign currency impacts in europe also contributed to the increase in net sales reduced volumes offset the increase in net sales as the slowdown of the global economy caused customers to slow production and diminish current inventory levels particularly in asia during the fourth quarter we expect the impact of our customers’ destocking initiatives to continue to a lesser extent during 2009 ethylene and methanol prices decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 on slowed global demand 

 

operating profit declined 307 million primarily as a result of higher ethylene methanol and energy prices increased other charges increased depreciation and amortization and the absence of a 12 million gain on the sale of our edmonton facility in 2007 other charges increased during 2008 partially due to 76 million of longlived asset impairment losses recognized in 2008 related to the potential closure of our acetic acid and vam production facility in pardies france our vam production unit in cangrejera mexico which we subsequently decided to shut down effective at the end of february 2009 and certain other facilities other charges in 2008 also includes 23 million of longlived asset impairment and 13 million of severance and retention charges related to the shutdown of our pampa texas facility also contributing to the increase was the absence of a onetime payment of 31 million received in 2007 in resolution of commercial disputes with a vendor and a 25 million decrease in insurance recoveries received in partial satisfaction of the losses resulting from the temporary outage of the acetic acid unit at our clear lake texas facility increased depreciation and amortization expense during 2008 is the result of accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of our pampa texas facility and a full year of depreciation for our acetic acid plant in nanjing china which started up in mid2007 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interest differs from operating profit primarily as a result of dividend income from our cost investment national methanol co “ibn sina” increased dividend income of 41 million during 2008 had a positive impact on earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interest ibn sina increased their dividends as a result of higher earnings from expanding margins for methanol and methyl tertiarybutyl ether 

other activities 

 

other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including finance and administrative activities and our captive insurance companies 

 

net sales remained flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 we do not expect thirdparty revenues from our captive insurance companies to increase significantly in the near future 

 

the operating loss for other activities improved 90 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due to lower other charges partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses other charges decreased principally due to the release of reserves related to the sorbates antitrust actions settlement of 8 million and the absence of 59 million of deferred compensation plan costs which were incurred during 2007 selling general and administrative expenses increased due to additional spending on business optimization and finance improvement initiatives during 2008 

 

the loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased 346 million during 2008 the significant decrease was primarily due to the absence of 256 million of refinancing costs incurred in 2007 and the decrease in the operating loss discussed above

net cash from investing activities decreased from a cash inflow of 143 million in 2007 to a cash outflow of 201 million in 2008 net cash from investing activities decreased primarily due to cash spent in settlement of our cross currency swaps of 93 million see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements and the absence of proceeds from the sale of our oxo products and derivatives businesses during 2007 these amounts were offset by net cash received on the sale of marketable securities 111 million and the excess of cash received from fraport over amounts spent in connection with the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation 

 

net cash from investing activities improved to a cash inflow of 143 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of 268 million in 2006 the increase in cash inflow was primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our oxo products and derivatives businesses partially offset by the cash outflow for the apl acquisition additionally our cash outflow for capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2007 was 44 million higher compared to the same period in 2006 during the year ended december 31 2006 we increased restricted cash by 42 million related to the anticipated payment to minority shareholders for their remaining celanese gmbh formerly celanese ag shares during the year ended december 31 2007 as a result of the completion of the squeezeout see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and the payment to minority shareholders for their remaining celanese gmbh shares restricted cash decreased 46 million 

 

our cash outflow for capital expenditures were 274 million 288 million and 244 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach capital expenditures were primarily related to major replacements of equipment capacity expansions major investments to reduce future operating costs and environmental health and safety initiatives capital expenditures in 2008 2007 and 2006 included costs for the expansion of our nanjing china site into an integrated chemical complex cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 175 million in 2009 excluding amounts related to the relocation of our ticona plant in kelsterbach 

 

on february 5 2009 we received approximately €322 million of cash from fraport in connection with the ticona kelsterbach plant relocation excluding valueadded tax of €59 million we anticipate related cash outflows for capital expenditures in 2009 will range from 350 to 370 million 

 

net cash used in financing activities 

 

net cash from financing activities increased to a cash outflow of 499 million in 2008 compared to a cash outflow of 714 million during 2007 the increase primarily relates to the absence of cash outflows attributable to the debt refinancing in 2007 also contributing to the increase cash spent to repurchase shares was 25 million less during 2008 than during 2007 decreased cash received for stock option exercises of 51 million partially offset the increase 

 

net cash from financing activities decreased to a cash outflow of 714 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of 108 million in the same period in 2006 the decrease primarily relates to the repurchase of shares of our series a common stock and the debt refinancing as discussed in note 17 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements respectively this decrease was partially offset by 69 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options primarily as a result of the debt refinancing we incurred a net cash outflow of 119 million related to repayments of our debt and 240 million for various refinancing expenses during the year ended december 31 2007 furthermore we paid a total of 403 million to repurchase shares of our series a common stock during the year ended december 31 2007 

 

in addition exchange rate effects on cash and cash equivalents decreased to an unfavorable currency effect of 35 million in 2008 compared to a favorable impact of 39 million in 2007 and a favorable impact of 26 million in 2006 

debt and other obligations 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had total debt of 3533 million and cash and cash equivalents of 676 million resulting in net debt of 2857 million a 126 million increase over december 31 2007 decreased cash of 149 million and noncash increases in debt of 102 million primarily resulting from new capital lease obligations were partially offset by net cash paydowns on debt of 98 million and favorable foreign currency impacts of 27 million 

 

senior credit facilities 

 

our senior credit agreement consists of 2280 million of us dollardenominated and €400 million of eurodenominated term loans due 2014 a 650 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a 228 million creditlinked revolving facility terminating in 2014 as of december 31 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility accordingly 650 million remained available for borrowing as of december 31 2008 there were 91 million of letters of credit issued under the creditlinked revolving facility and 137 million remained available for borrowing our senior credit agreement requires us to maintain a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio not greater than 390 to 100 if there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility the first lien senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization subject to adjustments identified in the credit agreement see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our senior credit facilities 

 

commitments relating to share capital 

 

our board of directors adopted a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of our series a common stock at an annual rate of 016 per share unless our board of directors in its sole discretion determines otherwise for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we paid 24 million 25 million and 26 million respectively in cash dividends on our series a common stock on january 5 2009 we declared a 6 million cash dividend which was paid on february 1 2009 

 

holders of our perpetual preferred stock are entitled to receive when as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available quarterly cash dividends at the rate of 425 per annum or 0265625 per share of liquidation preference dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial issuance the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into approximately 126 shares of our series a common stock subject to adjustments per 2500 liquidation preference of the preferred stock for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we paid 10 million annually of cash dividends on our preferred stock on january 5 2009 we declared a 3 million cash dividend on our convertible perpetual preferred stock which was paid on february 1 2009 

 

based upon the number of outstanding shares as of december 31 2008 the cash dividends to be paid in 2009 are expected to result in annual dividend payments similar to that paid in 2008

purchases of treasury stock 

 

in february 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 400 million of our series a common stock this authorization was increased to 500 million in october 2008 the authorization gives management discretion in determining the conditions under which shares may be repurchased this repurchase program does not have an expiration date during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 9763200 shares of our series a common stock at an average purchase price of 3868 per share for a total of approximately 378 million in connection with this authorization 

 

these purchases reduced the number of shares outstanding and the repurchased shares may be used by us for compensation programs utilizing our stock and other corporate purposes we account for treasury stock using the cost method and include treasury stock as a component of shareholders’ equity 

 

plumbing actions 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business as of december 31 2008 and 2007 there were reserves of 64 million and 65 million respectively related to plumbing action litigation although it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters we believe based on the advice of legal counsel that adequate provisions have been made and that the 

ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have not entered into any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

market risks 

 

please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” under item 7a of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

 

we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 

recoverability of longlived assets 

 

we assess the recoverability of longlived assets excluding goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived asset may not be recoverable examples of a change in events or circumstances include but are not limited to a decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a history of cash flow losses related to the use of the longlived asset or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used to assess the recoverability of longlived assets excluding goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the carrying amount of the longlived asset or group of longlived assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the longlived asset or group of longlived assets if such longlived assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the longlived assets exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets 

 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is measured using a discounted cash flow model we periodically engage a thirdparty valuation consultant to assist us with this process 

 

the development of future net undiscounted cash flow projections and the discounted cash flow projections require management projections related to sales and profitability trends other future results of operations and discount rates these projections which require significant judgment are consistent with projections we use to manage our operations internally to the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections impairment losses may occur in future periods 

 

income taxes 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized such evaluations require significant management 

judgments valuation allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us the united kingdom and canada 

 

we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence the actual outcome of the future tax consequence could differ from our estimate due to changes in future circumstances and may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

benefit obligations 

 

we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the employee retirement income security act based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 

 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2008 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan which represents approximately 83 and 78 of our pension plan assets and liabilities respectively on average the actual return on these plan assets over the longterm 15 to 20 years has exceeded 90 

 

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 5 million in 2008 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2008 we increased the discount rate to 650 from 630 as of december 31 2007 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in our discount rate will decrease our annual pension expenses by an estimated 1 million and increase our benefit obligations by approximately 144 million for our us pension plan in addition the same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than 1 million and 8 million respectively for our us postretirement medical plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the nonus pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by approximately 1 million and less than 1 million respectively and will increase our benefit obligations by approximately 30 million and 2 million respectively 

 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the apbo as of december 31 2008 and the 2008 postretirement benefit cost to change by approximately 3 million and 3 million respectively see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

accounting for commitments and contingencies 

 

we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience with respect to environmental liabilities it is our policy to accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 5 contingencies and commitments and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risks 

 

our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities “sfas no 133” amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 148 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate obligation these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

 

in march 2007 in anticipation of the april 2007 debt refinancing we entered into various us dollar and euro interest rate swap agreements which became effective on april 2 2007 with notional amounts of 16 billion and €150 million respectively the notional amount of the 16 billion us dollar interest rate swaps decreased by 400 million effective january 2 2008 and decreased by another 200 million effective january 2 2009 to offset the declines we entered into us dollar interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of 400 million which became effective on january 2 2008 and an additional us dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of 200 million which will become effective april 2 2009 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had 23 billion €454 million and cny 15 billion of variable rate debt of which 16 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves 674 million €304 million and cny 15 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 13 million 

 

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted transactions forward contracts are not designated as hedges under sfas no 133 

 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net foreign exchange exposure related to short long foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding by currency all of the contracts included in the table below will have approximately offsetting effects from actual underlying payables receivables intercompany loans or other assets or liabilities subject to foreign exchange remeasurement 

 

 

 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

 

to protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation we entered into cross currency swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004 the cross currency swaps and the eurodenominated portion of the senior term loan were designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation we dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the debt refinancing in april 2007 and redesignated the cross currency swaps and new senior euro term loan in july 2007 as a result we recorded 26 million of marktomarket losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior euro term loan during this period 

 

under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements we paid approximately €13 million in interest and received approximately 16 million in interest on june 15 and december 15 of each year the fair value of the net obligation under the cross currency swaps was included in current other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2007 upon maturity of the cross currency swap arrangements in june 2008 we owed €276 million 426 million and were owed 333 million in settlement of the obligation we paid 93 million net of interest of 3 million in june 2008 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we dedesignated €385 million of the €400 million eurodenominated portion of the term loan previously designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation prior to this dedesignation we had been using external derivative contracts to offset foreign currency exposures on 

intercompany loans the foreign currency exposure resulting from dedesignation of €385 million of the hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation is expected to offset the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and reducing our exposure to external counterparties the remaining €15 million eurodenominated portion of the term loan continues to be designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation 

 

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

commodity risk management 

 

we have exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement of certain raw materials we manage its exposure primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements and derivative instruments we regularly assess our practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity requirements forward and utilization of other raw material hedging instruments in addition to forward purchase contracts in accordance with changes in market conditions forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity for qualifying contracts we have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception of sfas no 133 as amended as it was probable at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that they would not settle net and would result in physical delivery as such realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract 

 

in addition we occasionally enter into financial derivatives to hedge a component of a raw material or energy source typically these types of transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting these instruments are marked to market at each reporting period and gains losses are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations we recognized no gain or loss from these types of contracts during the year ended december 31 2008 and less than 1 million during each of the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively as of december 31 2008 we did not have any open financial derivative contracts for commodities

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the company internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected 

 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 kpmg llp has audited this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting their report is included below

the board of directors and shareholders 

celanese corporation 

 

we have audited celanese corporation and subsidiaries’ the “company” internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion celanese corporation and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of celanese corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2008 and our report dated february 12 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase a variety of raw materials from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our 

  individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and acetaldehyde although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier there cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year 

 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change our production facilities rely largely on coal fuel oil natural gas and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by our subsidiary which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure through the use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging entering into longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements as of december 31 2007 we did not have any open commodity financial derivative contracts see notes 3 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

we also currently purchase and lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the manufacture of chemical products with growing demand for these precious metals most notably in the automotive industry the cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased caused by a shortage in supply for precious metals the leases are distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product and are divided into several contracts although we seek to offset increases in raw material prices with corresponding increases in the prices of our products we may not be able to do so and there may be periods when such product price increases lag behind raw material cost increases 

 

research and development 

 

all of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness our businesses are innovationoriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications we consider the amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be adequate to drive our growth programs

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired we protect our trademarks vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate 

 

in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor our competitors and vigorously challenge patent and trademark infringement for example acetyl intermediates maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent infringement matters in europe asia and the united states we are currently pursuing a number of matters relating to the infringement of our acetic acid patents some of our earlier acetic acid patents expired in 2007 other patent applications covering acetic acid are presently pending 

 

neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent trademark copyright or trade secret

environmental and other regulation 

 

matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in item 1a risk factors item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 17 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 8400 employees worldwide from continuing operations compared to 8900 as of december 31 2006 this represents a decrease of approximately 6 the decrease primarily relates to acquisitions and divestitures during 2007 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the following table sets forth the approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

many of our employees are unionized particularly in germany canada mexico brazil belgium and france however in the united states less than one quarter of our employees are unionized moreover in germany and france wages and general working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements within the limits established by these agreements our various subsidiaries negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations such as workers’ councils representing the employees collective bargaining agreements between the german chemical employers associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have a term of one year while in the united states a three year term for collective bargaining agreements is typical we offer comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory 

 

backlog 

 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

  available information — securities and exchange commission “sec” filings and corporate governance materials 

 

we make available free of charge through our internet website wwwcelanesecom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with or furnishing it to the sec the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers including celanese corporation that electronically file with the sec at httpwwwsecgov 

 

we also make available free of charge through our internet website our corporate governance guidelines of our board of directors and the charters of each of the committees of the board such materials are also available in print upon the written request of any shareholder to celanese corporation 1601 west lbj freeway dallas texas 752346034 attention investor relations 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are a company with operations around the world and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations 

 

we operate in the global market and have customers in many countries we have major facilities primarily located in north america europe and asia and hold interests in ventures that operate in germany china japan south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

 

conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states german or european union governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

 

in particular we have invested significant resources in china and other asian countries we anticipate that this region will experience significant growth in the coming years however if this region’s growth is slower than we anticipate we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and our financial results may be adversely impacted 

 

the industries of many of our customers particularly the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in economic conditions a downturn in one or more of these industries may result in a reduction in our operating margins or in operating losses 

 

some of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

  we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene butane methanol and propylene from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the acetyl intermediates segment principally formaldehyde acetic acid and vam we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our segments we also purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the consumer specialties segment the price of many of these items is dependent on the available supply of such item and may increase significantly as a result of production disruptions or strikes for example the unplanned shutdown of our clear lake texas facility together with other tight supply conditions caused a shortage of acetic acid and increased the price for such product during 2007 in addition prices of natural gas and oil increased dramatically in 2007 and 2006 for reasons outside of our control 

 

we own or lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the production of these chemicals with growing demand for these precious metals most notably in the automotive industry the cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased caused by a shortage in supply 

 

we are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene propylene wood pulp electricity coal and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 

  

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs or if such commodities were unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

 

our operating results especially in our consumer specialties and advanced engineered materials segments depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these include obligations related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between cag and hoechst also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates — environmental liabilities” and notes 17 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

  our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” and the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 “rcra” we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate them we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present consequently compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities which could cause our business and operating results to be less favorable than expected 

 

we are also involved in several claims lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters an adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

 

changes in environmental health and safety regulatory requirements could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

 

new or revised governmental regulations relating to health safety and the environment may also affect demand for our products 

 

pursuant to the european union regulation on risk assessment of existing chemicals the european chemicals bureau of the european commission has been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals the chemicals being evaluated include vam which we produce these risk assessments entail a multistage process to determine the risk posed by manufacturing and handling the product in the case of vam we expect the finalized evaluation by mid 2008 we and other vam producers are participating in this evaluation process with detailed scientific analyses we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any final ruling 

 

in a separate process in september 2007 the euworking group on classification and labelling of dangerous substances under directive 67548eec agreed that vam should be classified in the eu as showing limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect category 3 carcinogen this classification and related labelling requirement should apply only to finished products that contain more than 10000 parts per million of free monomer 

 

several studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer or iarc reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans iarc also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde although it also characterized evidence for such an association as strong the results of iarc’s review will be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde we are participating together with other producers and users in the evaluations of these findings we cannot predict the final effect of iarc’s reclassification 

 

the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” a chemicals policy became effective in the european union on june 1 2007 reach established a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured in or imported to the european union additional testing documentation and risk assessments of various chemicals will occur across the chemical industry some chemical products may have to be taken off the market as a result of reach we are likely to incur additional costs to test document and register products used andor manufactured by us in addition potential litigation arising from reach may adversely affect our operations and financial results by imposing other additional costs on us andor restricting our ability to import or export certain chemical products 

 

other pending initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s 

  chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the european environment and health strategy “scale” 

 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

 

production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands 

 

a disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance if one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs which could cause them to seek other suppliers for example during 2007 production was disrupted for an extended period of time at our clear lake texas facility that produces primarily acetic acid and vam the disruption was caused by an unplanned outage of our acetic acid unit because of this disruption the volumes of our acetyl intermediates segment were lower than we had expected for 2007 as we were unable to fully offset the lost production similar outages could occur in the future from unexpected disruptions at any of our other manufacturing facilities of key products such outages could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future reporting periods 

 

we may experience unexpected difficulties in the relocation of our ticona operations from kelsterbach to the rhine main area which may increase our costs delay the transition or disrupt our ability to supply our customers 

 

we have agreed with fraport to relocate our kelsterbach germany business resolving several years of legal disputes related to the planned frankfurt airport expansion as a result of the settlement we will transition ticona’s operations from kelsterbach to another location in germany by mid2011 in july 2007 we announced that we would relocate the kelsterbach germany business to the hoechst industrial park in the rhine main area over a fiveyear period fraport will pay ticona a total of €670 million to offset the costs associated with the transition of the business from its current location and the closure of the kelsterbach plant while the settlement and related payment amount are meant to be costneutral and represent the actual amount we will require to select a site build new production facilities demolish old production facilities and transition business activities according to schedule and without any disruptions to customer supply we may encounter unexpected costs or other difficulties during the relocation process that bring the total costs of the relocation to an amount greater than the compensation provided 

  by fraport the relocation of these facilities represents a major logistical undertaking and we may have underestimated the amount that will be required to carry out every aspect of the relocation we may lose the services of valuable experienced employees during the transition if they decide not to work at the new location the construction of the new facilities may not be complete on time or may face cost overruns if our costs relating to the relocation exceed the amount of payments from fraport or if the relocation causes other unexpected difficulties our expenses may increase or supplies to our customers may be disrupted 

 

if supply to our customers is disrupted for an extended period this could negatively impact the reputation of this business and result in the loss of customers such effects could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods 

 

recent federal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could if passed into law require us to relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

regulations have recently been issued by the department of homeland security “dhs” aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to these regulations these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack we have registered certain of our sites with dhs in accordance with these regulations however dhs has not yet completed its risk assessment for our sites and until that is done we cannot state with certainty the costs associated with any security plans that dhs may require these regulations may be revised further and additional legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic it is possible that such future legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to us we cannot predict the final form of currently pending legislation or other related legislation that may be passed and can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a future reporting period 

 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

 

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar at a constant level of business our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary’s functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness 

  we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

 

the cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties during those periods of time our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years in recent years an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented to minimize the influence of liability volatility due to interest rate movements similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years if the value of our pension fund’s portfolio declines or does not perform as expected or if our experience with the fund leads us to change our assumptions regarding the fund we may be required to contribute additional capital to the fund 

 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce if we are not successful in protecting our trademark or patent rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 

provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws as well as any shareholders’ rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

 

provisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class 

  elected for a three year term or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock 

 

risks related to the acquisition of cag 

 

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement “domination agreement” may be increased which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

several minority shareholders of cag have initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination agreement on march 14 2005 the frankfurt district court dismissed on grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award proceedings in january 2006 the frankfurt higher district court ruled that the appeals were admissible and the proceedings will therefore continue on december 12 2006 the frankfurt district court appointed an expert to help determine the value of cag as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment could be increased by the court and the purchaser would be required to make such payments within two months after the publication of the court’s ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to us and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see notes 2 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the purchaser may be required to compensate cag for annual losses which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

under the domination agreement the purchaser is required among other things to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred determined in accordance with german accounting requirements by cag at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred this obligation to compensate cag for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the domination agreement if cag incurs losses during any period of the operative term of the domination agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of cag at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to cag to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of cag during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to cag by offsetting against such loss compensation claims by cag any valuable counterclaims against cag that the purchaser may have if the purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to cag to cover an annual loss we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of cag the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we and two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with respect to the purchaser’s obligation under the domination agreement and intercompany indebtedness to cag which may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

our subsidiaries celanese international holdings luxembourg sà rl “cih” formerly celanese caylux holdings luxembourg sca and celanese us have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing so that the purchaser is at all times in a position to completely meet its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement in addition celanese has guaranteed i that the purchaser will meet its obligation under the domination agreement to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred by cag during the term of the domination agreement and ii the repayment of all existing intercompany indebtedness of celanese’s subsidiaries to cag further under the terms of celanese’s guarantee in certain limited circumstances cag may be entitled to require the immediate repayment of some or all of the intercompany indebtedness owed by celanese’s subsidiaries to cag if cih andor celanese us are obligated to make payments under their obligations to the purchaser or cag as the case may be or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to cag is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due 

  risks related to our indebtedness 

 

our level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

 

our total indebtedness is approximately 36 billion as of december 31 2007 

 

our debt could have important consequences including 

 

  

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results 

 

certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same on april 2 2007 we through certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement the new senior credit agreement consists of 2280 million of us dollar denominated and €400 million of euro denominated term loans due 2014 a 650 million revolving credit facility terminating in 2013 and a 228 million creditlinked revolving facility terminating in 2014 borrowings under the new senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on libor for us dollars or euribor for euros as applicable or for us dollar denominated loans under certain circumstances a base rate in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for the term loans and any loans under the creditlinked revolving facility is 175 subject to potential reductions as defined in the new senior credit agreement the term loans under the new senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1 of the initial principal amount per annum payable quarterly commencing in july 2007 the remaining principal amount of the term loans will be due on april 2 2014 

 

if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 23 billion €525 million and cny12 billion of variable rate debt of which 16 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves us approximately 692 million €375 million and cny12 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 14 million there can be no assurance that interest rates will not rise significantly in the future such an increase could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and cash flows 

 

despite our current debt levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt 

 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so if new debt including amounts available under our senior credit agreement is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — liquidity — contractual obligations” 

  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

 

our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand receipt of additional capital including possible additional borrowings and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of distributions advances or cash payments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — liquidity — contractual obligations” 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

the senior credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement limit our ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments make investments and sell certain assets 

 

in addition the senior credit agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain a specified financial ratio if there is outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet those tests at all a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit agreement upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit agreement the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior credit agreement if the lenders under the senior credit agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the senior credit agreement as well as their other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock 

 

the terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us 

 

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries however the terms of our senior credit agreement limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us accordingly our ability to pay dividends on our stock is similarly limited

gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat for the year ended december 31 2007 224 compared to the same period in 2006 227 the slight decrease was primarily due to lower overall volumes and higher energy and raw material costs more than offsetting the higher overall prices and favorable currency impacts particularly related to the euro 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 20 million to 516 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the absence of executive severance and legal costs associated with the squeezeout of 23 million and longterm incentive plan expenses of 20 million both recorded in 2006 selling general and administrative expenses also decreased 5 million due to lower stock based compensation expenses during the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 the decreases were partially offset by 15 million of additional expenses related to finance improvement initiatives and 6 million related to the revised deferred compensation plan expenses

  conjunction with the debt refinancing see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to additional china financing activities in 2007

advanced engineered materials 

 

 

 

advanced engineered materials’ net sales increased 3 to 915 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 the increase for the year was primarily driven by 6 higher volumes volumes increased in all product lines due to increased market penetration and a stronger business environment in 

  europe improved volumes during 2006 were partially offset by the absence of net sales from the coc business which was divested in december 2005 during the year ended december 31 2005 coc recorded approximately 19 million in net sales 

 

operating profit increased to 145 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 60 million for the same period in 2005 as improved net sales more than offset higher raw material and energy costs also contributing to the increases are positive effects from the exit of the coc business including a reduction in other charges gains net due to the 2005 asset impairment charge of 25 million productivity improvements and lower spending due to an organizational redesign during the year ended december 31 2005 coc recorded an operating loss of 69 million including asset impairments mentioned above

consumer specialties’ net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 4 to 876 million compared to the same period in 2005 primarily driven by a 3 increase in pricing as higher overall pricing in the acetate products business more than offset the lower pricing for sunett ® sweetener products sunett ® sweetener pricing declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to nutrinova’s major customers overall volumes for consumer specialties increased slightly driven by higher sunett ® volumes due to strong demand from nutrinova’s customers associated with new product launches as well as the impact from the warmer than normal temperatures in europe and north america in 2006 the increase in volumes was partially offset by lower acetate tow volumes in the acetate products business which were a result of shutting down our canadian tow plant and lower sales to china which was due to the expansion of our china tow ventures 

 

operating profit increased to 165 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 128 million in the same period in 2005 higher overall pricing in the acetate products business volume growth for sunett ® sweetener products and lower other charges gains net more than offset higher raw material costs lower acetate tow volumes and lower sunett ® pricing the lower other charges gains net was due primarily to the absence of 7 million of environmental related plant closure costs recorded in 2005 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased 46 to 185 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 the increase is primarily due to higher operating profits as well as an increase of 19 million in dividends from our china ventures received in 2006 

  industrial specialties

acetyl intermediates’ net sales increased 15 to 3351 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 pricing increased for most products driven primarily by the acetyl business lines higher pricing was a result of continued strong demand for the majority of our products and higher raw material costs overall volumes increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to increased demand in asia net sales also increased due to 307 million of net sales from acetex excluding at plastics which was acquired in july 2005 an increase of 172 million compared to the same period in 2005 

 

operating profit decreased 6 to 456 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 as higher raw material costs and natural gas prices more than offset strong demands for our acetyl products and lower other charges gains net the lower other charges gains net was due to the absence of 6 million of severance costs associated with the closure of the edmonton methanol plant and 5 million of environmental related plant closure costs both recorded in 2005 

 

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased 6 to 519 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to lower operating profits and lower dividend income from our cost investments 

 

other activities 

 

net sales for other activities decreased to 22 million from 32 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the absence of 8 million of net sales resulting from the sale of pbi and vectran product lines during the second quarter of 2005 

 

operating loss increased to 190 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to a loss of 184 million in the same period in 2005 the operating loss increased during the year due to executive severance and legal costs of 23 million associated with the squeezeout of cag shareholders stockbased compensation expense of 20 million resulting from our adoption of sfas no 123r and 14 million related to our longterm incentive plan the increase was partially offset by the absence of 45 million of other charges gains net related to the 2005 advisor monitoring fee and the termination of advisor monitoring services agreement during the first quarter of 2005

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to a cash inflow of 566 million in 2007 compared to a cash inflow of 751 million for the same period in 2006 the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to adjustments to cash for discontinued operations and an increase in working capital partially offset by an increase in earnings from continuing operations adjustments to cash for discontinued operations of 84 million relates primarily to working capital changes of the oxo products and derivatives businesses and the shut down of our edmonton canada methanol facility during 2007 earnings from continuing operations increased to 336 million during the year ended december 31 2007 compared with 319 million for the same period in 2006 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 751 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 701 million for the same period in 2005 the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to an increase in earnings from continuing operations partially offset by an increase in cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities earnings from continuing operations increased to 319 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 214 million for the same period in 2005 the changes in operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by higher trade and other receivables offset by higher trade payables the increase in receivables is due to higher net sales the increase in trade payables is due to the timing of payments 

 

net cash provided byused in investing activities 

 

net cash from investing activities improved to a cash inflow of 143 million in 2007 compared to a cash outflow of 268 million in 2006 the increase in cash inflow was primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our oxo products and derivatives businesses partially offset by the cash outflow for the apl acquisition additionally our cash outflow for capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2007 was 44 million higher compared to the same period in 2006 during the year ended december 31 2006 we increased restricted cash by 42 million related to the anticipated payment to minority shareholders for their remaining cag shares during the year ended december 31 2007 as a result of the completion of the squeezeout see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the payment to minority shareholders for their remaining cag shares restricted cash decreased 46 million 

 

net cash from investing activities improved to a cash outflow of 268 million in 2006 compared to a cash outflow of 907 million in 2005 the decrease in cash outflow is primarily due to cash paid of 473 million for the purchase of additional cag shares in 2005 216 million for the purchase of acetex in july 2005 and 198 million 

  for the purchase of vinamul in february 2005 these decreases were offset by the net effect of an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures of 41 million an increase in restricted cash of 42 million a decrease in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities of 42 million proceeds received for the kelsterbach plant relocation of 26 million in 2006 the net effect of a decrease in investing cash used in discontinued operations of 105 million a decrease in fees associated with the 2005 acquisitions of 29 million and a decrease in the proceeds received from the sales of assets of 25 million

pension and other postretirement obligations our contributions for pension and postretirement benefits are expected to be 40 million and 34 million respectively in 2008 

 

other matters 

 

plumbing actions and sorbates litigation 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business for the year ended december 31 2007 there were 23 million of cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation for the year ended december 31 2006 there were 14 million of cash inflows in 

  connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation in february 2005 we settled with an insurance carrier and received cash proceeds of 44 million in march 2005 and in december 2005 we received 30 million in additional settlements as of december 31 2007 and 2006 there were reserves of 235 million and 214 million respectively for these matters in addition we have receivables from insurance companies and hoechst or its legal successors in connection with the plumbing and sorbates matters of 137 million and 141 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

although it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters we believe based on the advice of legal counsel that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have not entered into any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

market risks 

 

please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” under item 7a of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

 

we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 

recoverability of longlived assets 

 

our business is capital intensive and has required and will continue to require significant investments in property plant and equipment as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the carrying amount of property plant and equipment was 2362 million and 2155 million respectively whenever events or circumstances change we assess the recoverability of property plant and equipment to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or the indefinitelived intangible asset may not be fully recoverable as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had 1291 million and 1338 million respectively of goodwill and other intangible assets net 

 

as of december 31 2007 there were no other significant changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that led us to believe goodwill might have been impaired we will continue to evaluate the need for impairment if changes in circumstances or available information indicate that impairment may have occurred we perform the required impairment test at least annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing 

  a prolonged general economic downturn and specifically a continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure create an imbalance of industry supply and demand or otherwise diminish volumes or profits such events combined with changes in interest rates could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our longlived assets consequently it is possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of our longlived assets 

 

other charges gains net 

 

other charges gains net include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a decision to exit nonstrategic businesses these measures are based on formal management decisions establishment of agreements with the employees’ representatives or individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan the related reserves reflect certain estimates including those pertaining to separation costs settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at the end of each reporting period actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

environmental liabilities 

 

we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated depending on the nature of the site we accrue through fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond fifteen years if the event of loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable but is reasonably possible we provide appropriate disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements if the contingency is considered material we estimate environmental liabilities on a casebycase basis using the most current status of available facts existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable see also note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

asset retirement obligations 

 

sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 provides guidelines as to when a company is required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation the liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded the corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life we have identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to certain of our existing operating facilities examples of these types of obligations include demolition decommissioning disposal and restoration activities legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations however operations at these facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time we will continue to assess strategies that may differ from past business decisions regarding the continuing operation of existing facilities asset retirement obligations will be recorded if these strategies are changed and probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities if certain operating facilities were to close the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

realization of deferred tax assets 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the 

  reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized such evaluations require significant management judgments valuation allowances have been established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us and canada see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

tax contingencies 

 

we record accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities prior to 2007 we accrued for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated 

 

on january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax benefit is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition 

 

under fin 48 tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than 50 based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

benefit obligations 

 

we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the employee retirement income security act contributions to the various pension and other postretirement benefit plans are further discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financials statements benefits are generally based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate rates of increase in compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 

 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan which represents greater than 83 and 75 of pension plan assets and liabilities respectively on average the actual return on plan assets over the longterm 15 to 20 years has exceeded 90 for the year ended december 31 2007 the us qualified defined benefit pension plan assets actual return was 100 basis points more than the expected longterm rate of return of plan assets for the year ended december 31 2006 the actual return was 630 basis points more than the expected longterm rate of return of plan assets based on our investment strategy we believe that 85 is a reasonable longterm rate of return 

 

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 6 million in 2007 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the 

  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities as of december 31 2007 we increased the discount rate to 630 from 588 as of december 31 2006 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in our discount rate will decrease our annual pension expenses by an estimated 1 million and increase our benefit obligations by approximately 150 million for our us pension plan in addition the same basis point decline in our discount rate will also increase our annual expenses and benefit obligations by less than 1 million and 9 million respectively for our us postretirement medical plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the nonus pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated 1 million and less than 1 million respectively and will increase our benefit obligations by approximately 36 million and 2 million respectively 

 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the postretirement benefit cost for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 includes 18 million 21 million and 25 million respectively the accrued postretirement liability was 306 million and 343 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and is included in longterm other liabilities the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the apbo as of december 31 2007 and the 2007 postretirement benefit cost to change by approximately 4 million and 1 million respectively see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

accounting for commitments and contingencies 

 

we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with sfas no 5 contingencies and commitments and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the outstanding commitments and contingencies and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

business combinations 

 

upon closing an acquisition we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as soon as practicable given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company’s balance sheet frequently with implications for the purchase price of the acquisition then to adjust the acquired company’s accounting policies procedures books and records to our standards it is often several quarters before we are able to finalize those initial fair value estimates accordingly it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised within twelve months of an acquisition the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

captive insurance companies 

 

we have two wholly owned insurance companies the “captives” that are used as a form of self insurance for property liability and workers compensation risks one of the captives also insures certain thirdparty risks the liabilities recorded by the captives relate to the estimated risk of loss which is based on our estimates and actuarial 

  valuations and unearned premiums which represent the portion of the thirdparty premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies inforce liabilities are recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and we can reasonably estimate its liability in addition liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure on both known and unasserted claims estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities premiums written are recognized as revenue based on the terms of the policies capitalization of the captives is determined by regulatory guidelines 

 

the captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the captives from its obligation to policyholders failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the captives the captives evaluate the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed noncollectible

market risks 

 

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including use of derivatives we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are primarily accounted for under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities “sfas no 133” amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 148 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt we utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate obligation these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had an interest rate swap agreement in place with a notional value of 300 million on march 29 2007 in connection with the april 2 2007 debt refinancing we terminated this interest rate swap agreement and recognized a gain of 2 million related to amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net 

 

in march 2007 in anticipation of the april 2 2007 debt refinancing we entered into various us dollar and euro interest rate swap agreements which became effective on april 2 2007 with notional amounts of 16 billion and €150 million respectively these swaps remained outstanding as of december 31 2007 effective january 2 2008 the notional amount of the 16 billion us dollar swap will decrease by 400 million on november 16 2007 we entered into an additional us dollar interest rate swap with a notional amount of 400 million which became effective on january 2 2008 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 23 billion €525 million and cny12 billion of variable rate debt of which 16 billion and €150 million is hedged with interest rate swaps which leaves us approximately 692 million €375 million and cny12 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 14 million 

 

see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  foreign exchange risk management 

 

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes net of related tax effects are minimized it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from time to time we may also hedge our currency exposure related to forecasted earnings forward contracts that are hedging receivables and payables booked in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity are not designated as hedges under sfas no 133 

 

additionally a portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

 

to protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation we entered into cross currency swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004 under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements we pay approximately €13 million in interest and receive approximately 16 million in interest on june 15 and december 15 of each year upon maturity of the cross currency swap agreement in june 2008 we will pay approximately €276 million and receive approximately 333 million these cross currency swaps and our senior euro term loan are designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation we dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the debt refinancing in april 2007 and redesignated the cross currency swaps and new senior euro term loan in july 2007 as a result we recorded approximately 26 million of marktomarket losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior euro term loan during this period 

 

see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

commodity risk management 

 

inherent in our business is exposure to price changes for several commodities we manage our exposure primarily through the use of longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements in addition our policy allows us to enter into forward swap andor option contracts to mitigate shortterm fluctuations in market prices for certain raw materials and energy principally natural gas these contracts are typically settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

during the second half of 2007 we continued to refine our new sap consolidation system for our financial reporting which was implemented during the second quarter of 2007 this implementation has involved various changes to internal processes and control procedures over financial reporting however the basic internal controls over financial reporting have not materially changed at the time of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2007 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the company internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected 

 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2007 kpmg llp has audited this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting their report is included below 

  report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

the board of directors and shareholders celanese corporation

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion celanese corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

certain cost investments where we own greater than a 20 ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of accounting because we cannot exercise significant influence are not involved in the daytoday operations and are unable to obtain timely us gaap financial information from these entities 

 

raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase a variety of raw materials from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and acetaldehyde although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier there cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year 

 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change our production facilities rely largely on coal fuel oil natural gas and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by our subsidiary which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure through the use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging entering into longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements see notes 4 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

we also currently lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the manufacture of chemical products with growing demand for these precious metals most notably in the automotive industry the cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased caused by a shortage in supply for precious metals the leases are distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product and are divided into several contracts although we seek to offset increases in raw material prices with corresponding increases in the prices of our products we may not be able to do so and there may be periods when such product price increases lag behind raw material cost increases 

 

research and development 

 

all of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness our businesses are innovationoriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications we consider the amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be adequate to drive our growth program 

 

intellectual property 

 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding 

patents have expired we protect our trademarks vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate 

 

in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor our competitors and vigorously challenge patent and trademark infringement for example chemical products maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent infringement matters in europe asia and the united states we are currently pursuing a number of matters relating to the infringement of our acetic acid patents some of our earlier acetic acid patents will expire in 2007 other patent applications covering acetic acid are presently pending 

 

neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent trademark copyright or trade secret 

 

environmental and other regulation 

 

matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in item 1a risk factors item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 8900 employees worldwide from continuing operations compared to 9300 as of december 31 2005 this represents a decrease of approximately 4 the following table sets forth the approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

many of our employees are unionized particularly in germany canada mexico brazil belgium and france however in the united states less than one quarter of our employees are unionized moreover in germany and france wages and general working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements within the limits established by these agreements our various subsidiaries negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations such as workers’ councils representing the employees collective bargaining agreements between the german chemical employers associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have a term of one year while in the united states a three year term for collective bargaining agreements is typical we offer comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory 

 

backlog 

 

we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity in general we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

 

available information — securities and exchange commission “sec” filings and corporate governance materials 

 

we make available free of charge through our internet website wwwcelanesecom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with or furnishing it to the sec the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers including celanese corporation that electronically file with the sec at httpwwwsecgov

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are an international company and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations 

 

we operate in the global market and have customers in many countries we have major facilities located in north america europe and asia hold interests in ventures that operate in germany china japan south korea and saudi arabia our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions 

 

conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increasing security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of the united states german or european union governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock 

 

the industries of many of our customers particularly the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in economic conditions a downturn in one or more of these industries may result in a reduction in our operating margins or in operating losses 

 

some of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are 

highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy 

 

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene butane methanol and propylene from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the chemical products segment principally formaldehyde acetic acid and vam we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our segments we also purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the acetate products segment we purchase significant amounts of natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil to supply the energy required in our production processes prices of natural gas oil and other hydrocarbons and energy increased dramatically in 2006 and 2005 

 

we own or lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the production of these chemicals with growing demand for these precious metals most notably in the automotive industry the cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased caused by a shortage in supply 

 

we are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene propylene wood pulp electricity coal and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include 

 

  

if we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs or if such commodities were unavailable it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

 

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position 

 

our operating results especially in our performance products and ticona segments depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized 

 

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 

 

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these include obligations related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between cag and hoechst also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates — environmental liabilities” and notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate them we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present consequently compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities which could cause our business and operating results to be less favorable than expected 

 

we are also involved in several claims lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters an adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period 

 

changes in environmental health and safety regulatory requirements could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

 

new or revised governmental regulations relating to health safety and the environment may also affect demand for our products 

 

pursuant to the european union regulation on risk assessment of existing chemicals the european chemicals bureau of the european commission has been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals some of the chemicals initially being evaluated include vam which we produce these risk assessments entail a multistage process to determine to what extent the european commission should classify the chemical as a carcinogen and if so whether this classification and related labeling requirements should apply only to finished products that contain specified threshold concentrations of a particular chemical in the case of vam we currently do not expect a final ruling until the end of 2007 we and other vam producers are participating in this process with detailed scientific analyses supporting the industry’s position that vam is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling of final products should not be required we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any final ruling 

 

several recent studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer or iarc recently reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans iarc also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde although it also characterized evidence for such an association as strong the results of iarc’s review will be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde we are participating together with other producers and users in the evaluations of these findings we cannot predict the final effect of iarc’s reclassification 

 

other recent initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the new european environment and health strategy commonly known as scale as well as the proposal for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach reach which the european commission proposed in october 2003 will establish a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured in or imported to the european union additional testing documentation and risk assessments will occur for the chemical industry this will affect european producers of chemicals as well as all chemical companies worldwide that export to member states of the european union 

 

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to 

use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results 

 

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and waste these risks include among other things pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances 

 

these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows 

 

recently proposed federal legislation aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could if passed into law require us to relocate certain manufacturing activities and require us to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

legislation is currently pending in congress which is aimed at decreasing the risk and effects of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the united states pursuant to proposed legislation these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain highpriority facilities develop a prevention preparedness and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment in addition companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack pending legislation will likely be revised further and additional legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic it is possible that such future legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than what has recently been proposed and which would be more costly to us we cannot predict the final form of currently pending legislation or other related legislation that may be passed and can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a future reporting period 

 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability 

 

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may decrease our profits in comparison to the profits of our competitors on the same products sold in the same markets and increase the cost of items required in our operations 

 

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar at a constant level of business our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

 

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary’s functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively and volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial 

condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness 

 

we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but we cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective 

 

failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

 

our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years 

 

cag may be required to make payments to hoechst 

 

under its 1999 demerger agreement with hoechst cag agreed to indemnify hoechst for environmental liabilities that hoechst may incur with respect to cag’s german production sites which were transferred from hoechst to cag in connection with the demerger cag also has an obligation to indemnify hoechst against liabilities for environmental damages or contamination arising under certain divestiture agreements entered into by hoechst prior to the demerger as the indemnification obligations depend on the occurrence of unpredictable future events the costs associated with them are not yet determinable and may materially affect operating results 

 

cag’s obligation to indemnify hoechst against liabilities for environmental contamination in connection with the divestiture agreements is subject to the following thresholds 

 

  

cag has made total cumulative payments through december 31 2006 of 44 million for environmental contamination liabilities in connection with the divestiture agreements and may be required to make additional payments in the future as of december 31 2006 we have reserves of approximately 33 million for this contingency and may be required to record additional reserves in the future 

 

also cag has undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify hoechst to the extent that hoechst is required to discharge liabilities including tax liabilities in relation to assets included in the demerger where such liabilities have not been demerged due to transfer or other restrictions cag did not make any payments to hoechst during the year ended december 31 2006 2005 or 2004 in connection with this indemnity 

 

under the demerger agreement cag will also be responsible directly or indirectly for all of hoechst’s obligations to past employees of businesses that were demerged to cag under the demerger agreement hoechst agreed to indemnify cag from liabilities other than liabilities for environmental contamination stemming from the agreements governing the divestiture of hoechst’s polyester businesses which were demerged to cag insofar as such liabilities relate to the european part of that business hoechst has also agreed to bear 80 of the financial 

obligations arising in connection with the government investigation and litigation associated with the sorbates industry for price fixing described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements and cag has agreed to bear the remaining 20 

 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results 

 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 19 billion of variable rate debt of which 03 billion is hedged with an interest rate swap which leaves us approximately 16 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 16 million there can be no assurance that interest rates will not rise significantly in the future such an increase could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and cash flows 

 

the disposition by the original shareholders of at least 90 of their equity interest will satisfy a vesting condition under our deferred compensation plan 

 

in december 2004 we approved among other incentive and retention programs a deferred compensation plan for executive officers and key employees the programs were intended to align management performance with the creation of shareholder value the deferred compensation plan has an aggregate maximum amount payable of 196 million over five years ending in 2009 the initial component of the deferred compensation plan vested in 2004 and was paid in the first quarter of 2005 the remaining aggregate maximum amount payable of 142 million is subject to downward adjustment if the price of our series a common stock falls below the initial public offering price of 16 per share and vests subject to both i continued employment or the achievement of certain performance criteria and 2 the disposition by three of the four original shareholders of at least 90 of their equity interest in the company with at least a 25 cash internal rate of return on their equity interest the original shareholders have an equity interest of approximately 1409 upon the occurrence of a qualifying sale as defined the amount vested and payable under the plan as of december 31 2006 would be approximately 75 million exclusive of 19 million accrued in 2006 and payable in 2007 due to the accelerated vesting of certain plan participants 

 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our profit margins 

 

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce 

 

we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired if we are not successful in protecting our trademark or patent rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

 

provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as any shareholders’ rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt 

 

provisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that our board of directors may adopt these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock 

 

risks related to the acquisition of cag 

 

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement “domination agreement” may be increased which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

several minority shareholders of cag have initiated special award proceedings seeking the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment offered under the domination agreement on march 14 2005 the frankfurt district court dismissed on grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award proceedings in january 2006 the frankfurt higher district court ruled that the appeals were admissible and the proceedings will therefore continue on december 12 2006 the frankfurt district court appointed an expert to help determine the value of cag as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed annual payment could be increased by the court and the purchaser would be required to make such payments within two months after the publication of the court’s ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders including those who have already received the fair cash compensation would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to us and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see notes 2 and 25 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the purchaser may be required to compensate cag for annual losses which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us 

 

under the domination agreement the purchaser is required among other things to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred determined in accordance with german accounting requirements by cag at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred this obligation to compensate cag for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the domination agreement if cag incurs losses during any period of the operative term of the domination agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of cag at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to cag to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves accrued at the level of cag during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to cag by offsetting against such loss compensation claims by cag any valuable counterclaims against cag that the purchaser may have if the purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to cag to cover an annual loss we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of cag the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we and two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with respect to the purchaser’s obligation under the domination agreement and intercompany indebtedness to cag which may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

our subsidiaries celanese caylux and bcp crystal have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing so that the purchaser is at all times in a position to completely meet its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement in addition celanese has guaranteed i that the purchaser will meet its obligation under the domination agreement to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred by cag during the term of the domination agreement and ii the repayment of all existing intercompany indebtedness of celanese’s subsidiaries to cag further under the terms of celanese’s guarantee in certain limited circumstances cag may be entitled to require the immediate repayment of some or all of the intercompany indebtedness owed by celanese’s subsidiaries to cag if celanese celanese caylux andor bcp crystal are obligated to make payments under their obligations to the purchaser or cag as the case may be or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to cag is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due or other expenditures 

 

the price paid by the purchaser for the acquisition of the remaining outstanding cag shares may be challenged in court 

 

the price could increase if the amount of fair cash compensation is successfully challenged in court see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

risks related to our indebtedness 

 

our high level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness 

 

we are highly leveraged our total indebtedness is approximately 35 billion as of december 31 2006 excluding 134 million of future accretion on the senior discount notes 

 

our substantial debt could have important consequences including 

 

  

despite our current high leverage we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks of our high leverage 

 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so if new debt including amounts available under our amended and restated senior credit facilities is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — liquidity — contractual obligations” 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

 

our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand receipt of additional capital including possible additional borrowings and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of distributions advances or cash payments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — liquidity — contractual obligations” 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the amended and restated senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

 

the amended and restated senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions the covenants contained in the indentures limit the ability of crystal llc bcp crystal and their restricted subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase their capital stock or make other restricted payments make investments and sell certain assets 

 

in addition the amended and restated senior credit facilities contain covenants that require celanese holdings to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests celanese holdings’ ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control and it may not be able to meet those tests at all a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the amended and restated senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under the amended and restated senior credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the amended and restated senior credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if celanese holdings were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the amended and restated senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the amended and restated senior credit facilities if the lenders under the amended and restated senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the amended and restated senior credit facilities as well as their other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock 

 

the terms of our amended and restated senior credit facilities limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us 

 

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries however the terms of our amended and restated senior credit facilities limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us accordingly our ability to pay dividends on our stock is similarly limited

dividend policy 

 

in july 2005 our board of directors adopted a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of our series a common stock at an annual rate of 016 per share unless our board of directors in its sole discretion determines otherwise pursuant to this policy we paid quarterly dividends of 004 per share on february 1 2006 may 1 2006 august 1 2006 november 1 2006 and february 1 2007 based on the number of outstanding shares of our series a common stock the anticipated annual cash dividend is approximately 26 million however there is no assurance that sufficient cash will be available in the future to pay such dividend further such dividends payable to holders of our series a common stock cannot be declared or paid nor can any funds be set aside for the payment thereof unless we have paid or set aside funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of our preferred stock as described below 

 

our board of directors may at any time modify or revoke our dividend policy on our series a common stock 

 

we are required under the terms of the preferred stock to pay scheduled quarterly dividends subject to legally available funds for so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding 1 we will not declare pay or set apart funds for the payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to any junior stock or parity stock and 2 neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will subject to certain exceptions redeem purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise in each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of preferred stock and any parity stock for all preceding dividend periods pursuant to this policy we paid quarterly dividends of 0265625 on our 425 convertible perpetual preferred stock on february 1 2006 may 1 2006 august 1 2006 november 1 2006 and february 1 2007 the anticipated annual cash dividend is approximately 10 million 

 

the amount available to us to pay cash dividends is restricted by our subsidiaries’ debt agreements the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes also limit but do not prohibit the ability of bcp crystal crystal llc and their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

 

under delaware law our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our “surplus” which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities minus statutory capital or if there is no surplus out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal years the value of a corporation’s assets can be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value the value of our capital may be adjusted from time to time by our board of directors but in no event will be less than the aggregate par value of our issued stock our board of directors may base this determination on our financial statements a fair valuation of our assets or another reasonable method our board of directors will seek to assure itself that the statutory requirements will be met before actually declaring dividends in future periods our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends and such opinions may not be forthcoming if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion we likely would not be able to pay dividends in addition pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are prohibited from paying a dividend on our series a common stock unless all payments due and payable under the preferred stock have been made

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

in this annual report on form 10k the term “celanese” refers to celanese corporation a delaware corporation and not its subsidiaries the terms the “company” “we” “our” “us” and successor refer to celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the term “bcp crystal” refers to our subsidiary bcp crystal us holdings corp a delaware corporation and not its subsidiaries the term “purchaser” refers to our subsidiary celanese europe holding gmbh  co kg formerly known as bcp crystal acquisition gmbh  co kg a german limited partnership and not its subsidiaries except where otherwise indicated the term “original shareholders” refers collectively to blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 1 blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 2 blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 3 and ba capital investors sidecar fund lp the terms “sponsor” and “advisor” refer to certain affiliates of the blackstone group 

 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and the results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” 

 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers periods prior and subsequent to the acquisition of cag and its subsidiaries collectively “cag” or the “predecessor” accordingly the discussion and analysis of historical periods prior to the acquisition do not reflect the significant impact that the acquisition of cag has had and will have on the successor including increased leverage and liquidity requirements as well as purchase accounting adjustments furthermore the successor and the predecessor have different accounting policies with respect to certain matters see note 4 to the notes to consolidated financial statements investors are cautioned that the forwardlooking statements contained in this section involve both risk and uncertainty several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are therefore beyond the control of management see “forwardlooking information” located below 

 

the results for the nine months ended december 31 2005 and the three months ended march 31 2005 have not been audited and should not be taken as an indication of the results of operations to be reported for any subsequent period or for the full fiscal year 

 

reconciliation of nonus gaap measures we believe that using nonus gaap financial measures to supplement us gaap results is useful to investors because such use provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business other than disclosing us gaap results alone in this regard we disclose net debt which is a nonus gaap financial measure net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents we use net debt to evaluate the capital structure net debt is not a substitute for any us gaap financial measure in addition calculations of net debt contained in this report may not be consistent with that of other companies the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with us gaap in our financial statements for net debt is total debt for a reconciliation of net debt to total debt see “financial highlights” below for a reconciliation of trade working capital to working capital components see “selected financial data” 

 

forwardlooking statements may prove inaccurate 

 

this annual report contains certain forwardlooking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us these statements include but are not limited to statements about our strategies plans objectives expectations intentions expenditures and assumptions and other statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts when used in this document words such as “anticipate” “believe” ”estimate” “expect” “intend” “plan” and “project” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict further certain forwardlooking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate 

 

see the risk factors section under part 1 item 1a for a description of risk factors that could significantly affect our financial results in addition the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those 

results performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements these factors include among other things 

 

  

many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are therefore beyond our control should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this annual report as anticipated believed estimated expected intended planned or projected we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of their dates 

 

basis of presentation 

 

the successor period represents our audited consolidated financial position as of december 31 2006 and 2005 and our audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 and its unaudited interim consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended december 31 2005 and the three months ended march 31 2005 these consolidated financial statements reflect the application of purchase accounting relating to the original acquisition of cag and purchase price accounting adjustments relating to the acquisitions of vinamul acetex and additional cag shares acquired during the year ended december 31 2005 

 

the predecessor period represents cag’s audited interim consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended march 31 2004 these consolidated financial statements relate to periods prior to the acquisition of cag and present cag’s historical basis of accounting without the application of purchase accounting 

 

the results of the successor are not comparable to the results of the predecessor due to the difference in the basis of presentation of purchase accounting as compared to historical cost furthermore the successor and the predecessor have different accounting policies with respect to certain matters 

 

change in ownership and initial public offering 

 

pursuant to a voluntary tender offer commenced in february 2004 the purchaser an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of celanese corporation on april 6 2004 acquired approximately 84 of the ordinary shares of celanese ag excluding treasury shares for a purchase price of 1693 million including direct acquisition costs of 69 million the “acquisition” during the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 the purchaser acquired additional cag shares for 473 million and 33 million respectively including direct acquisition costs of 4 million and less than 1 million respectively as of december 31 2006 our ownership percentage in cag was approximately 98 as a result of the effective registration of the squeezeout as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the commercial register in december 2006 we acquired the remaining 2 of cag in january 2007 

 

on november 3 2004 blackstone crystal holdings capital partners cayman iv ltd reorganized as a delaware corporation and changed its name to celanese corporation additionally bcp crystal holdings ltd 2 a subsidiary of celanese corporation was reorganized as a delaware limited liability company and changed its name to celanese holdings llc

for the year ended december 31 2006 net sales increased by 103 to 6656 million compared to the same period in 2005 an increase in pricing of 4 for the year ended december 31 2006 driven by continued strong demand for the majority of our products and higher raw material and energy costs contributed to the improvement in net sales also an increase in overall volumes of 1 for the year ended december 31 2006 driven by our ticona and performance products business segments contributed to the increase in net sales the volume increases are the results of increased market penetration from several of ticona’s key products an improved business environment in europe continued growth in asia and continued growth in new and existing applications from our sunett ® sweetener additionally net sales from acetex of 542 million contributed to the increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 247 million of net sales from acetex for the same period in 2005 the acetex business was acquired in july 2005 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained flat for the year ended december 31 2006 217 compared to the same period in 2005 216 overall higher raw material and energy costs were mostly offset by higher volumes and pricing volumes increased for such products as acetyls acetyl derivative products pom vectra and gur while overall pricing increased driven by increases in acetyls and acetyl derivative products 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 27 million to 538 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period last year the increase consists of stockbased compensation expense of 20 million resulting from our adoption of sfas no 123r and 14 million related to our longterm incentive plan additionally the year ended december 31 2006 included additional selling general and administrative expenses from the acetex business which was acquired in july 2005 as well as costs related to executive severance and legal costs associated with the squeezeout of cag shareholders of 23 million these expenses were mostly offset by ongoing cost savings initiatives from the ticona and acetate products segments and lower costs from the divestiture of the coc business 

 

other charges gains net 

 

the components of other charges gains net for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

 

 

other charges gains net for the year ended december 31 2006 decreased 56 million compared to the same period in 2005 the decrease is due to the absence of environmental related plant closures of 12 million the 

absence of asset impairment charges of 25 million related to the divestiture of our coc business and the absence of 35 million related to the termination of advisor monitoring services all of which were recorded in 2005 

 

operating profit 

 

operating profit for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 303 compared to the same period last year this is principally driven by higher overall volumes and pricing lower other charges gains net and productivity improvements also the year ended december 31 2006 included operating profit from acetex of 5 million an increase of 8 million compared to the same period in 2005 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased 41 in the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period last year the increase was primarily due to additional income of 8 million from the infraserv affiliates 4 million from our ticona affiliates as well as the absence of a 10 million loss from estech gmbh recorded in 2005 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased to 294 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 387 million in the same period last year the decrease is primarily due to the absence of 28 million related to accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and 74 million related to early redemption premiums associated with the partial redemption of the senior subordinated notes senior discount notes and floating rate term loan both recorded in 2005 

 

income taxes 

 

income tax expense increased by 192 million to 253 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and the effective tax rate for this period was 38 slightly higher than the combined federal and state statutory rate of 37 the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by unrepatriated low taxed earnings primarily in singapore the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by 1 dividends and other passive income inclusions from foreign subsidiaries and equity investments and 2 higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions primarily germany the effective rate reflects a partial benefit for the reversal of valuation allowance on earnings in the us of 5 million reversals of valuation allowance established at the acquisition resulting from positive earnings or a change in judgment regarding the realizability of the net deferred tax asset are primarily reflected as a reduction of goodwill which amounted to 84 million in 2006 

 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

 

earnings loss from discontinued operations primarily relates to acetate products’ filament operations which were discontinued during the fourth quarter of 2005 and chemical products’ pentaerythritol “pe” operations which were discontinued during the third quarter of 2006 as a result revenues and expenses related to the filament and pe operations are reflected as a component of discontinued operations 

 

summary of consolidated results for the three months ended march 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with the three months ended march 31 2004 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased 228 to 4564 million in the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the improvement is primarily due to an 11 increase in net sales from the vinamul and acetex acquisitions and 11 higher pricing mainly in the chemical products segment net sales from vinamul and acetex including at plastics were approximately 280 million and approximately 247 million respectively these increases are partially offset by a 1 decline in volumes primarily from the chemical products’ acetyl derivatives business line and a decline in ticona’s polyacetal volumes partially offset by improved volumes from 

acetate products and performance products for chemical products this is primarily due to weaker european market conditions the decline for ticona is due to a weak european automotive market and reduced sales to lowerend applications acetate products volumes improved 7 due to higher flake sales to our recently expanded china tow ventures which were partially offset by lower tow volumes due to the shutdown of the canadian tow plant volumes from performance products improved primarily for the sunett ® sweetener and sorbates due to continued growth from new and existing applications mainly in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets 

 

net sales rose 215 to 1469 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 primarily on higher pricing of 15 mainly in the chemical products segment favorable currency movements higher volumes and a composition change in the chemical products segment each increased net sales by 2 

 

the segment composition changes consisted of the acquisition of vinamul in february 2005 which was partly offset by the effects of a contract manufacturing arrangement under which certain acrylates products are now being sold only the margin realized under the contract manufacturing arrangement is included in net sales 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit increased to 204 of net sales for the nine months ended december 31 2005 from 193 of net sales for the same period in 2004 gross profit increased to 253 of net sales for the three months ended march 31 2005 from 194 of net sales for the same period in 2004 the increases are primarily due to higher overall pricing mainly in the chemical products segment offsetting higher raw material and energy costs mainly from natural gas and ethylene the increase during the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 was also due to the additional gross profit of 26 million and 24 million from vinamul and acetex including at plastics respectively 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 91 million to 363 million in the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 this decrease is due to ongoing cost savings initiatives organizational redesign of the ticona and acetate products segments and decreases in legal audit and general expenses associated with the acquisition of cag and the ipo in addition 2004 included approximately 50 million in new management incentive compensation expenses which includes charges for a new deferred compensation plan a new stock incentive plan and other executive bonuses these decreases are partially offset by the addition of costs associated with vinamul and acetex of 23 million and 22 million respectively which included integration costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions 

 

selling general and administrative expense increased to 148 million in the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to 136 million for the same period in 2004 this increase is primarily due to expenses for sponsor monitoring services of 10 million as well as higher costs primarily related to compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

 

other charges gains net 

 

the components of other charges gains net for the nine months ended december 31 2005 and 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2005 and 2004 were as follows

other charges gains net increased 10 million for the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the charge for the three months ended march 31 2005 relates to fees paid to the advisor to terminate the monitoring services and all obligations to pay future monitoring fees under the transaction and monitoring fee agreement the three months ended march 31 2004 primarily relates to 26 million for advisory services related to the acquisition of cag 

 

operating profit 

 

operating profit increased to 417 million in the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to 72 million in the same period in 2004 principally driven by higher pricing and productivity improvements resulting in a 212 million increase in the gross profit margin 91 million of lower selling general and administrative expenses and 54 million of lower other charges gains net partially offsetting the increase is an 11 million loss on disposition of assets compared to a 3 million gain recorded in the same period in 2004 and higher raw material and energy costs mainly for ethylene and natural gas in 2005 included in 2005 is a 23 million gain on the disposition of two acetate products properties a 5 million gain on the sale of performance products’ omega3 dha business offset by a 35 million loss on the disposal of ticona’s coc business and 2 million of other losses for the nine months ended december 31 2005 vinamul and acetex including at plastics had operating losses of 15 million and 4 million respectively primarily related to integration costs in connection with the acquisitions and inventory purchase accounting adjustments for acetex 

 

operating profit increased to 156 million for the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to 46 million in the same period in 2004 on gross margin expansion of 138 million as significantly higher pricing primarily in chemical products lower depreciation expense and productivity improvements more than offset higher raw material and energy costs operating profit also benefited from increased volumes in acetate products 

performance products and ticona depreciation and amortization expense declined by 9 million as decreases in depreciation resulting from purchase accounting adjustments more than offset increased amortization expense for acquired intangible assets 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates increased by 10 million to 46 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the increase is primarily due to restructuring charges in our european oxo venture in 2004 during the nine months ended december 31 2005 we received cash distributions from our equity affiliates of 29 million compared to 22 million in the same period in 2004 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliates rose by 3 million to 15 million for the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 cash distributions received from equity affiliates increased to 36 million for the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to 16 million in the same period in 2004 the increase in cash distributions is mainly due to strong business conditions in 2004 for ticona’s high performance product ventures and chemical products’ methanol venture and the timing of dividend payments 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased 89 million to 211 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to 300 million in the same period in 2004 the decrease in interest expense is due to expensing deferred financing costs of 89 million and a prepayment premium of 21 million associated with the refinancing of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in 2004 the decrease was offset by a 21 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels and interest rates in 2005 

 

interest expense increased to 176 million for the three months ended march 31 2005 from 6 million in the same period in 2004 primarily due to expenses of 102 million including early redemption premiums and deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing that occurred in the first quarter of 2005 higher debt levels resulting primarily from the acquisition of cag and higher interest rates also increased interest expense 

 

other income expense net 

 

other income expense net increased to income of 86 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to expense of 12 million for the comparable period in 2004 this increase is largely due to 42 million in higher dividend income in 2005 primarily from our saudi cost investment due to higher methanol pricing in addition 36 million of the increase is related to favorable exchange rate movements and 17 million is due to favorable changes in cross currency swap valuations in 2005 

 

other income expense net decreased to 3 million of income for the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to 9 million for the comparable period in 2004 this decrease is primarily due to expenses associated with the anticipated guaranteed payment to cag minority shareholders and the ineffective portion of a net investment hedge these decreases were partially offset by higher dividends from cost investments dividend income accounted for under the cost method increased by 8 million to 14 million for the three months ended march 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the increase in the first quarter of 2005 primarily resulted from the timing of receipt of dividends

application of full valuation allowances against postacquisition net us deferred tax assets canadian deferred tax assets due to postacquisition restructuring certain german deferred tax assets and the nonrecognition of tax benefits associated with acquisition related expenses these unfavorable effects were partially offset by unrepatriated low taxed earnings primarily in singapore 

 

income taxes for the three months ended march 31 2005 and 2004 are recorded based on the annual effective tax rate as of march 31 2005 the annual effective tax rate for 2005 was 35 which was slightly less than the combination of the statutory rate and state income tax rates in the us the estimated annual effective tax rate for 2005 reflects earnings in low tax jurisdictions a valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with projected us losses which includes expenses associated with the early redemption of debt and tax expense in certain nonus jurisdictions the predecessor had an effective tax rate of 24 for the three months ended march 31 2004 compared to the german statutory rate of 40 which was primarily affected by earnings in low tax jurisdictions

debt capital and other obligations 

 

in january 2005 we completed an initial public offering of series a common stock and received net proceeds of approximately 752 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of 48 million concurrently we received net proceeds of 233 million from the offering of our convertible preferred stock and 

borrowed an additional 1135 million under the amended and restated senior credit facilities a portion of the proceeds of the share offerings were used to redeem 188 million of senior discount notes and 521 million of senior subordinated notes which excludes early redemption premiums of 19 million and 51 million respectively we also used a portion of the proceeds from additional borrowings under our senior credit facilities to repay our 350 million floating rate term loan which excludes a 4 million early redemption premium and used 200 million of the proceeds as the primary financing for the acquisition of the vinamul emulsions business 

 

on april 7 2005 we used the remaining proceeds to pay a special cash dividend to holders of our series b common stock of 804 million upon payment of the 804 million dividend all of the shares of series b common stock converted automatically to shares of series a common stock in addition we may use the available sources of liquidity to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of cag 

 

as discussed above in 2005 we issued 240 million aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive when as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor cash dividends at the rate of 425 per annum or 106 per share of liquidation preference payable quarterly in arrears commencing on may 1 2005 dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial issuance this dividend is expected to result in an annual dividend payment of approximately 10 million accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at an annual rate of 425 the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our series a common stock at a conversion rate of approximately 125 shares of our series a common stock per 2500 liquidation preference of the preferred stock for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we paid 10 million and 8 million respectively in aggregate dividends on our preferred stock in addition at december 31 2006 we had 2 million of accumulated but undeclared and unpaid dividends which were declared on january 5 2007 and paid on february 1 2007

other obligations 

 

we expect to continue to incur costs for the following significant obligations although we cannot predict with certainty the annual spending for these matters such matters will affect our future cash flows 

 

 

 

we are secondarily liable under a lease agreement pursuant to which we have assigned a direct obligation to a third party the lease assumed by the third party expires on april 30 2012 the lease liability for the period from january 1 2007 to april 30 2012 is estimated to be approximately 41 million

for additional commitments and contingencies see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental matters 

 

for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 the successor’s worldwide expenditures including expenditures for legal compliance internal environmental initiatives and remediation of active orphan divested and us superfund sites were 71 million 84 million and 66 million respectively the predecessor’s worldwide expenditures for the three months ended march 31 2004 were 22 million the successor’s capital project related environmental expenditures for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the predecessor’s for the three months ended march 31 2004 included in worldwide expenditures were 5 million 8 million 6 million and 2 million respectively environmental reserves for remediation matters were 114 million and 124 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively which represents our best estimate see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

it is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on the chemical industry in general we cannot predict with certainty future environmental expenditures especially expenditures beyond 2007 due to new air regulations in the us we expect that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 10 million to 15 million through 2008 

 

accordingly emission trading systems will directly affect the power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites in germany and the lanaken site in belgium as well as power plants operated by infraserv entities on sites at which we operate we along with the infraserv entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits 

which could result in increased operating costs or may be required to develop additional costeffective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further which could result in increased capital expenditures additionally the new regulation indirectly affects our other operations in the european union which may experience higher energy costs from third party providers we have not yet determined the impact of this legislation on our operating costs 

 

due to our industrial history we have the obligation to remediate specific areas on our active sites as well as on divested orphan or us superfund sites in addition as part of the demerger agreement with hoechst a specified proportion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of predemerger divestitures was transferred to us we have provided for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable we believe that the environmental costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but they may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

pension and other benefits 

 

the funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 there were no pension contributions to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan contributions to other nonqualified plans including rest of the world for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 were 53 million and 44 million respectively 

 

on december 31 2006 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 which caused us to recognize the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of our benefit plans in the december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax the net impact of the adoption of sfas no 158 was an increase in pension and postretirement benefit obligations of 113 million with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax based on the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as of december 31 2006 we reported a total unfunded amount of 884 million of pension and postretirement benefit obligations our adoption of sfas no 158 on december 31 2006 had no impact on our earnings 

 

our spending associated with other benefit plans primarily retiree medical defined contribution and longterm disability amounted to 59 million and 67 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in 2004 we amended our longterm disability plan to align the benefit levels with the retiree medical plan as a result of this change the employee contribution for the longterm disability medical coverage increased substantially for current participants in the disability plan subsequent to the adoption of the change enrollment in the plan has been trending downward with 20 of the participants declining coverage accordingly as a result of the lower enrollment experience we reduced the disability accrual by 3 million and 9 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition medical claims assumptions were lowered to reflect actual plan experience and the percentage of longterm disability medical payments paid for by medicare this change lowered the longterm disability accrual by an additional 9 million 

 

other matters 

 

plumbing actions and sorbates litigation 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business for the year ended december 31 2006 there were 14 million of cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation in february 2005 we settled with an insurance carrier and received cash proceeds of 44 million in march 2005 and in december 2005 we received 30 million in additional settlements for the year ended december 31 2004 there were no net cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation as of december 31 2006 and 2005 there were reserves of 214 million and 197 million respectively for these matters in addition we have receivables from insurance companies and hoechst in connection with the plumbing and sorbates matters of 141 million and 140 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

although it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters we believe based on the advice of legal counsel that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have not entered into any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

market risks 

 

please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” under item 7a of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements and application of these policies requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 

 

we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 

 

recoverability of longlived assets 

 

our business is capital intensive and has required and will continue to require significant investments in property plant and equipment at december 31 2006 and 2005 the carrying amount of property plant and equipment was 2155 million and 2031 million respectively we assess the recoverability of property plant and equipment to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

 

in december 2004 we approved a plan to dispose of the coc business included within the ticona segment this decision resulted in 25 million and 32 million of asset impairment charges recorded as other charges gains net related to the coc business in the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 respectively 

 

as a result of the consolidation of tow production and the termination of filament production the acetate products segment recorded impairment charges of 50 million associated with plant and equipment in the nine months ended december 31 2004 

 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable as a result of our annual impairment test on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we recorded an impairment loss of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had 1338 million and 1430 million respectively of goodwill and other intangible assets net 

 

as of december 31 2006 there were no significant changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that led us to believe goodwill might have been impaired we will continue to evaluate the need for 

impairment if changes in circumstances or available information indicate that impairment may have occurred we perform the required impairment test at least annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing during 2006 we performed the impairment test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 

 

a prolonged general economic downturn and specifically a continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure create an imbalance of industry supply and demand or otherwise diminish volumes or profits such events combined with changes in interest rates could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our longlived assets consequently it is possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of our longlived assets 

 

other charges gains net 

 

other charges gains net include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a decision to exit nonstrategic businesses these measures are based on formal management decisions establishment of agreements with the employees’ representatives or individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan the related reserves reflect certain estimates including those pertaining to separation costs settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at the end of each reporting period actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental liabilities 

 

we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated depending on the nature of the site we accrue through time horizons of ten to fifteen years unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond these time horizons all other fees are expensed as incurred if the event of loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable but is reasonably possible we provide appropriate disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements if the contingency is considered material the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on a range of our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort we use our best estimate within the range to establish our environmental reserves we utilize third parties to assist in the management and the development of our cost estimates for our sites we accrue for legal fees related to loss contingency matters when the costs associated with defense can be reasonably estimated and are probable to occur see also note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

asset retirement obligations 

 

total reserves for asset retirement obligations were 59 million and 54 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively sfas no 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “fin no 47” provides guidelines as to when a company is required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation the liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded the corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life we have identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to substantially all of our existing operating facilities examples of these types of obligations include demolition decommissioning disposal and restoration activities legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations however operations at these facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time we will continue to assess strategies that may differ from past business decisions regarding the continuing operation of existing facilities asset retirement obligations will be recorded if these 

strategies are changed and probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities if certain operating facilities were to close the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

realization of deferred tax assets 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized such evaluations require significant management judgments valuation allowances have been established primarily for us federal and state net operating losses carryforwards mexican net operating loss carryforwards and canadian deferred tax assets see note 21 in the consolidated financial statements 

 

tax contingencies 

 

we have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities we accrue for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest these amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations conclusion of tax audits additional exposure based on current calculations identification of new issues release of administrative guidance or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue this policy may be impacted by the adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” as discussed in note 5 in the consolidated financial statements 

 

benefit obligations 

 

we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the employee retirement income security act contributions to the various pension and other postretirement benefit plans are further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financials statements benefits are generally based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate rates of increase in compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 

 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2006 and 2005 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan which represents greater than 84 and 76 of pension plan assets and liabilities respectively on average the actual return on plan assets over the longterm 15 to 20 years has exceeded 90 for the year ended december 31 2006 the us qualified defined benefit pension plan assets actual return was 630 basis points more than the expected longterm rate of return of plan assets however for the year ended december 31 2005 the actual return was 50 basis points less than the expected longterm rate of return of plan assets based on our investment strategy we believe that 85 is a reasonable longterm rate of return 

 

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 6 million in 2006 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities at december 31 2006 we increased the discount rate to 588 from 563 at december 31 2005 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the us pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated 1 million and less than 1 million respectively and our benefit obligations by approximately 165 million and approximately 12 million respectively we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the nonus pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated 2 million and less than 1 million respectively and will increase our benefit obligations by approximately 56 million and approximately 3 million respectively 

 

in 2005 and 2004 we experienced significant increases in excess of 300 million in unrecognized net actuarial pension losses the losses were mainly due to the decline in the discount rate utilized to reflect current market conditions however in 2006 the discount rate increased resulting in a lower unrecognized loss of 64 million the increase in discount rate and higher actual returns on plan assets resulted in lower pension and postretirement benefit obligations in 2006 of approximately 295 million compared to 2005 

 

other postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the postretirement benefit cost for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 includes 21 million 25 million 21 million and 8 million respectively the accrued postretirement liability was 343 million and 408 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and is included in other noncurrent liabilities the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would result in the apbo at december 31 2006 and the 2006 postretirement benefit cost to change by approximately 4 million and 1 million respectively see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting for commitments and contingencies 

 

we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with sfas no 5 “ contingencies and commitments ” and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the outstanding commitments and contingencies and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

business combinations 

 

upon closing an acquisition we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as soon as practicable given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company’s balance sheet frequently with implications for the purchase price of the acquisition then to adjust the acquired company’s accounting policies procedures books and records to our standards it is often several quarters before we are able to finalize 

those initial fair value estimates accordingly it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised within twelve months of an acquisition the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact net earnings loss see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

captive insurance companies 

 

we have two wholly owned insurance companies the “captives” that are used as a form of self insurance for property liability and workers compensation risks one of the captives also insures certain third party risks the liabilities recorded by the captives relate to the estimated risk of loss which is based on our estimates and actuarial valuations and unearned premiums which represent the portion of the third party premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies inforce liabilities are recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and we can reasonably estimate its liability in addition liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure on both known and unasserted claims estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities premiums written are recognized as revenue based on the terms of the policies capitalization of the captives is determined by regulatory guidelines 

 

the captives enter into reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the captives from its obligation to policyholders failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the captives the captives evaluate the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies and to establish allowances for amounts deemed noncollectible

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risks 

 

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 148 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of fixedfloating rate debt depending on market conditions at both december 31 2006 and 2005 we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a notional amount of 300 million at december 31 2004 we had no interest rate swap agreements in place as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 16 billion of variable rate debt net of the interest rate swap a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 16 million 

 

see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest rate risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

we have receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the various subsidiaries which create foreign exchange risk for the purposes of this document our reporting currency is the us dollar and the functional reporting currency of cag continues to be the euro the us dollar the euro mexican peso japanese yen british pound sterling chinese yuan and canadian dollar are the most significant sources of currency risk accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the foreign currency contracts are mainly for booked exposure and in some cases cash flow hedges for anticipated exposure associated with sales from the performance products segment the terms of these contracts are generally under one year our centralized hedging strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables or liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be internally hedged only the remaining net foreign exchange position will then be hedged externally with banks as a result foreign currency forward contracts relating to this centralized strategy did not meet the criteria of sfas no 133 to qualify for hedge accounting net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized on the underlying transactions which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts 

 

a substantial portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have and in the past have had a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 

 

to protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation we entered into cross currency swaps with certain financial institutions under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements we will pay approximately €13 million in interest and receive approximately 16 million in interest on each june 15 and december 15 upon maturity of the cross currency swap agreement in june 2008 we will pay approximately €276 million and receive approximately 333 million we designated the cross currency swaps part of our senior euro term loan and the euro senior subordinated note as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2004 

 

see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

commodity risk management 

 

our policy for the majority of our commodity raw materials requirements allows us to enter into forward purchase andor swap contracts to manage our risk although these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices we have elected to apply the normal purchases provision to the forward purchase and swap contracts that qualify as derivative instruments as it was probable at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that they would not settle net and would result in physical delivery realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2006 

 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected 

 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 kpmg llp has audited this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting their report is included below

the board of directors and shareholders celanese corporation 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  that celanese corporation and subsidiaries “successor” or the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that celanese corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso also in our opinion celanese corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso

we have a large and diverse global customer base consisting principally of major companies in a broad array of industries for the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 36 of our net sales were to customers located in north america approximately 40 to customers in europe and africa and approximately 24 to customers in asia australia and the rest of the world

segment overview

we operate principally through four business segments chemical products technical polymers ticona acetate products and performance products the table below illustrates each segment’s net sales to external customers for the year ended december 31 2005 as well as each segment’s major products and end use markets

 

   chemical products 

our chemical products segment produces and supplies acetyl products including acetic acid acetate esters vam polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions we are a leading global producer of acetic acid the world’s largest producer of vam and the largest north american producer of methanol the major raw material used for the production of acetic acid we are also the largest polyvinyl alcohol producer in north america these products are generally used as building blocks for valueadded products or in intermediate chemicals used in the paints coatings inks adhesives films textiles and building products industries other chemicals produced in this segment are organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical products for the year ended december 31 2005 net sales to external customers of acetyls were 1966 million acetyl derivatives and polyols were 1003 million and all other business lines combined were 1231 million

technical polymers ticona 

our technical polymers ticona segment ‘‘ticona’’ develops produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical polymers for application in automotive and electronics products and in other consumer and industrial applications often replacing metal or glass together with our 45owned venture polyplastics co ltd polyplastics our 50owned venture korea engineering plastics company ltd or kepco and fortron industries our 5050 venture with kureha chemicals industry of japan we are a leading participant in the global technical polymers business the primary products of ticona are polyacetal products or pom and gur an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene pom is used in a broad range of products including automotive components electronics and appliances gur is used in battery separators conveyor belts filtration equipment coatings and medical devices for the year ended december 31 2005 sales to external customers in this segment were 887 million

acetate products 

our acetate products segment primarily produces and supplies acetate tow which is used in the production of filter products we are one of the world’s leading producers of acetate tow including production by our ventures in china in october 2004 we announced plans to consolidate our acetate flake and tow manufacturing by early 2007 and to exit the acetate filament business which ceased production in april 2005 this restructuring is being implemented to increase efficiency reduce overcapacities in certain manufacturing areas and to focus on products and markets that provide longterm value for the year ended december 31 2005 sales to external customers in this segment were 659 million

performance products 

the performance products segment operates under the trade name of nutrinova and produces and sells sunett high intensity sweetener and food protection ingredients such as sorbates for the food beverage and pharmaceuticals industries for the year ended december 31 2005 sales to external customers in this segment were 180 million

competitive strengths

we benefit from a number of competitive strengths including the following

leading market positions 

we have the first or second market positions globally in products that make up a majority of our sales we are a leading global producer of acetic acid and the world’s largest producer of vam ticona and our ventures polyplastics and kepco are leading suppliers of pom and other engineering resins in north america europe and the asiapacific region our leadership positions are based on our large share of global production capacity operating efficiencies proprietary technology and competitive cost structures in our major products

proprietary production technology and operating expertise 

our production of acetyl products employs industry leading proprietary and licensed technologies including our proprietary ao plus acidoptimization technology for the production of acetic acid and vantage vinyl acetate monomer technology ao plus enables plant capacity to be increased with minimal investment while vantage enables significant increases in production efficiencies lower operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to fifteen percent of the cost of building a new plant

low cost producer 

our competitive cost structures are based on economies of scale vertical integration technical knowhow and the use of advanced technologies

global reach 

we operate thirtyone production facilities throughout the world the ventures in which we participate operate ten additional facilities we have a strong and growing presence in asia particularly in china our infrastructure of manufacturing plants terminals and sales offices provides us with a competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the needs of our global and local customers in wellestablished and growing markets while our geographic diversity reduces the potential impact of volatility in any individual country or region

international strategic investments 

our strategic investments including our ventures have enabled us to gain access minimize costs and accelerate growth in new markets while also generating significant cash flow and earnings our equity investments and cost investments represent an important component of our growth strategy during the year ended december 31 2005 we received 66 million and 89 million in dividends from our strategic equity and cost investments respectively also for the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded 61 million of earnings from our equity investments in equity in net earnings from affiliates see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and investments commencing on page 18 of this item 1 for additional information on our equity and cost investments

diversified products and enduse markets 

we offer our customers a broad range of products in a wide variety of enduse markets for example ticona offers customers a broad range of highquality engineering plastics to meet the needs of customers in numerous enduse markets such as automotive electricalelectronics appliance and medical chemical products has leading market positions in an integrated chain of basic and performancebased acetyl products sold into diverse industrial applications this product diversity and market exposure help us to reduce the potential impact of volatility in any individual market segment

business strategies

we are focused on increasing operating cash flows profitability return on investment and shareholder value which we believe can be achieved through the following business strategies

maintain cost advantage and productivity leadership 

we continually seek to reduce our production and raw material costs in july 2005 we commenced purchasing most of our north american internal methanol requirements from southern chemical corporation under a multiyear agreement at a lower cost than we could manufacture ourselves our advanced process control apc projects generate savings in energy and raw materials while increasing yields in production units most significantly six sigma is a pervasive and important tool in both operations and administration for achieving greater productivity and growth we continue to focus on opportunities and process technology improvements focused on energy reduction we will continue using best practices to reduce costs and increase equipment reliability in maintenance and project engineering

focused business investment 

we intend to continue investing strategically in growth areas including new production capacity to extend our global market leadership position historically our strong market position has enabled us to initiate capacity growth to take advantage of projected demand growth for example we are building a 600000 metric ton per year worldscale acetic acid plant in china the world’s fastest growing market for acetic acid and its derivatives the plant is scheduled for commercial sales in the first quarter of 2007 our plans include adding the right capacity at the right time in the right location at the right cost

deliver valueadded solutions 

we continually develop new products and industry leading production technologies that solve our customers’ problems for example ticona has worked closely with fuel system suppliers to develop an 

acetal copolymer with the chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure to hot diesel fuels in our emulsions business we pioneered a technological solution that leads the industry in product offerings for ecologically friendly emulsions for solventfree interior paints we believe that our customers value our expertise and we will continue to work with them to enhance the quality of their products

enhance value of portfolio 

we will continue to further optimize our business portfolio through divestitures acquisitions and strategic investments that enable us to focus on businesses in which we can achieve market cost and technology leadership over the long term in addition we intend to continue to expand our product mix into higher valueadded products we acquired vinamul the north american and european emulsion polymer business of national starch and chemical company nsc a subsidiary of imperial chemical industries plc vinamul in february 2005 and acetex corporation acetex a producer of acetyl products and specialty polymers and films in july 2005 we divested noncore businesses such as acrylates in 2004 as well as our interest in a fuel cell venture our omega3 dha performance product business and our cycloolefin copolymer business ‘‘coc’’ in 2005

business segments

c hemical p roducts 

the chemical products segment consists of six business lines acetyls acetyl derivatives and polyols polyvinyl alcohol emulsions specialties and other chemical activities all business lines in this segment mainly conduct business using the ‘‘celanese’’ trade name except polyvinyl alcohol which uses the trademark celvol emulsions which uses the trademarks mowilith and celvolit vinamul elite duroset and acetex the following table lists key products and their major end use markets

 

business lines 

acetyls undefinedthe acetyls business line produces

 8

    acetic acid methanol and vam like other commodity products are characterized by cyclicality in pricing the principal raw materials in these products are natural gas and ethylene which we purchase from numerous sources carbon monoxide which we both manufacture and purchase under longterm contracts methanol which we both manufacture and purchase under longterm and shortterm contracts and butane which we purchase from one supplier and can also obtain from other sources all these raw materials except carbon monoxide are commodities and are available from a wide variety of sources

our production of acetyl products employs leading proprietary and licensed technologies including our proprietary ao plus acidoptimization technology for the production of acetic acid and vantage vinyl acetate monomer technology ao plus enables plant capacity to be increased with minimal investment while vantage enables significant increases in production efficiencies lower operating costs and increases in capacity at 10 to 15 of the cost of building a new plant

acetyl derivatives and polyols undefinedthe acetyl derivatives and polyols business line produces a variety of solvents polyols formaldehyde and other chemicals which in turn are used in the manufacture of paints coatings adhesives and other products

many acetyl derivatives products are derived from our production of acetic acid and oxo alcohols primary products are

       polyols and formaldehyde products are derivatives of methanol and are made up of the following products

  oxo alcohols and intermediates are produced from propylene and ethylene and include

   9

acetyl derivatives and polyols are commodity products characterized by cyclicality in pricing the principal raw materials used in the acetyl derivatives business line are acetic acid various alcohols methanol acetaldehyde propylene ethylene and synthesis gas we manufacture many of these raw materials for our own use as well as for sales to third parties including our competitors in the acetyl derivatives business we purchase propylene and ethylene from a variety of sources we manufacture acetaldehyde for our european production but we purchase all acetaldehyde requirements for our north american operations from third parties acetaldehyde is also available from other sources

polyvinyl alcohol undefinedpolyvinyl alcohol or pvoh is sold under the celvol trademark and is a performance chemical engineered to satisfy particular customer requirements it is used in adhesives building products paper coatings films and textiles the primary raw material to produce pvoh is vam while acetic acid is produced as a byproduct prices vary depending on industry segment and end use application products are sold on a global basis and competition is from all regions of the world therefore regional economies and supply and demand balances affect the level of competition in other regions according to industry sources on pvoh we are the largest north american producer of pvoh and the third largest producer in the world

emulsions undefinedthe products in celanese’s emulsions business include conventional emulsions and highpressure vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions emulsions are made from vam acrylate esters and styrene they are a key component of waterbased quality surface coatings adhesives nonwoven textiles and other applications emulsions are sold under the mowilith and celvolit brands and since february 2005 the vinamul elite and duroset brands

specialties undefinedthe specialties business line produces

   the prices for these products are relatively stable due to longterm contracts with customers whose industries are not generally subject to the cyclical trends of commodity chemicals

the primary raw materials for these products are olefins and ammonia which are purchased from world market suppliers based on international prices

we contributed our commercial technical and operational oxo business activities in oberhausen germany to european oxo gmbh celanese’s european oxo chemicals venture with degussa ag degussa the venture began operations in october 2003

facilities

chemical products has production sites in the united states canada mexico singapore spain sweden slovenia the united kingdom the netherlands france and germany the emulsions business line also has tolling arrangements in france we also participate in a venture in saudi arabia that produces methanol and methyl tertiarybutyl ether or mtbe over the last few years we have continued to shift our production capacity to lower cost production facilities while expanding in growth markets such as china as a result we shut down our formaldehyde unit in edmonton alberta canada in mid2004 and announced in august 2005 that we intend to close this unit in late 2006 or early 2007

capital expenditures 

the chemical products segment’s capital expenditures by the successor for the year ended december 31 2005 were 111 million and for the nine months ended december 31 2004 were 64 million chemical products capital expenditures by the predecessor were 15 million for the three months ended 

march 31 2004 and 109 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the capital expenditures incurred during these periods related primarily to efficiency and safety improvementrelated items associated with the normal operations of the business capital expenditures in 2003 also included the integration of a companywide sap system

markets 

the following table illustrates net sales by destination of the chemical products segment by geographic region of the successor for the year ended december 31 2005 and for the nine months ended december 31 2004 and of the predecessor for the three months ended march 31 2004 and for the year ended december 31 2003

net sales to external customers by destination—chemical products

 

chemical products markets its products both directly to customers and through distributors it also utilizes a number of ‘‘echannels’’ including its website at wwwchemvipcom as well as system to system linking through its industry portal elemica

acetic acid and vam are global businesses which have several large customers generally we supply these global customers under multiyear contracts the customers of acetic acid and vam produce polymers used in waterbased paints adhesives paper coatings film modifiers and textiles we have longstanding relationships with most of these customers

pvoh is sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers mainly under single year contracts the customers of the pvoh business line are primarily engaged in the production of adhesives paper films building products and textiles polyvinyl acetate and ethylene vinyl alcohol both of which we acquired in july 2005 in the acetex acquisition are used in chewing gum and packaging materials respectively

emulsions are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers customers for emulsions are manufacturers of waterbased quality surface coatings adhesives and nonwoven textiles

acetyl derivatives and polyols are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers both under multiyear contracts and on the basis of longstanding relationships the customers of acetyl derivatives are primarily engaged in the production of paints coatings and adhesives in addition to our own demand for acetyl derivatives to produce cellulose acetate we sell acetyl derivatives to other participants in the cellulose acetate industry we manufacture formaldehyde for our own use as well as for sale to a few regional customers that include manufacturers in the wood products and chemical derivatives industries the sale of formaldehyde is based on both long and short term agreements polyols are sold globally to a wide variety of customers primarily in the coatings and resins and the specialty products industries oxo products are sold to a wide variety of customers primarily in the construction and automotive industries and are used internally to produce acetyl derivatives the oxo market is characterized by oversupply and numerous competitors

the specialties business line primarily serves global markets in the synthetic lubricant agrochemical rubber processing and other specialty chemical areas much of the specialties business line involves ‘‘one customer one product’’ relationships where the business develops customized products with the customer but the specialties business line also sells several chemicals which are priced more like commodity chemicals

the technical polymers ticona segment develops produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance technical polymers the following table lists key ticona products their trademarks and their major end use markets

 

  ticona technical polymers have chemical and physical properties enabling them among other things to withstand high temperatures resist chemical reactions with solvents and resist fracturing or stretching these products are used in a wide range of performancedemanding applications in the automotive and electronics sectors and in other consumer and industrial goods often replacing metal or glass

ticona works in concert with its customers to enable innovations and develop new or enhanced products ticona focuses its efforts on developing new markets and applications for its product lines often developing custom formulations to satisfy the technical and processing requirements of a customer’s applications for example ticona has worked closely with fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure to hot diesel fuels in the new generation of common rail diesel engines the product can also be used in automotive fuel sender units where it remains stable at the high operating temperatures present in directinjection diesel engines

ticona’s customer base consists primarily of a large number of plastic molders and component suppliers which are often the primary suppliers to original equipment manufacturers or oems ticona works with these molders and component suppliers as well as directly with the oems to develop and improve specialized applications and systems

prices for most of these products particularly specialized product grades for targeted applications generally reflect the value added in complex polymer chemistry precision formulation and compounding and the extensive application development services provided the specialized product lines are not particularly susceptible to cyclical swings in pricing pom pricing mainly in standard grades is however somewhat more price competitive with many minimumservice providers competing for volume sales

business lines 

pom are sold under the trademark hostaform and amcel in all regions but north america where we sell them under the trademark celcon polyplastics in which we hold a 45 ownership interest and kepco in which we hold a 50 ownership interest are leading suppliers of pom and other engineering resins in the asiapacific region pom are used for mechanical parts including door locks and seat belt mechanisms in automotive applications and in electrical consumer and medical applications such as drug delivery systems and gears for appliances

the primary raw material for pom is formaldehyde which is manufactured from methanol ticona currently purchases formaldehyde in the united states from our chemical products segment and in europe manufactures formaldehyde from purchased methanol

gur an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or peuhmw is an engineered material used in heavyduty automotive and industrial applications such as car battery separator panels and industrial conveyor belts as well as in specialty medical and consumer applications such as porous tips for marker pens sports equipment and prostheses gur micro powder grades are used for high performance filters membranes diagnostic devices coatings and additives for thermoplastics  elastomers peuhmw fibers are also used in protective ballistic applications the basic raw material for gur is ethylene

celstran and compel are long fiber reinforced thermoplastics which impart extra strength and stiffness making them more suitable for larger parts than conventional thermoplastics

polyesters such as celanex polybutylene terephthalate or pbt and vandar a series of pbtpolyester blends are used in a wide variety of automotive electrical and consumer applications including ignition system parts radiator grilles electrical switches appliance housings boat fittings and perfume bottle caps raw materials for polyesters vary base monomers such as dimethyl terephthalate or dmt and pta are widely available with pricing dependent on broader polyester fiber and packaging resins market conditions smaller volume specialty comonomers for these products are typically supplied by a few companies

liquid crystal polymers or lcps such as vectra are used in electrical and electronics applications and for precision parts with thin walls and complex shapes

fortron a polyphenylene sulfide or pps product is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications especially those requiring heat andor chemical resistance including fuel system parts radiator pipes and halogen lamp housings and often replaces metal in these demanding applications fortron is manufactured by fortron industries ticona’s 5050 venture with kureha chemicals industry co ltd kci of japan

in december 2004 we approved a plan to dispose of ticona’s coc business the sale of the coc business was completed in december 2005

facilities

ticona has polymerization compounding and research and technology centers in germany brazil and the united states ticona’s kelsterbach germany production site is located in close proximity to one of the sites being considered for a new runway under the frankfurt airport’s expansion plans the construction of this particular runway could have a negative effect on the plant’s current production capacity and future development while the state government of hesse and the owner of the airport promote the expansion of this option it is uncertain whether this option is in accordance with applicable laws although the state government of hesse expects the plan approval for the airport expansion in 2007 and the start of operations in 20092010 neither the final outcome of this matter nor its timing can be predicted at this time

capital expenditures

ticona’s capital expenditures by the successor for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 was 54 million and 64 million respectively ticona’s capital

the acetate products segment consists of acetate filter products or acetate tow which uses the ‘‘celanese’’ brand to market its products the acetate tow market continues to be characterized by stability and slow growth the segment’s acetate filament business line was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2005

business lines 

acetate filter products are used primarily in cigarette filters according to the 2002 stanford research institute international chemical economics handbook we are the world’s leading producer of acetate tow including production of our ventures in asia

we produce acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic anhydride we purchase wood pulp that is made from reforested trees from major suppliers and produce acetic anhydride internally the acetate flake is then further processed into acetate fiber in the form of a tow band

we have an approximately 30 interest in three manufacturing ventures in china that produce cellulose acetate flake and tow our partner in each of the ventures is a chinese stateowned tobacco entity in addition 17 of our 2005 acetate tow sales were sold directly to china the largest single market for acetate tow in the world two of the ventures completed tow expansions in january 2005 and the third venture completed its tow expansion in june 2005 flake expansion is expected to be completed in 2007 although our direct tow sales into china will decrease as a result of the venture expansions the future dividends that we expect to receive from these ventures are projected to increase

acetate products is continuing its cost reduction and operations improvement efforts these efforts are directed toward reducing costs while achieving higher productivity of employees and equipment in addition to restructuring activities previously undertaken we outsourced the operation and maintenance of our utility operations at the narrows virginia and rock hill south carolina plants in 2003 we also closed our charlotte north carolina administrative and research and development facility and relocated the functions there to the rock hill and narrows locations the relocation was substantially completed during the third quarter of 2004 in july 2005 we relocated our rock hill administrative functions to our dallas corporate headquarters in december 2005 we sold our rock hill and charlotte sites

facilities 

acetate products has production sites in the united states canada mexico and belgium and participates in three manufacturing ventures in china in october 2004 we announced plans to close the rock hill south carolina production site which occurred in april 2005 and to shutdown production of acetate products at the edmonton alberta canada site by 2007 additionally filament production at narrows and ocotlan was discontinued by mid2005 and flake production at ocotlan was recommissioned in the first quarter of 2005

infraservs undefinedwe hold ownership interests in several infraserv groups located in germany infraservs own and develop industrial parks and provide onsite general and administrative support to tenants

major cost investments 

china acetate products ventures undefinedwe hold approximately 30 ownership interests 50 board representation in three separate venture acetate products production entities in china the nantong kunming and zhuhai cellulose fiber companies in each instance chinese stateowned entities control the remainder the terms of these ventures were recently extended through 2020 with an estimated 30 share of the world’s cigarette production and consumption china is the world’s largest and fastest growing market for acetate tow products in combination these ventures represent the market leader in chinese domestic acetate production and are well positioned to capture future growth in the chinese cigarette market we and our partners expanded the manufacturing facilities at all three ventures in china in 2005 flake expansion is expected to be completed in 2007 the ventures are funding the investments from operating cash flows

national methanol co ibn sina  with production facilities in saudi arabia national methanol co represents 2 of the world’s methanol production capacity and is the world’s eighth largest producer of mtbe methanol and mtbe are key global commodity chemical products we indirectly own a 25 interest in national methanol co with the remainder held by the saudi basic industries corporation sabic 50 and texas eastern arabian corporation ltd 25 sabic has responsibility for all product marketing

these investments where celanese owns greater than a 20 ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of accounting because celanese cannot exercise significant influence

    predecessor

  raw materials and energy 

we purchase a variety of raw materials from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide steam and acetaldehyde although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier nor can there be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change for example the volatility of prices for natural gas and ethylene whose cost is in part linked to natural gas prices has increased in recent years our production facilities rely largely on coal fuel oil natural gas and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by our subsidiary which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure through the use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging entering into longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements management’s policy for the majority of its natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2005 and 2004 there were no derivative contracts outstanding in 2003 there were forward contracts covering approximately 35 of chemical products north american requirements management regularly assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity requirements forward and the utilization of a variety of other raw material hedging instruments in addition to forward purchase contracts in accordance with changes in market conditions management capped its exposure on approximately 20 of its us natural gas requirements during the months of august and september of 2004 the fixed price natural gas forward contracts and any premium associated with the purchase of a price cap are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap or cap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect or securing or limiting predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts were structured to limit exposure to increases in commodity prices certain swaps may also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap or cap contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges

we also lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the manufacture of chemical products with growing demand for these precious metals most notably in the automotive industry the cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased caused by a 

shortage in supply these circumstances are expected to continue into the second half of 2006 for precious metals the leases are distributed between a minimum of three lessors per product and are divided into several contracts a reassessment of the long term strategy regarding the lease or purchase of precious metals reflecting the changed market conditions for some metals is under way although we seek to offset increases in raw material prices with corresponding increases in the prices of our products we may not be able to do so and there may be periods when such product price increases lag behind raw material cost increases

research and development

all of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness ticona and performance products in particular are innovationoriented businesses that conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications

chemical products has been focusing on improving core production technologies such as improving catalyst development and supporting both debottlenecking and cost reduction efforts in the segment’s emulsions business line research and development is focused on new products new applications and new technology platforms in particular an emphasis is placed on continuously upgrading existing products particularly in the paints and coatings area

acetate products has been concentrating on developing new applications for acetate tow such as its use in disposable consumer materials

research in ticona is focused on the development of new formulations and applications for its products improved manufacturing processes and new polymer materials with varying chemical and physical properties in order to meet customer needs and to generate growth this effort involves the entire value chain from new or improved monomer production polymerization and compounding to working closely with endusers to identify new applications that can take advantage of these high performance features ticona is continually improving compounding recipes to extend product properties and grades while offering grade consistency on a global basis in addition ticona is developing new polymerization and manufacturing technology in order to meet economic and ecological goals without sacrificing high quality processing

the research and development activities of performance products are conducted at nutrinova’s frankfurt germany location they are directed towards expanding its existing technologies and developing new applications for existing products in close cooperation with its customers

intellectual property

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage

in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor our competitors and vigorously challenge patent and trademark infringement for example chemical products maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent infringement matters in europe asia and the united states we are currently pursuing a number of matters relating to the infringement of our acetic acid patents some of our earlier acetic acid patents will expire in 2007 other patents covering acetic acid are presently pending

as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public our european and us patents for making sunett expired at the end of the first quarter of 2005 thereby reducing our ability to realize revenues from making sunett due to increased competition and potential limitations and possibly causing results of operations and cash flows relating to the product to be less favorable than in the past we believe that the loss of no other single patent which may expire in the next several years will materially adversely affect our business or financial results

we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired we protect our trademarks vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate

environmental and other regulation

obtaining producing and distributing many of our products involves the use storage transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials we are subject to extensive evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and regulations which address among other things the following

      we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances at various sites under some of these laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on under or in its property without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred as many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of our sites and might occur or be discovered at other sites our worldwide expenditures for the year ended december 31 2005 including those with respect to third party and divested sites and those for compliance with environmental control regulations and internal company initiatives totaled 84 million of which 8 million was for capital projects it is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures due to new air regulations in the us management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 35 million to 45 million through 2007 according to our estimates there may be an additional increase of approximately 50 million in addition to the 35 million to 45 million during that time depending on the outcome of the pending court challenge to the low risk alternative method of compliance allowed by recent air regulations for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters but thereafter management believes that the current spending trends will continue it is difficult to estimate the future costs of environmental protection and remediation because of many uncertainties including uncertainties about the status of laws regulations and information related to individual locations and sites subject to the foregoing but taking into consideration our experience to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known we believe that capital expenditures and remedial actions to comply with existing laws governing environmental protection will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

air issues 

in december 1997 the conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change drafted the kyoto protocol which would establish significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential referred to as greenhouse gases and would drive mandatory reductions in developed nations subject to the protocol with russia’s ratification in november 2004 the protocol has been adopted by enough of the larger industrialized countries defined in annex i to the protocol and came into effect in february 2005 in all nations that have ratified it the european union or eu including germany and other countries where the company has interests ratified the kyoto protocol in 2002 and have formulated applicable regulations recent european union regulations required all eu member states to have implemented a trading system covering carbon dioxide emissions by january 1 2005 accordingly an emission trading system came into effect at the start of 2005 the new regulation directly affects our power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites in germany and the lanaken site in belgium as well as the power plants being operated by other infraserv entities on sites at which we operate our power plants and the infraserv entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits which could result in increased operating costs or may be required to develop additional costeffective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further which could result in increased capital expenditures the new regulation also indirectly affects our other operations in the eu which may experience higher energy costs from third party providers however we have determined that the impact of this legislation on future capital spending and operating costs will not be material

in 2002 president bush announced new climate change initiatives for the us among the policies to be pursued is a voluntary commitment to reduce the ‘‘greenhouse gas intensity’’ of the us economy by 18 within the next ten years the bush administration is seeking to partner with various industrial sectors including the chemical industry to reach this goal the american chemistry council of which we are a member has committed to pursue additional reductions in greenhouse gas intensity toward an overall target of 18 by 2012 using 1990 emissions intensity as the baseline we currently emit carbon dioxide and smaller amounts of methane and experience some losses of polyfluorinated hydrocarbons used as refrigerants we have invested and continue to invest in improvements to our processes that increase energy efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas intensity

in some cases compliance with environmental health and safety requirements involves our incurring capital expenditures due to new air regulations in the united states management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 35 million to 45 million through 2007 for example the miscellaneous organic national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulations and various approaches to regulating boilers and incinerators including the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters will impose additional requirements on our operations a significant portion of the neshap for industrialcommercialindustrial boilers and process heaters regulation that provides for a low risk alternative method of compliance for hydrogen chloride emissions has been challenged in federal court we cannot predict the outcome of this challenge which could if successful increase our costs by according to our estimates approximately 50 million in addition to the 35 million to 45 million noted above through 2007 to comply with this regulation

chemical products issues 

other new or revised regulations may place additional requirements on the production handling labeling or use of some chemical products pursuant to a european union regulation on risk assessment of existing chemicals the european chemicals bureau of the european commission has been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals some of the chemicals initially being evaluated include vam which cag produces as well as competitors’ products such as styrene and 13butadiene these risk assessments entail a multistage process to determine whether and to what extent the commission should classify the chemical as a carcinogen and if so whether this classification and related labeling requirements should apply only to finished products that contain specified threshold concentrations of a particular chemical in the case of vam we currently do not expect a final ruling until 2007 we and other vam producers are participating in this process with detailed scientific analyses supporting the industry’s position that vam is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling of end 

products should not be required but that if it is should only be at relatively high parts per million of residual vam levels in the end products it is not possible for us to predict the outcome or effect of any final ruling

several recent studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various medical conditions including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer or iarc recently reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans iarc also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde although it also characterized evidence for such an association as strong the results of iarc’s review will be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde we together with other producers and users are evaluating these findings we cannot predict the final effect of iarc’s reclassification

other recent initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the new european environment and health strategy commonly known as scale and the proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach reach which was proposed by the european commission in october 2003 will establish a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured or imported to the european union depending on the final ruling additional testing documentation and risk assessments will occur for the chemical industry this will affect european producers of chemicals as well as all chemical companies worldwide that export to member states of the european union the final ruling has not yet been decided

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could adversely affect the demand for these products

remediation issues 

we are subject to claims brought by united states federal or state regulatory agencies regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions or private individuals regarding the cleanup of sites that we own or operate owned or operated or where waste or other material from its operations was disposed treated or recycled in particular we have a potential liability under the united states federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended commonly known as superfund the united states resource conservation and recovery act and related state laws or regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions or through obligations retained by contractual agreements for investigation and cleanup costs at many of these sites numerous companies including us or one of our predecessor companies have been notified that the environmental protection agency or epa state governing body or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties under superfund or related laws the proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages the cleanup process has not been completed at most sites we regularly review the liabilities for these sites and accrue our best estimate of our ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs but due to the many variables involved in such estimation the ultimate liability may vary from these estimates

our whollyowned subsidiary infraserv verwaltungs gmbh is the general partner of the infraserv companies that provide onsite general and administrative services at german sites in frankfurt am mainhoechst gendorf huerthknapsack wiesbaden oberhausen and kelsterbach producers at the sites including our subsidiaries are owners of limited partnership interests in the respective infraserv companies the infraserv companies are liable for any residual contamination and other pollution because they own the real estate on which the individual facilities operate in addition hoechst as the 

responsible party under german public law is liable to third parties for all environmental damage that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and real estate however the infraserv companies have agreed to indemnify hoechst from any environmental liability arising out of or in connection with environmental pollution of any infraserv site the partnership agreements provide that as between the limited partners each limited partner is responsible for any contamination caused predominantly by such partner the limited partners have also undertaken to indemnify hoechst against such liabilities any liability that cannot be attributed to an infraserv partner and for which no third party is responsible is required to be borne by the infraserv company in question in view of this potential obligation to eliminate residual contamination the infraserv companies in which we have an interest have recorded provisions totaling approximately 69 million as of december 31 2005 if the infraserv companies default on their respective indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination the limited partners in the infraserv companies have agreed to fund such liabilities subject to a number of limitations to the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the infraserv companies or the limited partners these liabilities are to be borne by us in accordance with the demerger agreement

as between hoechst and cag hoechst has agreed to indemnify cag for twothirds of these demerged residual liabilities likewise in some circumstances cag could be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were not transferred to infraserv companies in which case hoechst must reimburse cag for twothirds of any costs so incurred

some of our facilities in germany are over 100 years old and there may be significant contamination at these facilities provisions are not recorded for potential soil or groundwater contamination liability at facilities still under operation as german law does not currently require owners or operators to investigate and remedy soil or groundwater contamination until the facility is closed and dismantled unless the authorities otherwise direct however soil or groundwater contamination known to the owner or operator must be remedied if such contamination is likely to have an adverse effect on the public if we were to terminate operations at one of our facilities or if german law were changed to require such removal or clean up the cost could be material to us we cannot accurately determine the ultimate potential liability for investigation and clean up at such sites we adjust provisions as new remedial commitments are made see notes 4 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements

export control regulation

from time to time certain of our foreign subsidiaries have made sales of acetate sweeteners and polymer products to customers in countries that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government these countries include cuba iran sudan and syria four countries currently identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and other countries that previously have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states or countries to which sales have been regulated in connection with other foreign policy concerns in september 2005 we began an investigation of these transactions and initially identified approximately 10 million of sales by our foreign subsidiaries that may be in violation of regulations of the united states treasury departments office of foreign assets control or ofac or the united states department of commerces bureau of industry and security we now believe that approximately 5 million of these sales may actually be violations of us law or regulation the potential violations uncovered by the investigation include approximately 180000 of sales of emulsions to cuba by two of our foreign subsidiaries sales to cuba are violations of ofac regulations in addition we have recently discovered that our sales office in turkey sold polymer products to companies in iran and syria including indirectly selling product through other companies located in nonembargoed locations these transactions may have involved an intentional violation of our policies and federal regulations by employees of our office in turkey our investigation of potentially prohibited sales is ongoing and we can not yet be certain of the number of these transactions the sales amounts or the identity of every individual who may have been involved however sales from our office in turkey to all customers are approximately 12 million annually

we have voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us treasury department and the us department of commerce and we are currently engaged in discussions with them we have also taken corrective actions including directives to senior business leaders prohibiting such sales as well as 

modifications to our accounting systems that are intended to prevent the initiation of sales to countries that are subject to the us treasury department or the us department of commerce restrictions

if violations of the us export control laws are found we could be subject to civil penalties of up to 50000 per violation and criminal penalties could range up to the greater of 1 million per violation or five times the value of the goods sold if such violations occurred the united states government could deny us export privileges the ultimate resolution of this matter is subject to completion of our investigation and a final ruling or settlement with the government accordingly we cannot estimate the potential sanctions or fines relating to this matter there can be no assurance that any governmental investigation or our own investigation of these matters will not conclude that violations of applicable laws have occurred or that the results of these investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see ‘‘risk factors—risks related to our business—we are an international company and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations’’

organizational structure

significant subsidiaries 

we operate our global businesses through subsidiaries in europe north america and asia all of which are owned indirectly through a series of holding companies our european and asian subsidiaries including celanese chemicals europe gmbh ticona gmbh nutrinova nutrition specialties  food ingredients gmbh and celanese singapore pte ltd are owned indirectly by cag in north america many of the businesses are consolidated under cac which through its whollyowned subsidiary cna holdings inc directly or indirectly owns the north american operating companies these include celanese ltd ticona polymers inc celanese acetate llc and grupo celanese sa

employees

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 9300 employees worldwide from continuing operations compared to 9100 as of december 31 2004 this represents an increase of approximately 15 the following table sets forth the approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of december 31 2005 2004 and 2003

 

many of our employees are unionized particularly in germany canada mexico brazil belgium and france however in the united states less than one quarter of our employees are unionized moreover in germany and france wages and general working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements within the limits established by these agreements our various subsidiaries negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations such as workers’ councils representing the employees collective bargaining agreements between the german chemical employers associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have a term of one year while in the united states a three year term for collective bargaining agreements is typical we offer comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory




 item 1a risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on celanese’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the principal factors are described below 

risks related to our business

we are an international company and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations

we operate in the global market and have customers in many countries we have major facilities located in north america europe and asia including facilities in germany china japan korea and saudi arabia operated through ventures our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions

conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increased security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of united states german or european union governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including our stock

from time to time certain of our foreign subsidiaries have made sales of acetate sweeteners and polymer products to customers in countries that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government these countries include cuba iran sudan and syria four countries currently identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and other countries that previously have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states or countries to which sales have been regulated in connection with other foreign policy concerns in september 2005 we began an investigation of these transactions and initially identified approximately 10 million of sales by our foreign subsidiaries that may be in violation of regulations of the united states treasury departments office of foreign assets control or ofac or the united states department of commerces bureau of industry and security we now believe that approximately 5 million of these sales may actually be violations of us law or regulation the potential violations uncovered by the investigation include approximately 180000 of sales of emulsions to cuba by two of our foreign subsidiaries sales to cuba are violations of ofac regulations in addition we have recently discovered that our sales office in turkey sold polymer products to companies in iran and syria including indirectly selling product through other companies located in nonembargoed locations these transactions may have involved an intentional violation of our policies and federal regulations by employees of our office in turkey our investigation of potentially prohibited sales is ongoing and we can not yet be certain of the number of these transactions the sales amounts or the identity of every individual who may have been involved however sales from our office in turkey to all customers are approximately 12 million annually

we have voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us treasury department and the us department of commerce and we are currently engaged in discussions with them we have also taken corrective actions including directives to senior business leaders prohibiting such sales as well as modifications to our accounting systems that are intended to prevent the initiation of sales to countries that are subject to the us treasury department or the us department of commerce restrictions

if violations of the us export control laws are found we could be subject to civil penalties of up to 50000 per violation and criminal penalties could range up to the greater of 1 million per violation or five times the value of the goods sold if such violations occurred the united states government could 

deny us export privileges the ultimate resolution of this matter is subject to completion of our investigation and a final ruling or settlement with the government accordingly we cannot estimate the potential sanctions or fines relating to this matter there can be no assurance that any governmental investigation or our own investigation of these matters will not conclude that violations of applicable laws have occurred or that the results of these investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

cyclicality in the industrial chemicals industry has in the past and may in the future result in reduced operating margins or in operating losses

consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in particular those in acetyl products such as methanol formaldehyde acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer has increased significantly over the past 30 years despite this growth in consumption producers have experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and excess capacity for these products periods of inadequate capacity including some due to raw material shortages have usually resulted in increased selling prices and operating margins this has often been followed by periods of capacity additions which have resulted in declining capacity utilization rates selling prices and operating margins

we expect that these cyclical trends in selling prices and operating margins relating to capacity shortfalls and additions will likely persist in the future principally due to the continuing combined impact of five factors

     the length and depth of product and industry business cycles of our markets particularly in the automotive electrical construction and textile industries may result in reduced operating margins or in operating losses

some of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in raw materials prices and the availability of key raw materials

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene butane methanol and propylene from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the chemical products segment principally formaldehyde acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer as well as oxo products we use a portion of our output of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our segments we also purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the acetate products segment we purchase significant amounts of natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil to supply the energy required in our production processes

we also lease supplies of various precious metals such as rhodium used as catalysts for the production of these chemicals with growing demand for these precious metals most notably in the automotive industry the cost to purchase or lease these precious metals has increased caused by a shortage in supply these circumstances are expected to continue into the second half of 2006

prices of natural gas oil and other hydrocarbons and energy increased dramatically in 2005 and 2004 to the extent this trend continues and we are unable to pass through these price increases to our customers our operating profit and results of operations may be less favorable than expected

we are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene propylene wood pulp electricity coal and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include

    we strive to improve profit margins of many of our products through price increases when warranted and accepted by the market however our operating margins may decrease if we cannot pass on increased raw material prices to customers even in periods during which raw material prices decline we may suffer decreasing operating profit margins if raw material price reductions occur at a slower rate than decreases in the selling prices of our products

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change we manage our exposure through the use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging entering into longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements our policy for the majority of our natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2005 and 2004 there were no derivative contracts of this type outstanding in 2003 there were forward contracts covering approximately 35 of our chemical products north american requirements we regularly assess our practice of purchasing a portion of our commodity requirements forward and the utilization of a variety of other raw material hedging instruments in addition to forward purchase contracts in accordance with changes in market conditions

we capped our exposure on approximately 20 of our us natural gas requirements during the months of august and september of 2004 the fixed price natural gas forward contracts and any premium associated with the purchase of a price cap are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap or cap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing or limiting predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts were structured to limit exposure to increases in commodity prices certain swaps may also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap or cap contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges

we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide and acetaldehyde we may not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials due to unforeseen developments that would cause an interruption in supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material these sources may not make up for the loss of a major supplier nor can there be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of a sole or a major supplier

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position

our operating results especially in our performance products and ticona segments depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades and applications 

as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results will be negatively affected likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized

frankfurt airport expansion could require us to reduce production capacity of limit expansion potential of or incur relocation costs for our kelsterbach plant which would lead to significant additional costs

the frankfurt airport’s expansion plans include the construction of an additional runway the northwest option which would be located in close proximity to our kelsterbach production plant the construction of this particular runway could have a negative effect on the plant’s current production capacity and future development while the government of the state of hesse and the owner of the frankfurt airport promote the expansion of the northwest option it is uncertain whether this option is in accordance with applicable laws although the government of the state of hesse expects the plan approval for the airport expansion in 2007 and the start of operations in 20092010 neither the final outcome of this matter nor its timing can be predicted at this time

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws concerning and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these include obligations related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between cag and hoechst also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger see ‘‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—environmental liabilities’’ notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate them we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present consequently compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities and our business and operating results may be less favorable than expected due to new air regulations in the us management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 35 million to 45 million through 2007 for example the miscellaneous organic national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap regulations and various approaches to regulating boilers and incinerators including the neshaps for industrial commercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters will impose additional requirements on our operations although some of these rules have been finalized a significant portion of the neshaps for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters regulation that provides for a low risk alternative method of compliance for hydrogen chloride emissions has been challenged in federal court we cannot predict the outcome of this challenge which could if successful increase our costs by according to our estimates approximately 50 million in addition to the 35 million to 45 million noted above through 2007 to comply with this regulation

we are also involved in several claims lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters an adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period

changes in environmental health and safety regulatory requirements could lead to a decrease in demand for our products

new or revised governmental regulations relating to health safety and the environment may also affect demand for our products

pursuant to the european union regulation on risk assessment of existing chemicals the european chemicals bureau of the european commission has been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals some of the chemicals initially being evaluated include vam which we produce these risk assessments entail a multistage process to determine to what extent the european commission should classify the chemical as a carcinogen and if so whether this classification and related labeling requirements should apply only to finished products that contain specified threshold concentrations of a particular chemical in the case of vam we currently do not expect a final ruling until the end of 2007 we and other vam producers are participating in this process with detailed scientific analyses supporting the industry’s position that vam is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling of final products should not be required if labeling is required then it should depend on relatively high parts per million of residual vam in these end products we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any final ruling

several recent studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer or iarc recently reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans iarc also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde although it also characterized evidence for such an association as strong the results of iarc’s review will be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde we are participating together with other producers and users in the evaluations of these findings we cannot predict the final effect of iarc’s reclassification

other recent initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary children’s chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the new european environment and health strategy commonly known as scale as well as the proposal for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach reach which the european commission proposed in october 2003 will establish a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured in or imported to the european union depending on the final ruling additional testing documentation and risk assessments will occur for the chemical industry this will affect european producers of chemicals as well as all chemical companies worldwide that export to member states of the european union the final ruling has not yet been decided

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these hazards include among other things

  31

 these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance which we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices but we cannot predict whether this insurance will be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to our business we have established two captive insurance subsidiaries ‘‘captives’’ that provide a portion of the total insurance coverage to us for certain of our lower tier property and casualty risks they additionally provide coverage to third parties for their higher tier risk programs if there were concurrent claims made on all policies issued by the captives sufficient capital may not be available for them to satisfy all claims against all such policies

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our profitability

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates

as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may affect

  we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the net notional amounts under such foreign currency contracts outstanding at december 31 2005 were 564 million

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar at a constant level of business our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary’s functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction andor translation risks effectively or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost

our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost for subsequent fiscal years

cag may be required to make payments to hoechst

under its 1999 demerger agreement with hoechst cag agreed to indemnify hoechst for environmental liabilities that hoechst may incur with respect to cag’s german production sites which were transferred from hoechst to cag in connection with the demerger cag also has an obligation to indemnify hoechst against liabilities for environmental damages or contamination arising under certain divestiture agreements entered into by hoechst prior to the demerger as the indemnification obligations depend on the occurrence of unpredictable future events the costs associated with them are not yet determinable and may materially affect operating results

cag’s obligation to indemnify hoechst against liabilities for environmental contamination in connection with the divestiture agreements is subject to the following thresholds translated into us dollars using the december 31 2005 exchange rate

   cag has made total cumulative payments through december 31 2005 of 41 million for environmental contamination liabilities in connection with the divestiture agreements and may be required to make additional payments in the future as of december 31 2005 we have reserves of approximately 33 million for this contingency and may be required to record additional reserves in the future

also cag has undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify hoechst to the extent that hoechst is required to discharge liabilities including tax liabilities in relation to assets included in the demerger where such liabilities have not been demerged due to transfer or other restrictions cag did not make any payments to hoechst during the year ended december 31 2005 nor did it make any payments in 2004 or 2003 in connection with this indemnity

under the demerger agreement cag will also be responsible directly or indirectly for all of hoechst’s obligations to past employees of businesses that were demerged to cag under the demerger agreement hoechst agreed to indemnify cag from liabilities other than liabilities for environmental contamination stemming from the agreements governing the divestiture of hoechst’s polyester businesses which were demerged to cag insofar as such liabilities relate to the european part of that business hoechst has also agreed to bear 80 of the financial obligations arising in connection with the government investigation and litigation associated with the sorbates industry for price fixing described in ‘‘legal proceedings—sorbates antitrust actions’’ and note 25 to the consolidated financial statements and cag has agreed to bear the remaining 20

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase which we expect to occur our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 19 billion of variable rate debt of which 03 billion is hedged with an interest rate swap which leaves us approximately 16 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate exposure accordingly a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 16 million

we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our debt portfolio we have in the past used swaps for hedging purposes only

we are a ‘‘controlled company’’ within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements

affiliates of the sponsor continue to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a ‘‘controlled company’’ within the meaning of the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards under the new york stock exchange rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by another company is a ‘‘controlled company’’ and need not comply with certain requirements including 1 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 the requirement that the nominating committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 3 the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 4 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees we intend to utilize these exemptions as a result we will not have a majority of independent directors nor will our nominating and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors accordingly you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

because our sponsor controls us the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited and conflicts of interest between our sponsor and us or you could arise in the future

our sponsor beneficially owns or has a right to acquire approximately 521 of our outstanding series a common stock under the terms of the stockholders’ agreement between us and the original shareholders certain of the original stockholders that are affiliates of the sponsor are also entitled to designate all nominees for election to our board of directors for so long as they hold at least 25 of the total voting power of our series a common stock thereafter although our sponsor will not have an explicit contractual right to do so it may still nominate directors in its capacity as a stockholder as a result our sponsor through its control over the composition of our board of directors and its control of the majority of the voting power of our series a common stock will continue to have effective control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of equityholders regardless of whether or not other equityholders believe that any such transaction is in their own best interests for example our sponsor effectively could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or to sell revenuegenerating assets additionally our sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us our sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant amount of our equity even if such amount is less than 50 it will continue to be able to significantly influence or effectively control our decisions

our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy that we have in or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in specified business opportunities the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that none of the original stockholders including the sponsor or their affiliates or any director who is not employed by celanese including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from i engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or our affiliates now engage or propose to engage or ii otherwise competing with us in addition in the event that any of the original stockholders including the sponsor or any nonemployee director acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for itself or himself or its or his affiliates and for celanese or its affiliates such original stockholder or nonemployee director has no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us and may take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another person or entity

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our margins

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce

as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public our european and us patents for making sunett an important performance products product expired at the end of the first quarter of 2005 which reduces our ability to realize revenues from making sunett due to increased competition and potential limitations and will result in our results of operations and cash flows relating to the product being less favorable than today

we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired if we are not successful in protecting our trademark rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected

the market price of our series a common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of the series a common stock in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our series a common stock could decrease significantly

provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any shareholders’ rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt

provisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term or as a result of any shareholders’ rights plan that our board of directors may adopt in addition we would be required to issue additional shares of our series a common stock to holders of the preferred stock who convert following a fundamental change these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our series a common stock

risks related to the acquisition of cag

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative the company’s managerial control over celanese ag is limited

we own 100 of the outstanding shares of cac and approximately 98 of the outstanding shares of cag our access to the cash flows and our control of cag is subject to the continuing effectiveness of the domination agreement

the domination agreement is subject to legal challenges instituted by dissenting shareholders minority shareholders have filed several actions against cag in the frankfurt district court  landgericht  including actions that seek to set aside the shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on july 30 and 31 2004 although a number of these lawsuits were settled in march 2006 if any of the remaining lawsuits are successful the domination agreement and the change in cag’s fiscal year could be declared void and cag could be prohibited from performing its obligations under the domination agreement in addition public register proceedings instituted by two minority shareholders are pending in the königstein local court  amtsgericht  these proceedings were commenced with a view to have the registration of the domination agreement in the commercial register deleted  amtslöschungsverfahren  see ‘‘legal proceedings’’

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative the purchaser’s ability and thus our ability to control the board of management decisions of cag will be significantly limited by german law as a result we may not be able to ensure that our strategy for the operation of our business can be fully implemented in addition our access to the operating cash flow of cag in order to fund payment requirements on our indebtedness will be limited which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative certain actions taken under the domination agreement might have to be reversed

if the legal challenges to the domination agreement by dissenting shareholders of cag are successful some or all actions taken under the domination agreement may be required to be reversed and the purchaser may be required to compensate cag for damages caused by such actions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and on the value of our stock

minority shareholders may interfere with cag’s future actions which may prevent us from causing cag to take actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

the purchaser currently owns approximately 98 of the cag shares shareholders unrelated to us hold the remainder of the outstanding cag shares german law provides certain rights to minority shareholders which could have the effect of delaying or interfering with corporate actions including those requiring shareholder approval such as a squeezeout in accordance with the provisions of the german transformation act  umwandlungsgesetz umwg  minority shareholders may be able to delay or prevent the implementation of cag’s corporate actions irrespective of the size of their shareholding any challenge by minority shareholders to the validity of a corporate action may be subject to judicial resolution that may substantially delay or hinder the implementation of such action such delays of or interferences with corporate actions as well as related litigation may limit our access to cag’s cash flows and make it difficult or impossible for us to take or implement corporate actions which may be desirable in view of our operating or financial requirements including actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

cag’s board of management may refuse to comply with instructions given by the purchaser pursuant to the domination agreement which may prevent us from causing cag to take actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

under the domination agreement the purchaser is entitled to give instructions directly to the board of management of cag including but not limited to instructions that are disadvantageous to cag as long as such disadvantageous instructions benefit the purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the purchaser or cag cag’s board of management is required to comply with any such instruction unless at the time when such instruction is given i it is in the opinion of the board of management of cag obviously not in the interests of the purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the purchaser or cag ii in the event of a disadvantageous instruction the negative consequences to cag are disproportionate to the benefits to the purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the purchaser or cag iii compliance with the instruction would violate legal or statutory restrictions iv compliance with the instruction would endanger the existence of cag or v it is doubtful whether the purchaser will be able to fully compensate cag as required by the domination agreement for its annual loss 

 jahresfehlbetrag  incurred during the fiscal year in which such instruction is given the board of management of cag remains ultimately responsible for making the executive decisions for cag and the purchaser despite the domination agreement is not entitled to act on behalf of and has no power to legally bind cag the cag board of management may delay the implementation of or refuse to implement any of the purchaser’s instructions despite its general obligation to follow such instructions with the exceptions mentioned above such delays of or interferences with compliance with the purchaser’s instructions by the board of management of cag may make it difficult or impossible for the purchaser to implement corporate actions which may be desirable in view of our operating or financial requirements including actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

the purchaser is required to ensure that cag pays a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the minority shareholders of cag which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us

as long as the purchaser does not own 100 of the outstanding cag shares the domination agreement requires among other things the purchaser to ensure that cag makes a gross guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  to minority shareholders of €327 per cag share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any future dividend taking into account the circumstances and the tax rates at the time of entering into of the domination agreement the net guaranteed fixed annual payment is €289 per cag share for a full fiscal year as of december 31 2005 there were approximately 09 million cag shares held by minority shareholders the net guaranteed fixed annual payment may depending on applicable corporate tax rates in the future be higher lower or the same as €289 the amount of this guaranteed fixed annual payment was calculated in accordance with applicable german law the amount of the payment is currently under review in special award proceedings  spruchverfahren  see ‘‘legal proceedings’’ such guaranteed fixed annual payments will be required regardless of whether the actual distributable profits per share of cag are higher equal to or lower than the amount of the guaranteed fixed annual payment per share the guaranteed fixed annual payment will be payable for so long as there are minority shareholders of cag and the domination agreement remains in place no dividends for the period after the effectiveness of the domination agreement other than the guaranteed fixed annual payment effectively paid by the purchaser have been or are expected to be paid by cag these requirements may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to the company and its subsidiaries and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our respective indebtedness see ‘‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity—domination agreement’’

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment offered under the domination agreement may be increased which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us

several minority shareholders of cag have initiated special award proceedings  spruchverfahren  seeking the court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  offered under the domination agreement on march 14 2005 the frankfurt district court  landgericht  dismissed on grounds of inadmissibility the motions of all minority shareholders regarding the initiation of these special award proceedings in january 2006 the frankfurt higher district court  oberlandesgericht  ruled that the appeals were admissible and the proceedings will therefore continue as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  could be increased by the court and the purchaser would be required to make such payments within two months after the publication of the court’s ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders including those who have already received the fair cash compensation would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to the company and its subsidiaries and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see ‘‘legal proceedings’’

the purchaser may be required to compensate cag for annual losses which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to celanese

under the domination agreement the purchaser is required among other things to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred determined in accordance with german accounting requirements by 

cag at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred this obligation to compensate cag for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the domination agreement if cag incurs losses during any period of the operative term of the domination agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of cag at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to cag to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves  gewinnrücklagen  accrued at the level of cag during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to cag by offsetting against such loss compensation claims by cag any valuable counterclaims against cag that the purchaser may have if the purchaser is obligated to make cash payments to cag to cover an annual loss we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of cag the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall see ‘‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity —domination agreement’’

we and two of our subsidiaries have taken on certain obligations with respect to the purchaser’s obligation under the domination agreement and intercompany indebtedness to cag which may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness

our subsidiaries celanese caylux and bcp crystal have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing so that the purchaser is at all times in a position to completely meet its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement they have further guaranteed to all minority shareholders of cag that the purchaser will meet the obligations to make a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the outstanding minority shareholders and to offer to acquire all outstanding cag shares from the minority shareholders in return for payment of fair cash consideration in addition celanese has guaranteed i that the purchaser will meet its obligation under the domination agreement to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred by cag during the term of the domination agreement and ii the repayment of all existing intercompany indebtedness of celanese’s subsidiaries to cag further under the terms of celanese’s guarantee in certain limited circumstances cag may be entitled to require the immediate repayment of some or all of the intercompany indebtedness owed by celanese’s subsidiaries to cag if celanese celanese caylux andor bcp crystal are obligated to make payments under their obligations to the purchaser or cag as the case may be or if the intercompany indebtedness owed to cag is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due or other expenditures

even if the minority shareholders’ challenges to the domination agreement are unsuccessful and the domination agreement continues to be operative we may not be able to receive distributions from cag sufficient to pay our obligations

even if the minority shareholders’ challenges to the domination agreement are unsuccessful and the domination agreement continues to be operative we are limited in the amount of distributions we may receive in any year from cag under german law the amount of distributions to the purchaser will be determined based on the amount of unappropriated earnings generated during the term of the domination agreement as shown in the unconsolidated annual financial statements of cag prepared in accordance with german accounting principles and as adopted and approved by resolutions of the cag board of management and supervisory board which financial statements may be different from celanese’s consolidated financial statements under us gaap our share of these earnings if any may not be sufficient to allow us to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock

we must rely on payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our preferred stock and certain of our subsidiaries must rely on payments from their own subsidiaries to fund payments on their indebtedness such funds may not be available in certain circumstances

we must rely on payments from our subsidiaries to fund dividend redemption and other payments on our preferred stock in addition our subsidiaries crystal us holdings 3 llc ‘‘crystal llc’’ and bcp crystal are holding companies and all of their operations are conducted through their subsidiaries therefore they depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries including cag to meet their obligations 

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative such subsidiaries may be unable to meet their obligations under such indebtedness although the domination agreement became operative on october 1 2004 it is subject to legal challenges instituted by dissenting shareholders see legal proceedings

the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us bcp crystal and crystal llc by way of dividends interest return on investments or other payments including loans or distributions is subject to various restrictions including restrictions imposed by the amended and restated senior credit facilities and indentures governing their indebtedness and the terms of future debt may also limit or prohibit such payments in addition the ability of the subsidiaries to make such payments may be limited by relevant provisions of german and other applicable laws

the purchaser may be required to purchase all of the remaining outstanding cag shares at a price yet to be determined

the purchaser currently owns approximately 98 of cag’s shares in november 2005 we requested the purchaser to require as permitted under german law the transfer of the cag shares owned by the thenoutstanding minority shareholders of cag in exchange for fair cash compensation the ‘‘squeezeout’’ a squeezeout is permitted under german law once a shareholder acquires 95 or more of cag’s registered ordinary share capital excluding treasury shares a shareholders’ resolution authorizing the squeezeout is scheduled to be brought before the annual general meeting in may 2006 the amount of the fair cash compensation per share under the squeezeout has been set to €6222 per share this price might even be increased if the amount of fair cash compensation is challenged in court see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — basis of presentation — squeezeout

risks related to internal controls

our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation

we are evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec thereunder which we refer to as section 404 we are currently performing the system and process evaluation and testing required and any necessary remediation in an effort to comply with management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 will initially apply to us as of december 31 2006 and cag as of september 30 2007 in the course of our ongoing section 404 evaluation we have identified areas of internal controls that may need improvement and are implementing enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues that might be identified through this review however as we are still in the evaluation process we may identify conditions that may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future in 2004 certain members of our accounting staff identified two significant deficiencies in 2005 we identified a significant deficiency initiated from an sec review of a registration statement filed in the third quarter of 2005 two material weaknesses in addition to and separate from our section 404 evaluation process were also identified in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended december 31 2004 those deficiencies are discussed in detail in the immediately subsequent risk factor

we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance our internal controls would be considered ineffective for purposes of section 404 our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec as a result there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in addition we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel any such action could negatively affect our results

we and our independent auditors have identified significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls that could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports

in addition to and separate from our evaluation of internal controls under section 404 and any areas requiring improvement that we identify as part of that process we previously identified two significant deficiencies and two material weaknesses in our internal controls the public company accounting oversight board ‘‘pcaob’’ defines a significant deficiency as a control deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects our ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected the pcaob defines a material weakness as a single deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected

in 2004 we identified two significant deficiencies in internal controls in the computation of certain accounting adjustments these deficiencies were discovered in addition to and separate from the evaluation process we are conducting in connection with section 404 the first deficiency was identified during the quarter ended june 30 2004 by members of our corporate financial reporting group and related to the qualifications and ability of certain accounting managers to initially calculate the change from the lifo lastin firstout method of accounting for inventories to fifo firstin firstout and the resulting failure of such employees to correctly make such calculations the second was identified during the quarter ended june 30 2004 by one of our financial accounting managers and related to an omitted employee benefit accrual due to the failure to provide the applicable employment contracts to the actuary prior to the cutoff date for the december 31 2003 pension valuation corrective actions taken by us included an internal audit review the development of enhanced guidelines the termination and reassignment of responsible persons and an elevation of the issues to the supervisory board of cag the significant deficiencies noted were corrected in the quarter ended september 30 2004 and thus did not exist as of december 31 2004 and 2005

in september 2005 we identified a significant deficiency in internal controls relating to sales to countries and other parties that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the u s government this significant deficiency was identified as a result of an internal investigation that was initiated in connection with the sec review of a registration statement filed in the third quarter of 2005 the company has informed the us treasury department and the us department of commerce of these matters and is currently engaged in discussions with the departments to the extent that the company violated any regulations with respect to the above or other transactions the company may be subject to fines or other sanctions including possible criminal penalties which may result in adverse business consequences we have taken immediate corrective actions which include a directive to senior business leaders stating that they are prohibited from selling products into certain countries subject to these trade restrictions as well as making accounting systems modifications that prevents the initiation of purchase orders and shipment of products to these countries also we plan to enhance the business conduct policy training in the area of export control as a result we believe that we have taken remediation measures that once fully implemented will be effective in eliminating this deficiency

in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended december 31 2004 we identified a material weakness in our internal controls for the same period on march 30 2005 we received a letter from kpmg llp kpmg our independent auditors who also identified the same material weakness and a second material weakness in the course of their audit the additional material weakness identified by kpmg related to several deficiencies in the assessment of hedge effectiveness and documentation the required adjustments were made in the proper accounting period except for one immaterial hedging transaction adjusted during the quarter ended june 30 2005 the material weakness identified by kpmg and us related to conditions preventing our ability to adequately research document review and draw conclusions on accounting and reporting matters which had previously resulted in adjustments that had to be recorded to prevent a material misstatement of our financial statements the conditions largely related to significant increases in the frequency of and the limited number of personnel available to address complex accounting matters and transactions and as a result of the consummation of simultaneous debt and equity offerings during the yearend closing process 

we do not believe that the adjustments made in connection with these material weaknesses had any material impact on previously reported financial information in response to the letter from kpmg with respect to the first material weakness identified above we organized a team responsible for the identification and documentation of potential derivative accounting transactions and commenced and completed formal training for team members specifically related to derivative accounting with respect to the second material weakness identified above we hired additional qualified accounting personnel which should ensure that we will be able to adequately research document review and draw conclusions on accounting and reporting matters both material weaknesses were identified during our december 31 2004 yearend closing process and we believe that we have remediated these material weaknesses as of december 31 2005

during 2005 we have been implementing changes to strengthen our internal controls as a result of these changes we believe that as of december 31 2005 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective for gathering and analyzing and disclosing on a timely basis the information required to be disclosed under the rules and forms of the sec while we have taken actions to address these deficiencies and weaknesses additional measures may be necessary and these measures along with other measures we expect to take to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified by us or ensure that our internal controls are effective if we are unable to correct existing or future deficiencies or weaknesses in internal controls in a timely manner our ability to record process summarize and report financial information within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec will be adversely affected this failure could materially and adversely impact our business our financial condition and the market value of our securities in addition there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in reliability of future financial statements and sec filings

risks related to our indebtedness

our high level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness

we are highly leveraged our total indebtedness totals approximately 34 billion as of december 31 2005 excluding 175 million of future accretion on the senior discount notes

our substantial debt could have important consequences including

      despite our current high leverage we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks of our high leverage

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so if new debt including amounts available under our senior credit facilities is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify see 

‘‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—liquidity—contractual obligations’’

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand receipt of additional capital including possible additional borrowings and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of distributions advances or cash payments see ‘‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—liquidity—contractual obligations’’

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the amended and restated senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness

the amended and restated senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of crystal llc bcp crystal and their restricted subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase their capital stock or make other restricted payments make investments and sell certain assets

in addition the amended and restated senior credit facilities contain covenants that require celanese holdings to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests celanese holdings’ ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control and it may not be able to meet those tests at all a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the amended and restated senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under the amended and restated senior credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the amended and restated senior credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if celanese holdings were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the amended and restated senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness celanese’s subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of their assets as collateral under the amended and restated senior credit facilities if the lenders under the amended and restated senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company and its subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay the amended and restated senior credit facilities as well as their other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock

the terms of our amended and restated senior credit facilities limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries however the terms of our amended 

and restated senior credit facilities limit the ability of bcp crystal and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer their assets to us accordingly our ability to pay dividends on our stock is similarly limited

we believe that our current facilities and those of our consolidated subsidiaries are adequate to meet the requirements of our present and foreseeable future operations we continue to review our capacity requirements as part of our strategy to maximize our global manufacturing efficiency

for information on environmental issues associated with our properties see ‘‘business—environmental and other regulation’’ and ‘‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—environmental matters’’ additional information with respect to our property plant and equipment and leases is contained in notes 11 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to such matters as product liability antitrust past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment while it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings lawsuits and claims management believes based on the advice of legal counsel that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see also note 25 to the consolidated financial statements

plumbing actions 

cna holdings inc ‘‘cna holdings’’ a us subsidiary of celanese corporation which included the us business now conducted by the ticona segment along with shell oil company ‘‘shell’’ dupont and others has been a defendant in a series of lawsuits including a number of class actions alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail based on among other things the findings of outside experts and the successful use of ticona’s acetyl copolymer in similar applications cna holdings does not believe ticona’s acetyl copolymer was defective or caused the plumbing systems to fail in many cases cna holdings’ exposure may be limited by invocation of the statute of limitations since cna holdings ceased selling the resin for use in the plumbing systems in site built homes during 1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990

cna holdings has been named a defendant in ten putative class actions further described below as well as a defendant in other nonclass actions filed in ten states the us virgin islands and canada in these actions the plaintiffs typically have sought recovery for alleged property damages and in some cases additional damages under the texas deceptive trade practices act or similar type statutes damage amounts have not been specified

developments under these matters are as follows

    47

  in order to reduce litigation expenses and to provide relief to qualifying homeowners in november 1995 cna holdings dupont and shell entered into national class action settlements which have been approved by the courts the settlements call for the replacement of plumbing systems of claimants who have had qualifying leaks as well as reimbursements for certain leak damage furthermore the three companies have agreed to fund these replacements and reimbursements up to 950 million as of december 31 2005 the aggregate funding is 1073 million due to additional contributions and funding commitments made primarily by other parties there are additional pending lawsuits in approximately ten jurisdictions not covered by this settlement however these cases do not involve either individually or in the aggregate a large number of homes and management does not expect the obligations arising from these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on the company

in 1995 cna holdings and shell oil company settled the claims relating to individuals in texas owning a total of 110000 property units who are represented by a texas law firm for an amount that will not exceed 170 million these claimants are also eligible for a replumb of their homes in accordance with terms similar to those of the national class action settlement cna holdings’ and shells contributions under this settlement were subject to allocation as determined by binding arbitration

in addition a lawsuit filed in november 1989 in delaware chancery court between cna holdings and various of its insurance companies relating to all claims incurred and to be incurred for the product liability exposure led to a partial declaratory judgment in cna holdings’ favor as a result settlements have been reached with a majority of cna holdings’ insurers specifying their responsibility for these claims in february 2005 cna holdings reached a settlement agreement through mediation with another insurer pursuant to which the insurer agreed to pay cna holdings 44 million in exchange for the release of certain claims against the policy with the insurer this amount was recorded as a reduction of goodwill as of december 31 2004 and was received during the year ended december 31 2005

management believes that the plumbing actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements and that they will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position however if we were to incur an additional charge for this matter such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period no assurance can be given that our litigation reserves will be adequate or that we will fully recover claims under our insurance policies

sorbates antitrust actions

in may 2002 the european commission informed hoechst of its intent to investigate officially the sorbates industry in early january 2003 the european commission served hoechst nutrinova and a number of competitors with a statement of objections alleging unlawful anticompetitive behavior affecting the european sorbates market in october 2003 the european commission ruled that hoechst chisso corporation daicel the nippon synthetic chemical industry co ltd and ueno fine chemicals industry ltd operated a cartel in the european sorbates market between 1979 and 1996 the european commission imposed a total fine of €1384 million approximately 189 million of which €99 million approximately 135 million was assessed against hoechst the case against nutrinova was closed the 

fine against hoechst is based on the european commission’s finding that hoechst does not qualify under the leniency policy is a repeat violator and together with daicel was a coconspirator in hoechst’s favor the european commission gave a discount for cooperating in the investigation hoechst appealed the european commission’s decision in december 2003 and that appeal is still pending

in addition several civil antitrust actions by sorbates customers seeking monetary damages and other relief for alleged conduct involving the sorbates industry have been filed in us state and federal courts naming hoechst nutrinova and our other subsidiaries as well as other sorbates manufacturers as defendants many of these actions have been settled and dismissed by the court one private action kerr v eastman chemical co et al  previously pending in the superior court of new jersey law division gloucester county was dismissed for failure to prosecute the plaintiff alleged violations of the new jersey antitrust act and the new jersey consumer fraud act and sought unspecified damages the only other private action that had still been pending freeman v daicel  was dismissed the plaintiffs lost their appeal to the supreme court of tennessee in august 2005 and have since filed a motion for leave

in july 2001 hoechst and nutrinova entered into an agreement with the attorneys general of 33 states pursuant to which the statutes of limitations were tolled pending the states’ investigations this agreement expired in july 2003 since october 2002 the attorneys general for several states filed suit on behalf of indirect purchasers in their respective states all of which have been either settled or dismissed except as noted below the nevada action has been dismissed as to hoechst nutrinova and cag and a motion for reconsideration was denied the new york action new york v daicel chemical industries ltd et al  which was pending in the new york state supreme court new york county was dismissed in august 2005 however appeals are pending

in january 2005 hoechst nutrinova and other subsidiaries as well as other sorbates manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of connecticut florida hawaii maryland south carolina oregon and washington before those states filed suit pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement the defendants agreed to refrain from engaging in anticompetitive conduct with respect to the sale or distribution of sorbates and to pay an immaterial amount to the states in satisfaction of all released claims

based upon the information as available the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty

the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  offered under the domination agreement may be increased in special award proceedings  spruchverfahren  initiated by minority shareholders which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us as of the date of this annual report several minority shareholders of cag had initiated special award proceedings seeking court’s review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  offered under the domination agreement as a result of these proceedings the amount of the fair cash consideration and the guaranteed fixed annual payment offered under the domination agreement could be increased by the court so that all minority shareholders including those who have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer and have received the fair cash compensation could claim the respective higher amounts the court dismissed all of these proceedings in march 2005 on the grounds of inadmissibility thirtythree plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and in january 2006 twentythree of these appeals were granted by the court they were remanded back to the court of first instance where the valuation will be further reviewed

our board of directors may at any time modify or revoke our dividend policy on our series a common stock

we are required under the terms of the preferred stock to pay scheduled quarterly dividends subject to legally available funds for so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding 1 we will not declare pay or set apart funds for the payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to any junior stock or parity stock and 2 neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will subject to certain exceptions redeem purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration junior stock or parity stock through a sinking fund or otherwise in each case unless we have paid or set apart funds for the payment of all accumulated and unpaid dividends with respect to the shares of preferred stock and any parity stock for all preceding dividend periods pursuant to this policy the company paid the quarterly dividends of 0265625 on its 425 convertible perpetual preferred stock on august 1 2005 november 1 2005 and february 1 2006 the anticipated annual cash dividend is approximately 10 million

in this annual report on form 10k the term ‘‘celanese’’ refers to celanese corporation a delaware corporation and not its subsidiaries the terms the ‘‘company’’ ‘‘we’’ ‘‘our’’ ‘‘us’’ and successor refer to celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the term ‘‘bcp crystal’’ refers to our subsidiary bcp crystal us holdings corp a delaware corporation and not its subsidiaries the term ‘‘purchaser’’ refers to our subsidiary celanese europe holding gmbh  co kg formerly known as bcp crystal acquisition gmbh  co kg a german limited partnership kommanditgesellschaft kg and not its subsidiaries except where otherwise indicated the term ‘‘original shareholders’’ refers collectively to blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 1 blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 2 blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 3 and ba capital investors sidecar fund lp the terms ‘‘sponsor’’ and ‘‘advisor’’ refer to certain affiliates of the blackstone group 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and the results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements which were prepared in accordance with us gaap 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers periods prior and subsequent to the acquisition of cag and its subsidiaries collectively ‘‘cag’’ or the ‘‘predecessor’’ accordingly the discussion and analysis of historical periods prior to the acquisition do not reflect the significant impact that the acquisition of cag has had and will have on the successor including increased leverage and liquidity requirements as well as purchase accounting adjustments furthermore the successor and the predecessor have different accounting policies with respect to certain matters see note 4 to the notes to consolidated financial statements investors are cautioned that the forwardlooking statements contained in this section involve both risk and uncertainty several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are therefore beyond the control of management see ‘‘forwardlooking information’’ located at the end of this section 

the results for the nine months ended december 31 2005 and the three months ended march 31 2005 have not been audited together with the results of the nine months ended december 31 2003 and the three months ended march 31 2003 and should not be taken as an indication of the results of operations to be reported for any subsequent period or for the full fiscal year 

reconciliation of nonus gaap measures management believes that using nonus gaap financial measures to supplement us gaap results is useful to investors because such use provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business other than disclosing us gaap results alone in this regard we disclose net debt which is a nonus gaap financial measure net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents management uses net debt to evaluate the capital structure net debt is not a substitute for any us gaap financial measure in addition calculations of net debt contained in this report may not be consistent with that of other companies the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with us gaap in our financial statements for net debt is total debt for a reconciliation of net debt and total debt see ‘‘financial highlights’’ below for a reconciliation of trade working capital to working capital see selected financial data 

basis of presentation

successor 

represents our audited consolidated financial position as of december 31 2005 and 2004 and our audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 these consolidated financial statements reflect the application of purchase accounting described below relating to the original acquisition of cag and purchase price accounting adjustments relating to the acquisitions of vinamul acetex and additional cag shares acquired during the year ended december 31 2005

predecessor 

represents cag’s audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003 its audited interim consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three 

months ended march 31 2004 and its unaudited interim consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended march 31 2003 and the nine months ended december 31 2003 these consolidated financial statements relate to periods prior to the acquisition of cag and present cag’s historical basis of accounting without the application of purchase accounting

the results of the successor are not comparable to the results of the predecessor due to the difference in the basis of presentation of purchase accounting as compared to historical cost furthermore the successor and the predecessor have different accounting policies with respect to certain matters

change in ownership

pursuant to a voluntary tender offer commenced in february 2004 the purchaser an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of celanese corporation on april 6 2004 acquired approximately 84 of the ordinary shares of cag excluding treasury shares the ‘‘cag shares’’ for a purchase price of 1693 million including direct acquisition costs of 69 million the ‘‘acquisition’’ during the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 the purchaser acquired additional cag shares for 473 million and 33 million respectively including direct acquisition costs of 4 million and less than 1 million respectively the additional cag shares were acquired pursuant to either i the mandatory offer which commenced in september 2004 and was extended such that it will expire on april 1 2006 unless further extended or ii the acquisition of additional cag shares as described below

as part of the initial acquisition of cag the purchaser agreed to refinance certain existing debt of cag prefund certain pension obligations of cag prefund certain contingencies and certain obligations linked to the value of cag such as the payment of fair cash compensation under a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement ‘‘domination agreement’’ for the remaining outstanding cag shares and payment obligations related to outstanding stock appreciation rights stock options and interest payments provide additional funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes and pay related fees and expenses

the funds used in connection with the initial acquisition of cag were provided by equity investments of 641 million from the blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 1 blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 2 and blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 3 collectively ‘‘blackstone’’ and ba capital investors sidecar fund lp and together with blackstone the ‘‘original shareholders’’ term loans of approximately 608 million borrowings under senior subordinated bridge loan facilities of 1565 million as well as the issuance of mandatorilly redeemable preferred stock totaling 200 million the senior subordinated bridge loan facilities have since been refinanced by the senior subordinated notes and the floating rate term loan as a result of the financing our interest expense currently is and will continue to be substantially higher than it was prior to the acquisition

we accounted for the initial acquisition of cag using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly this resulted in a new basis of accounting the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were reflected at fair value for the approximately 84 portion acquired and at cag historical basis for the remaining approximate 16 the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired at closing was allocated to goodwill and this indefinite lived asset is subject to an annual impairment review during the three months ended march 31 2005 we finalized the purchase accounting adjustments for the original acquisition of cag see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements

during the year ended december 31 2005 we decreased goodwill by 26 million as a result of purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition and the acquisition of additional cag shares included in this adjustment is a 23 million increase to goodwill and a corresponding increase to our minority interest liability primarily associated with the restructuring that occurred in october 2004 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we also increased goodwill by 5 million net for various purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of additional cag shares as these represented immaterial adjustments individually and in the aggregate prior periods have not been restated also included in this adjustment is a 54 million decrease to goodwill associated with the additional cag shares purchased based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

in connection with the acquisition at the acquisition date we implemented a plan to restructure certain activities we recorded liabilities of 60 million primarily for employee severance and related costs in connection with the preliminary plan and have approved the continuation of all existing predecessor restructuring and exit plans see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

      initial public offering and concurrent financings

in january 2005 we completed an initial public offering of 50000000 shares of series a common stock and received net proceeds of 752 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of 48 million concurrently we received net proceeds of 233 million from the offering of our convertible perpetual preferred stock a portion of the proceeds of the share offerings were used to redeem 188 million of senior discount notes and 521 million of senior subordinated notes excluding early redemption premiums of 19 million and 51 million respectively

subsequent to the closing of the initial public offering we borrowed an additional 1135 million under the amended and restated senior credit facilities a portion of which was used to repay a 350 million floating rate term loan and 200 million of which was used as the primary financing for the february 2005 acquisition of vinamul additionally the amended and restated senior credit facilities included a 242 million delayed draw term loan which expired unutilized in july 2005

on april 7 2005 we used the remaining proceeds of the initial public offering and concurrent financings to pay a special cash dividend declared on march 8 2005 to holders of our series b common stock of 804 million upon payment of the 804 million dividend all of the outstanding shares of series b common stock converted automatically into shares of series a common stock on march 9 2005 we issued a 7500000 series a common stock dividend to the holders of our series b common stock

acquisition of additional cag shares

on august 24 2005 we acquired 59 million or approximately 12 of the outstanding cag shares from two shareholders for €302 million 369 million we also paid to such shareholders €12 million 15 million in consideration for the settlement of certain claims and for such shareholders agreeing to among other things 1 accept the shareholders resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting of cag held on july 30 and 31 2004 and the annual general meeting of cag held on may 19 and 20 2005 2 acknowledge the legal effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement 3 irrevocably withdraw and abandon all actions applications and appeals each brought or joined in legal proceedings related to among other things challenging the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement and amount of fair cash compensation offered by the purchaser in the mandatory offer required by section 3051 of the 

german stock corporation act 4 refrain from acquiring any cag shares or any other investment in cag and 5 refrain from taking any future legal action with respect to shareholder resolutions or corporate actions of cag we paid the aggregate consideration of €314 million 384 million for the additional cag shares using available cash

we also made a limited offer to purchase from all other shareholders any remaining outstanding cag shares for €51 per share plus interest on €4192 per share against waiver of the shareholders’ rights to participate in an increase of the offer consideration as a result of the pending award proceedings in addition all shareholders who tendered their shares pursuant to the september 2004 mandatory offer of €4192 per share were entitled to claim the difference between the increased offer and the mandatory offer the limited offer period ran from august 30 2005 through september 29 2005 inclusive for shareholders who did not accept the limited offer on or prior to the september 29 2005 expiration date the terms of the original mandatory offer continue to apply the mandatory offer will remain open for two months following final resolution of the award proceedings  spruchverfahren by the german courts

as of december 31 2005 and 2004 our ownership interest in cag was approximately 98 and 84 respectively on november 3 2005 our board of directors approved commencement of the process for effecting a squeezeout of the remaining shareholders as defined below

squeezeout

because we own shares representing more than 95 of the registered ordinary share capital excluding treasury shares of cag we have decided to exercise our right as permitted under german law to the transfer of the shares owned by the outstanding minority shareholders of cag in exchange for fair cash compensation the ‘‘squeezeout’’ the squeezeout will require the approval by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at cag’s annual general meeting in may 2006 and will become effective upon its registration in the commercial register if we are successful in effecting the squeezeout we must pay the then remaining minority shareholders of cag fair cash compensation in exchange for their shares the amount of the fair cash compensation per share has been set at €6222 the amount to be paid to the minority shareholders as fair cash compensation in exchange for their cag shares in connection with the squeezeout was determined on the basis of the fair value of cag determined by us in accordance with applicable german legal requirements as of the date of the applicable resolution of cag’s shareholders’ meeting and examined by a duly qualified auditor chosen and appointed by the frankfurt district court  landgericht 

the squeezeout will require approval by the shareholders of cag while it is expected that we will have the requisite majority in such meeting to assure approval of such measures minority shareholders irrespective of the size of their shareholding may within one month from the date of any such shareholder resolution file an action with the court to have such resolution set aside while such action would only be successful if the resolution were passed in violation of applicable laws and cannot be based on the unfairness of the amount to be paid to the minority shareholders a shareholder action may substantially delay the implementation of the challenged shareholder resolution pending final resolution of the action if such action proved to be successful the action could prevent the implementation of the squeezeout accordingly there can be no assurance that the squeezeout can be implemented timely or at all

impact of the acquisitions of vinamul and acetex

in february 2005 we acquired vinamul the north american and european emulsion polymer business of imperial chemical industries plc ‘‘ici’’ for 208 million the vinamul product line includes vinyl acetateethylene copolymers vinyl acetate homopolymers and copolymers and acrylic and vinyl acrylic emulsions vinamul operates manufacturing facilities in the united states canada the united kingdom and the netherlands as part of the agreement ici will continue to supply vinamul with starch dextrin and other specialty ingredients following the acquisition we will supply ici with vinyl acetate monomer and polyvinyl alcohols the supply agreements are for fifteen years

overview – nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with nine months ended december 31 2004

net sales in the nine months ended december 31 2005 increased 23 to 4592 million compared to the same period in 2004 the improvement is primarily due to an 11 increase in net sales from the vinamul and acetex businesses and 11 higher pricing mainly in chemical products offset by slightly lower volumes net sales from vinamul and acetex were approximately 280 million and 247 million respectively

our performance improved over 2004 as increased pricing and cost savings initiatives more than offset higher raw material and energy costs as a result our operating profit margin increased to 88 for the nine months ended december 31 2005 from 19 in the same period in 2004 for the nine months ended december 31 2005 vinamul and acetex including at plastics had operating losses of 15 million and 4 million respectively primarily related to integration costs in connection with the acquisitions and inventory purchase accounting adjustments for acetex

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests for the nine months ended december 31 2005 increased to 349 million compared to a net loss of 180 million in the same period in 2004 this increase is primarily due to higher operating profit lower interest expense and higher dividend income interest expense in 2004 included the expensing of deferred financing costs of 89 million and a prepayment premium of 21 million associated with the refinancing of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock this increase was partially offset by a 21 million increase in 2005 in interest expense due to higher debt levels and higher interest rates earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests for the nine months ended december 31 2005 includes an 11 million net loss on disposition of assets compared to a 3 million net gain on disposition of assets in the same period in 2004 the net earnings for the nine months ended december 31 2005 includes a 35 million loss on the disposal of ticona’s coc business offset by a 23 million gain on the disposition of two acetate products properties and 1 million in other gains net

net earnings loss for the nine months ended december 31 2005 improved to net earnings of 287 million compared to a net loss of 253 million for the same period in 2004

net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents rose to 3047 million at december 31 2005 from 2549 million at december 31 2004 primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 448 million we largely used available cash to finance the vinamul and acetex acquisitions the redemption of acetex senior notes and the purchase of the additional cag shares from two minority shareholders

in september 2005 we announced a controlled shutdown of our plants in clear lake pasadena bay city and bishop texas in preparation for hurricane rita we subsequently announced that these plants sustained minimal damage from this hurricane and production resumed at these plants in october 2005 we believe the hurricane had an aggregate negative impact on earnings of approximately 15 million during the nine months ended december 31 2005

in the three months ended march 31 2005 net sales rose 21 to 1478 million compared to 1218 million in the same period in 2004 primarily due to higher pricing higher volumes favorable currency movements and product composition changes of which 66 million was related to the vinamul acquisition net earnings loss declined to a net loss of 10 million compared to net earnings of 78 million in the same period in 2004 largely due to higher interest expense which included 102 million in debt refinancing related costs comprised of early redemption premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of 74 million and 28 million respectively and higher special charges mainly due to 35 million in expenses for the termination of sponsor monitoring services the three months ended march 31 2005 benefited from higher pricing mainly in chemical products driven by strong demand and higher industry capacity utilization we also benefited from cost savings resulting from restructuring and productivity improvement programs as well as lower depreciation and amortization these benefits were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs

overview – nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003

all business segments experienced volume growth in the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 the chemical products segment benefited from stronger overall demand while the ticona segment grew on new commercial applications and stronger demand from the automotive electricalelectronics household goods and medical markets the performance of ticona’s affiliates also reflected improved business conditions the overall economic environment however remained challenging due to higher raw material and energy costs as well as weaker pricing for some products in the ticona and performance products segments compared to the same period in 2003

net sales in the nine months ended december 31 2004 rose 12 to 3744 million compared to net sales for the same period in 2003 mainly on higher volumes in all business segments stronger pricing in chemical products and favorable currency effects which were partially offset by lower pricing in the remaining segments and changes in the composition of the chemical products segment

operating profit increased to 72 million from 22 million in the same period in 2003 operating profit benefited from increased net sales lower stock appreciation rights expense of 76 million as well as cost savings these factors were partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs higher special charges of 78 million expenses associated with a new management compensation plan of 50 million and higher professional and consulting fees for the nine months ended december 31 2004 operating profit included lower depreciation and amortization of 38 million resulting primarily from purchase accounting adjustments and a noncash charge of 53 million in inventoryrelated purchase accounting adjustments

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to a loss of 180 million from earnings of 84 million in the same period in 2003 mainly due to an increase in interest expense of 263 million resulting from the higher debt levels and the expensing of deferred financing costs of 89 million and the absence of 18 million in income from the demutualization of an insurance provider which was partially offset by higher operating profit of 50 million

net earnings loss decreased to a loss of 253 million compared to earnings of 92 million for the same period a year earlier

net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents rose to 2549 million from 489 million as of december 31 2003 primarily to finance the acquisition of cag and to prefund benefit obligations

overview – three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003

in the three months ended march 31 2004 all of the predecesor’s businesses experienced strong volume growth compared to the same period the previous year and benefited from increased activity in some of its markets such as electricalelectronics new applications for technical polymers and food ingredients and tight supply conditions in the acetyl products markets operating profit declined however due to higher raw material and energy costs special charges and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights which were partially offset by favorable currency effects

net sales increased 7 to 1218 million due to volume increases and favorable currency effects resulting mainly from the stronger euro versus the us dollar volume increases were particularly strong in the acetate products and ticona segments these factors were partially offset by the effects of transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests were 67 million compared to 88 million in the comparable period in 2003 net earnings loss increased to 78 million from 56 million in the same period in 2003

chemical products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with nine months ended december 31 2004 

chemical products’ net sales increased 28 to 3292 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of net sales from vinamul and acetex excluding at plastics during 2005 of approximately 280 million and 135 million respectively in addition pricing increased for most products but primarily from acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer and acetyl derivatives the price increase was driven by continued strong demand high industry utilization in base products and higher raw material costs particularly for ethylene and 

natural gas overall volumes declined 3 primarily from acetyl derivatives partially offset by significantly improved volumes from vinyl acetate monomer volumes for emulsions was flat the increase in volumes from vinyl acetate monomer is primarily driven by continued strong demand

special charges increased by 21 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 included in 2005 is 12 million in charges for a change in the environmental remediation strategy related to the closure of the edmonton methanol plant and 6 million for severance charges related to the same closure

operating profit increased 60 to 396 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the increase is principally driven by higher pricing which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs the segment also benefited from a full quarter impact of its southern chemical methanol supply contract basic products such as acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer had greater success in maintaining margins while downstream products such as polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions continued to experience margin compression due to raw material costs rising faster than our pricing operating profit was also favorably impacted in this period due to 36 million from the settlement of transportationrelated antitrust matters 14 million in lower noncash inventoryrelated purchase accounting adjustments and acetex excluding at plastics recording an operating profit of 11 million in the nine months ended december 31 2005 the increase in operating profit was partially offset by vinamul recording operating losses of 15 million which included integration costs in connection with the acquisition additionally depreciation and amortization increased in 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments in both years

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased 74 to 462 million compared to the same period in 2004 benefiting from increased operating profit and dividends from our saudi cost investment

three months ended march 31 2005 compared with three months ended march 31 2004 

chemical products net sales increased 28 to 1044 million compared to the same period last year mainly on higher pricing segment composition changes of which 66 million was related to vinamul and favorable currency effects pricing increased for most products driven by continued strong demand and high utilization rates across the chemical industry

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 193 million from 64 million in the same period in 2004 as higher pricing was partially offset by higher raw material costs earnings also benefited from an increase of 9 million in dividends from our saudi cost investment which totaled 12 million in the quarter the three months ended march 31 2005 included 1 million in earnings from vinamul which included 1 million in noncash inventory related purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs in connection with the acquisition

technical polymers ticona 

 

nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with nine months ended december 31 2004 

ticona’s net sales increased 2 to 648 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 the increase is primarily driven by the successful implementation of price increases introduction of new applications and increased penetration into key markets this increase is partially offset by lower overall volumes and slightly unfavorable currency effects improved volumes from most of ticona’s product lines were more than offset by a decline in polyacetal volumes attributable to a weak european automotive market and reduced sales to lowerend applications

ticona recorded income from special charges of 9 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to expense of 37 million for the same period in 2004 included in 2005 is approximately 34 million associated with plumbing insurance recoveries which was partially offset by an additional 25 million noncash impairment charge associated with the planned disposal of the coc business the 37 million in 2004 is primarily related to a noncash impairment charge from the coc business

operating profit increased to 21 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to an operating loss of 12 million for the same period in 2004 the successful implementation of price increases helped to offset higher raw material and energy costs also contributing to the increase are productivity improvements cost savings from an organizational redesign and lower depreciation and amortization expenses due to changes in the useful lives of certain property plant and equipment in addition 2004 included a 20 million charge to cost of sales for a noncash inventory related purchase accounting adjustment operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2005 includes approximately 35 million for the loss on disposal of the coc business compared to an impairment charge of 32 million taken in 2004

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 65 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to 26 million in the same period in 2004 this increase is primarily due to the increase in operating profit improved equity earnings from asian and us affiliates due to increased sales volumes a 46 million reduction in special charges and the absence of a 2004 purchase accounting adjustment of 20 million in 2005

three months ended march 31 2005 compared with three months ended march 31 2004 

net sales for ticona increased by 5 to 239 million compared to the same period last year due to favorable currency effects and slightly higher volumes volumes increased for most product lines due to the successful introduction of new applications which outweighed declines in polyacetal volumes 

resulting from our focus on highend business and decreased sales to european automotive customers overall pricing remained flat over the same periods as successfully implemented price increases were offset by lower average pricing for certain products due to the commercialization of lower cost grades for new applications

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased 13 to 51 million as the result of restructuring cost savings the favorable effects of a planned maintenance turnaround and slightly higher volumes these increases were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs

acetate products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with nine months ended december 31 2004 

acetate products’ net sales for the nine months ended december 31 2005 increased 12 to 494 million compared to the same period in 2004 the improvement is due to a 5 increase in pricing and a 7 increase in overall volumes higher flake volumes from increased sales to our recently expanded china tow ventures were partially offset by lower tow volumes due to the shutdown of our edmonton canada tow plant price increases partially offset higher raw material and energy costs

for the nine months ended december 31 2005 the acetate products’ segment recorded special charges of 8 million compared to 41 million in the same period in 2004 special charges gains in 2005 primarily related to a change in the environmental remediation strategy related to the closure of the edmonton methanol plant while special charges gains in the same period in 2004 primarily represented asset impairments associated with the planned consolidation of tow and flake production

operating profit increased to 57 million in the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to an operating loss of 17 million in the same period in 2004 the increase is largely due to the decrease in special charges gains described above and a 23 million gain on the sale of the rock hill sc plant and the charlotte nc research and development center in addition depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily resulting from a lower depreciable assets base due to previous asset impairments and an 8 million charge for asset retirement obligations recorded in 2004 associated with the restructuring of the business higher pricing and savings from restructuring and productivity improvements more than offset increased raw material and energy costs as well as temporarily higher manufacturing costs resulting from a realignment of inventory levels as part of the restructuring strategy

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 61 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to a 13 million loss from continuing operations in the same period in 2004 this increase is primarily due to the increase in operating profit which included 33 million in lower special charges and the 23 million gain on disposition of assets

three months ended march 31 2005 compared with three months ended march 31 2004 

net sales for acetate products increased by 12 to 165 million compared to the same quarter last year on higher volumes and pricing flake volumes increased due to higher sales to our recently expanded china tow ventures pricing increased to partially offset higher raw material and energy costs

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests more than doubled from 4 million in first quarter last year to 10 million this year due to increased volumes pricing and productivity improvements which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs earnings also benefited from 2 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense largely as a result of previous restructuring impairments which was partly offset by 3 million of expense for an asset retirement obligation

performance products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with nine months ended december 31 2004 

net sales for the performance products segment increased 2 to 133 million compared to 131 million in the same period in 2004 the increase is primarily due to higher volumes for the sunett ® sweetener partially offset by lower pricing the increased volumes for sunett reflects continuous growth from new and existing applications mainly in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets pricing for sunett declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers which is consistent with our positioning strategy for the product the pricing decrease for sunett was also driven by the expiration of a primary european and us production patent for sunett at the end of march 2005 pricing for sorbates increased in 2005 although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the industry

operating profit increased 111 from the same period in 2004 the increase is driven by improved business conditions for sorbates as well as the results of various ongoing cost savings initiatives in addition 2005 included a 3 million gain on the sale of the omega3 dha business as part of management’s strategy to sharpen its focus on the core sweetener and food protection businesses 2004 included a 12 million charge to cost of sales for a noncash inventoryrelated purchase accounting adjustment

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased 127 primarily due to the increase in operating profit which principally resulted from the absence of the purchase accounting charge in 2005 and the gain on the sale of the omega3 dha business

three months ended march 31 2005 compared with three months ended march 31 2004 

net sales for the performance products segment increased by 7 to 47 million compared to the same period last year mainly on higher volumes which more than offset lower pricing favorable currency movements also contributed to the sales increase higher volumes for sunett sweetener reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets pricing for sunett declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers the pricing decrease for sunett was also driven by the expiration of a primary european and us production patent for sunett at the end of march 2005 pricing for sorbates continued to recover although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the industry

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 12 million from 11 million in the same quarter last year strong volumes for sunett as well as favorable currency movements and cost savings outpaced lower pricing for the sweetener

  other activities 

other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including financing and administrative activities and certain other operating entities including the captive insurance companies and the at plastics business at plastics is a business acquired in connection with the acquisition of acetex in july 2005

nine months ended december 31 2005 compared with nine months ended december 31 2004 

net sales for other activities increased to 132 million from 45 million in the same period in 2004 the increase is primarily due to the addition of 112 million in net sales from the at plastics business which was partially offset by 13 million in lower third party revenues from the captive insurance companies and 7 million related to the divestitures of the performance polymer polybenzamidazole and vectran polymer fiber businesses in the second quarter of 2005

the operating loss of other activities decreased to 107 million for the nine months ended december 31 2005 compared to 165 million for the same period in 2004 this decrease was primarily due to the absence of 38 million in management incentive compensation expenses which were recorded in 2004 and lower ipo related consulting and professional fees the management incentive compensation expenses included charges related to a new deferred compensation plan a new stock incentive plan and other executive bonuses the decrease is partially offset by operating losses from at plastics of 15 million in 2005

loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests improved to a loss of 273 million from a loss of 473 million in the same period in 2004 the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in operating losses discussed above and a decrease in interest expense of 89 million the decrease in interest expense is due to expensing deferred financing costs of 89 million and a prepayment premium of 21 million associated with the refinancing of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in 2004 the decrease was partially offset by a 21 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels and interest rates in 2005

three months ended march 31 2005 compared with three months ended march 31 2004 

net sales for other activities increased slightly to 12 million from 11 million in the same quarter last year loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 253 million from a loss of 57 million in the same period last year largely due to 169 million of higher interest expense related to refinancing costs increased debt levels and higher interest rates in 2005 the loss includes 45 million of expenses for sponsor monitoring and related cancellation fees compared to special charges of 25 million in the same period in 2004 for advisory services related to the acquisition of cag

chemical products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

chemical products’ net sales increased by 12 to 2573 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from the comparable period last year as higher selling prices 10 increased volumes 4 and favorable currency movements 4 were partially offset by changes in the composition of the segment 6

pricing increased for most products particularly vinyl acetate monomer acetic acid and acetyl derivative products driven by high industry utilization and higher costs for raw materials volumes also increased particularly for vinyl acetate monomer polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions due to strong overall demand

the changes in the composition of the segment result from the transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003 2 and a change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates products which were formerly sold into the merchant market are now being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement 4 only the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net sales

operating profit increased to 248 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from 86 million in the same period last year higher pricing higher volumes as well as favorable currency effects were partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs operating profit was also favorably impacted by lower stock appreciation rights expense of 18 million and the absence of a 5 million loss from the european oxo business as well as a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 30 million largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 17 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 265 million compared to 115 million for the nine months ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher operating profit which included one time adjustments such as the significant decline in stock appreciation rights expense and the absence of purchase accounting adjustments in 2003 this was partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and lower equity in net earnings of affiliates due to restructuring charges in the european oxo venture

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

chemical products’ net sales increased by 7 to 818 million in the three months ended march 31 2004 from the comparable period last year as increased volumes 5 favorable currency movements 5 and higher selling prices 2 were partially offset by the effects of the transfer of the european oxo business into a venture 4 as well as a change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates products which were formerly sold into the merchant market are now being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement 1 only the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net sales

volumes and pricing for most acetyl products particularly vinyl acetate monomer increased in most regions due to a temporary competitor outage and stronger overall demand

operating profit increased to 65 million in the three months ended march 31 2004 from 52 million in the same period last year higher volumes and selling prices as well as favorable currency effects were partially offset by increased raw material costs and spending associated with productivity initiatives increased energy costs the transfer of the european oxo business and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights of 4 million

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 64 million compared to 60 million in the three months ended march 31 2004 primarily due to a higher operating profit partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and our share of the loss generated by our european oxo venture

net sales for ticona increased by 12 to 636 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period last year strong volume increases 11 and favorable currency effects 5 were partly offset by a decline in pricing 4

volumes grew in all product lines particularly in core products polyacetal volumes grew on stronger sales in the automotive and medical industries in north america while european sales benefited from greater demand for uses in consumer products and the commercialization of new applications volumes for vectra liquid crystal polymers rose in north america and europe due to new commercial applications such as household goods and stronger sales to the electricalelectronics industry gur ultra high 

molecular weight polyethylene grew as a result of increased sales for new specialty applications and stronger sales to asia overall pricing declined due to changes in product mix and ongoing competitive pressure from asian exports of polyacetal into north america and europe

ticona recorded special charges of 37 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to income from special charges of 87 million for the same period last year the special charges in 2004 are mainly related to a 32 million noncash impairment charge associated with a plan to dispose of the coc business income from special charges in 2003 consisted of insurance recoveries related to the plumbing cases of 107 million which were partially offset by 20 million in organizational redesign costs

operating profit decreased to a loss of 12 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from an operating profit of 103 million for the same period last year principally due to the impact of changes in special charges mentioned above results for the nine months ended december 31 2004 benefited from higher volumes lower stock appreciation rights expense of 17 million and productivity improvements these factors were partly offset by higher raw material and energy costs operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 20 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to 26 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from 140 million for the same period in 2003 this decrease resulted primarily from the changes in operating profit and lower interest income related to insurance recoveries which was partly offset by improved equity earnings from asian and us affiliates due to increased sales volumes

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

net sales for ticona increased by 16 to 227 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 compared to the same period last year as higher volumes 13 and favorable currency movements 8 was partially offset by lower selling prices −5

volumes increased in most business lines particularly in polyacetal and vectra liquid crystal polymers polyacetal volumes grew in north america and europe on sales to new end uses and higher sales to the north american automotive market volumes for vectra rose due to new commercial applications in north america and europe and stronger sales to the electricalelectronics industry pricing declined as lower priced products constituted a higher percentage of sales and competitive pressure continued from asian imports of polyacetal into north america

operating profit increased to 31 million versus 19 million in the same period last year due to higher volumes lower average production costs for vectra reduced spending partly resulting from the closure of the telford uk production facility in 2003 and favorable currency movements these increases were partially offset by lower pricing as well as the absence of 5 million of income from stock appreciation rights

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 45 million compared to 27 million in the same period in 2003 this increase resulted from the higher operating profit and improved equity earnings from our polyplastics and fortron industries affiliates due to increased sales volumes

acetate products’ net sales in the first three months ended march 31 2004 increased by 4 to 147 million compared to the same period in 2003 primarily due to higher volumes 4 average pricing remained unchanged volumes grew on higher sales of tow particularly in china

operating profit and earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests rose to 4 million compared to 2 million in the same period last year on higher volumes of tow as well as productivity gains these increases more than offset higher raw material costs

performance products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

net sales for the performance products segment which consists of the nutrinova food ingredients and sorbates businesses increased by 2 to 131 million compared to the same period last year as increased volumes 14 and favorable currency effects 4 were principally offset by price decreases 16

increased volumes for sunett sweetener reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets consistent with our strategy pricing for sunett declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers and the anticipated expiration of the primary european and us production patents at the end of march 2005 pricing for sorbates which had been under pressure from asian producers began to stabilize although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the industry

operating profit increased to 18 million compared to loss of 56 million in the same period last year which included special charges gains of 95 million related to antitrust matters in the sorbates industry operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 12 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold and higher depreciation and amortization expense of 5 million largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

net sales for the performance products segment increased by 7 to 44 million primarily due to increased volumes 7

pricing for sunett sweetener declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers an overall price decline in the high intensity sweetener market and the anticipated expiration of the european and us production patents at the end of march 2005 increased sunett volumes reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets in sorbates pricing and volume pressure from asian producers continued due to worldwide overcapacity

operating profit and earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests declined to 11 million compared to 12 million in the same period last year primarily due to lower pricing higher sunett volumes and currency movements partly offset this decline

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows

net cash provided byused in operating activities

cash flow from operating activities increased to a cash inflow of 714 million in 2005 compared to a cash outflow of 170 million for the same period in 2004 this increase primarily resulted from a 452 million increase in net earnings from 2004 429 million in lower pension contributions and a 142 million increase in cash received for trade receivables due to better receivables turnover these increases were partially offset by 72 million in less cash from trade accounts payable as trade accounts payable grew but at a slower rate than in 2004 in addition we paid 77 million more interest payments and 45 million in monitoring fees

cash flow from operating activities decreased to a cash outflow of 170 million for 2004 compared to a cash inflow of 401 million for 2003 this decrease primarily resulted from 473 million of pension contributions which are 343 million more than 2003 additionally lower income from insurance recoveries the payment of a 95 million obligation to a third party as well as payments of 59 million associated with the exercising of stock appreciation rights in 2004 also contributed to this decrease these outflows were partially offset by a decline in payments associated with bonuses and income taxes as well as lower cash consumed through changes in trade receivables and trade payables the hedging of foreign currency net receivables primarily intercompany resulted in 17 million cash inflow in 2004 compared to 180 million inflow in 2003

net cash from investing activities decreased to a cash outflow of 1714 million in 2004 compared to a cash outflow of 275 million in 2003 the increased cash outflow primarily resulted from the acquisition of cag this increase was partially offset by higher net proceeds received from disposals of discontinued operations of 129 million and lower cash outflows related to higher net purchases of marketable securities of 22 million

our capital expenditures were 212 million 210 million and 211 million for the calendar years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively capital expenditures were primarily related to major replacements of equipment capacity expansions major investments to reduce future operating costs environmental health and safety initiatives and in 2004 the integration of a companywide sap platform capital expenditures in 2005 included costs for the expansion of our nanjing china site into an integrated chemical complex capital expenditures in 2004 included expenditures related to a new ticona research and administrative facility in florence kentucky and the expansion of production facilities for polyacetal in bishop texas and gur in oberhausen germany capital expenditures in 2003 included costs for the completion of a production facility for synthesis gas which is a primary raw material at the oberhausen site in germany capital expenditures remained below depreciation levels as management continued to make selective capital investments to enhance the market positions of its products

liquidity

the primary source of liquidity had been cash generated from operations which included cash inflows from currency hedging activities historically the primary liquidity requirements were for capital expenditures working capital pension contributions and investments our contractual obligations commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant and are substantially higher than historical amounts our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash generated from operations as well as existing cash on hand we have availability under our amended and restated credit facilities to assist if required in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations

we believe we will have available resources to meet both our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements including debt service if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be forced to use other means available to us such as to increase our borrowings under our lines of credit reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness

in january 2005 we completed an initial public offering of series a common stock and received net proceeds of approximately 752 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses of 48 million concurrently we received net proceeds of 233 million from the offering of its convertible preferred stock and borrowed an additional 1135 million under the amended and restated senior credit facilities a portion of the proceeds of the share offerings were used to redeem 188 million of senior discount notes and 521 million of senior subordinated notes which excludes early redemption premiums of 19 million and 51 million respectively we also used a portion of the proceeds from additional borrowings under our senior credit facilities to repay our 350 million floating rate term loan which excludes a 4 million early redemption premium and used 200 million of the proceeds as the primary financing for the acquisition of the vinamul emulsion business

on april 7 2005 we used the remaining proceeds to pay a special cash dividend to holders of our series b common stock of 804 million upon payment of the 804 million dividend all of the shares of celanese series b common stock converted automatically to shares of celanese series a common stock in addition we may use the available sources of liquidity to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of cag

as discussed above in 2005 we issued 240 million aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive when as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor cash dividends at the rate of 425 per annum or 106 per share of liquidation preference payable quarterly in arrears commencing on may 1 2005 dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of initial issuance this dividend is expected to result in an annual dividend payment of approximately 10 million accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at an annual rate of 425 the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our series a common stock at a conversion rate of approximately 125 shares of our series a common stock per 2500 liquidation preference of the preferred stock as of december 31 2005 we paid 8 million in aggregate dividends on our preferred stock in addition at december 31 2005 we had 2 million of accumulated but undeclared and unpaid dividends which were declared on january 5 2006 and paid on february 1 2006

in july 2005 our board of directors adopted a policy of declaring subject to legally available funds a quarterly cash dividend on each share of our series a common stock at an annual rate initially equal to approximately 10 of the 1600 initial public offering price per share of our series a common stock or 016 per share unless our board of directors in its sole discretion determines otherwise as of december 31 2005 we paid 13 million in aggregate dividends on our series a common stock based upon the number of outstanding shares as of december 31 2005 the anticipated annual cash dividend payment is approximately 25 million however there is no assurance that sufficient cash or surplus will be available to pay such dividend

as of december 31 2005 we had total debt of 3437 million and cash and cash equivalents of 390 million net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents increased to 3047 million from 2549 million as of december 31 2004 primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 448 million we largely used available cash to finance the acetex acquisition the redemption of acetex senior notes and the purchase of the additional cag shares from two minority shareholders

during the nine months ended december 31 2004 409 million was contributed to the pension plans in march 2005 we contributed an additional 63 million to the nonqualified pension plans rabbi trusts

we were initially capitalized by equity contributions totaling 641 million from the original shareholders on a stand alone basis celanese corporation and crystal us holdings 3 llc ‘‘crystal llc’’ the issuer of the senior discount notes have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own apart from the financing as such celanese corporation and crystal llc generally will depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the preferred stock the senior discount notes the senior subordinated notes the term loans and any revolving credit borrowings and guarantees

domination agreement undefinedat the cag annual shareholders’ meeting on june 15 2004 cag shareholders approved payment of a dividend on the cag shares for the fiscal year ended december 31 2003 of €012 per share for the nine month fiscal year ended on september 30 2004 cag was not able to pay a dividend to its shareholders due to losses incurred in the cag statutory accounts accordingly in the near term celanese corporation crystal llc and bcp crystal us holdings corp ‘‘bcp crystal’’ which issued the senior subordinated notes and term loans will use existing cash and borrowings from their subsidiaries subject to various restrictions including restrictions imposed by the senior credit facilities and indentures and by relevant provisions of german and other applicable laws to make interest payments if the domination agreement ceases to be operative the ability of celanese corporation and bcp crystal to meet their obligations will be materially and adversely affected

the domination agreement was approved at the cag extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on july 31 2004 the domination agreement between cag and the purchaser became effective on 

october 1 2004 when the domination agreement became effective the purchaser was obligated to offer to acquire all outstanding cag shares from the minority shareholders of cag in return for payment of fair cash compensation this offer will continue until two months following the date on which the decision on the last motion in award proceedings  spruchverfahren  as described in ‘‘legal proceedings— shareholder litigation’’ has been disposed of and has been published these award proceedings were dismissed in 2005 however the dismissal is still subject to appeal the amount of this fair cash compensation has been determined to be €4192 per share plus interest in accordance with applicable german law any minority shareholder who elects not to sell their shares to the purchaser will be entitled to remain a shareholder of cag and to receive from the purchaser a gross guaranteed fixed annual payment on their shares of €327 per cag share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any future dividend taking into account the circumstances and the tax rates at the time of entering into the domination agreement the net guaranteed fixed annual payment is €289 per share for a full fiscal year based upon the number of cag shares held by the minority shareholders as of december 31 2005 a net guaranteed fixed annual payment of 4 million is expected in 2006 in addition pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into on march 6 2006 with eleven minority shareholders who had filed lawsuits in the frankfurt district court landgericht  the fixed annual payment for the 20052006 fiscal year will also be paid on this date this will amount to an additional net aggregate amount of approximately 2 million the net guaranteed fixed annual payment may depending on applicable corporate tax rates in the future be higher lower or the same as €289

on march 10 2006 the purchaser set the cash compensation in relation to the transfer of shares held by the minority shareholders at €6222 per share the total amount of funds necessary to purchase such outstanding shares under the current offer of €6222 per share is approximately €58 million the company is currently evaluating the financial impact of this offer on its financial position results of operations and cash flows but does not believe that the impact will be material

while the domination agreement is operative the purchaser is required to compensate cag for any statutory annual loss incurred by cag the dominated entity at the end of its fiscal year when the loss was incurred if the purchaser were obligated to make cash payments to cag to cover an annual loss the purchaser may not have sufficient funds to pay interest when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of cag the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall the domination agreement cannot be terminated by the purchaser in the ordinary course until september 30 2009

our subsidiaries bcp caylux holdings luxembourg sca and bcp crystal have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing to strengthen the purchaser’s ability to fulfill its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement and to ensure that the purchaser will perform all of its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement when such obligations become due including without limitation the obligations to make a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the outstanding minority shareholders to offer to acquire all outstanding cag shares from the minority shareholders in return for payment of fair cash consideration and to compensate cag for any statutory annual loss incurred by cag during the term of the domination agreement if bcp caylux andor bcp crystal are obligated to make payments under such guarantees or other security to the purchaser andor the minority shareholders we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due

in the first quarter of 2005 we paid 10 million to affiliates of the blackstone group related to an advisor monitoring agreement this agreement was terminated concurrent with the initial public offering and resulted in an additional 35 million payment

in connection with the borrowing by bcp crystal under the term loan portion of the senior credit facilities bcp crystal and cac have entered into an intercompany loan agreement whereby bcp crystal has agreed to lend the proceeds from any borrowings under its term loan facility to cac the intercompany loan agreement contains the same amortization provisions as the senior credit facilities the interest rate with respect to the loans made under the intercompany loan agreement is the same as the interest rate with respect to the loans under bcp crystal’s term loan facility plus three basis points bcp crystal intends to service the indebtedness under its term loan facility with the proceeds of payments made to it by cac under the intercompany loan agreement

senior subordinated notes in february 2005 we used approximately 521 million of the net proceeds of the offering of our series a common stock to redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and 51 million to pay the premium associated with the redemption as of december 31 2005 the senior subordinated notes excluding 3 million of premiums consist of 797 million of 9 58 senior subordinated notes due 2014 and 153 million €130 million of 10 38 senior subordinated notes due 2014 all of bcp crystal’s obligations under the senior credit facilities guarantee the senior subordinated notes on an unsecured senior subordinated basis

other debt other debt of 399 million which does not include a 2 million fair value reduction due to purchase accounting is primarily made up of fixed rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds shortterm borrowings from affiliated companies and capital lease obligations

covenants the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes limit the ability of the issuers of such notes and the ability of their restricted subsidiaries to

      98

  subject to certain exceptions the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes permit the issuers of the notes and their restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness

the senior credit facilities contain a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions the ability of celanese holdings and its subsidiaries’ ability to

             in addition the senior credit facilities require bcp crystal to maintain the following financial covenants a maximum total leverage ratio a maximum bank debt leverage ratio a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures limitation

a breach of covenants of the senior credit facilities as of december 31 2005 that are tied to ratios based on adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ‘‘adjusted ebitda’’ as defined in our credit agreements could result in a default under the senior credit facilities and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable any such acceleration would also result in a default under the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes additionally under the senior credit facilities the floating rate term loan and the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior discount notes our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with these covenants the maximum consolidated net bank debt to adjusted ebitda ratio previously required under the senior credit facilities was eliminated when we amended the facilities in january 2005

covenant levels and ratios for the four quarters ended december 31 2005 are as follows

 

    contractual obligations the following table sets forth our fixed contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2005

 

  in the first quarter of 2005 we paid 10 million to affiliates of the blackstone group related to an advisor monitoring agreement this agreement was terminated concurrent with the initial public offering and resulted in an additional 35 million termination payment based upon the number of cag shares held by the minority shareholders as of december 31 2005 a net guaranteed fixed annual payment of 4 million is expected in 2006 in addition pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into on march 6 2006 with eleven minority shareholders who had filed lawsuits in the frankfurt district court landgericht  the fixed annual payment for the 20052006 fiscal year will also be paid on this date this will amount to an additional net aggregate amount of approximately 2 million these amounts are excluded from the above table

unconditional purchase obligations primarily include take or pay contracts we do not expect to incur any material losses under these contractual arrangements in addition these contracts may include variable price components

other contractual obligations primarily includes committed capital spending and fines associated with the us antitrust settlement described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included in other contractual obligations is a €99 million 117 million fine from the european commission related to antitrust matters in the sorbates industry which is pending an appeal we are indemnified by a third party for 80 of the expenses relating to these matters which is not reflected in the amount above

at december 31 2005 we have contractual guarantees and commitments as follows

 

we are secondarily liable under a lease agreement pursuant to which we have assigned a direct obligation to a third party the lease assumed by the third party expires on april 30 2012 the lease liability for the period from january 1 2006 to april 30 2012 is estimated to be approximately 49 million

standby letters of credit of 263 million at december 31 2005 are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain successor subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements the standby letters of credit include 199 million issued under the creditlinked revolving facility of which approximately 25 million relates to obligations associated with the sorbates antitrust matters as described in the ‘‘other contractual obligations’’ above

for additional commitments and contingencies see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements

other obligations

we expect to continue to incur costs for the following significant obligations although we cannot predict with certainty the annual spending for these matters such matters will affect our future cash flows

 

environmental matters

for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 the successor’s worldwide expenditures including expenditures for legal compliance internal environmental initiatives and remediation of active orphan divested and us superfund sites were 84 million and 66 million respectively the predecessor’s worldwide expenditures for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 were 22 million and 80 million respectively the successor’s capital project related environmental expenditures for the year ended december 31 2005 the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the predecessor’s for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 included in worldwide expenditures were 8 million 6 million 2 million and 10 million respectively environmental reserves for remediation matters were 124 million and 143 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively which represents our best estimate see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

it is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on the chemical industry in general management cannot predict with certainty future environmental expenditures especially expenditures beyond 2006 due to new air regulations in the us management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 35 million to 45 million through 2007 accordingly emission trading systems will directly affect the power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites in germany and the lanaken site in belgium as well as power plants operated by infraserv entities on sites at which we operate the company and the infraserv entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits which could result in increased operating costs or may be required to develop additional costeffective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further which could result in increased capital expenditures additionally the new regulation indirectly affects our other operations in the european union which may experience higher energy costs from third party providers we have not yet determined the impact of this legislation on our operating costs

due to our industrial history we have the obligation to remediate specific areas on our active sites as well as on divested orphan or us superfund sites in addition as part of the demerger agreement with hoechst a specified proportion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of predemerger divestitures was transferred to us management has provided for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable management believes that the environmental costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but they may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements

pension and other benefits

the funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations for the year ended december 31 2005 the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 pension contributions to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan amounted to 0 million 300 million and 33 million respectively contributions to the german pension plans for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 were 5 million and 105 million respectively also for the year ended december 31 2005 the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 payments to other nonqualified plans including rest of the world totaled 39 million 29 million and 6 million respectively

our spending associated with other benefit plans primarily retiree medical defined contribution and longterm disability amounted to 67 million 53 million and 9 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 respectively see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

in 2004 celanese amended its longterm disability plan to align the benefit levels with the retiree medical plan as a result of this change the employee contribution for the longterm disability medical coverage increased substantially for current participants in the disability plan subsequent to the adoption of the change enrollment in the plan has been trending downward with 20 of the participants declining coverage accordingly the company reduced the disability accrual by 9 million at december 31 2005 as a result of the lower enrollment experience in addition medical claims assumptions were lowered to reflect actual plan experience and the percentage of longterm disability medical payments paid for by medicare this change lowered the longterm disability accrual by an additional 9 million

other matters

plumbing actions and sorbates litigation

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business in february 2005 we settled with an insurance carrier and received cash proceeds of 44 million in march 2005 and in december 2005 we received 30 million in additional settlements for the nine months ended december 31 2004 there were no net cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation for the three months ended march 31 2004 and for the year ended december 31 2003 there were net cash inflows of approximately 0 million and 110 million in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation as of december 31 2005 and 2004 there were reserves of 

197 million and 218 million respectively for these matters in addition we have receivables from insurance companies and hoechst in connection with the plumbing and sorbates matters of 125 million and 191 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively

although it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters management believes based on the advice of legal counsel that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have not entered into any material offbalance arrangements

market risks

please see ‘‘quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk’’ under item 7a of this form 10k for additional information about our market risks

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements and application of these policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results

we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of the significant accounting policies

recoverability of longlived assets

our business is capital intensive and has required and will continue to require significant investments in property plant and equipment at december 31 2005 and 2004 the carrying amount of property plant and equipment was 2040 million and 1702 million respectively as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we assess the recoverability of property plant and equipment to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets

in december 2004 we approved a plan to dispose of the coc business included within the ticona segment this decision resulted in 25 million and 32 million of asset impairment charges recorded as a special charge related to the coc business in the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 respectively

as a result of the planned consolidation of tow production and the termination of filament production the acetate products segment recorded impairment charges of 50 million associated with plant and equipment in the nine months ended december 31 2004

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a twostep approach first the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value 

of the reporting unit a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities are fair valued the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the fair value of all nongoodwill assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit to the extent that the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had 1430 million and 1147 million respectively of goodwill and other intangible assets net

as of december 31 2005 no significant changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that drive the impairment analysis led management to believe goodwill might have been impaired we will continue to evaluate the need for impairment if changes in circumstances or available information indicate that impairment may have occurred we perform the required impairment tests at least annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june 30 balances unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing during 2005 we performed the impairment test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill

a prolonged general economic downturn and specifically a continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure create an imbalance of industry supply and demand or otherwise diminish volumes or profits such events combined with changes in interest rates could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our longlived assets consequently it is possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of our longlived assets

restructuring and special charges gains

special charges gains include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a decision to exit nonstrategic businesses these measures are based on formal management decisions establishment of agreements with the employees’ representatives or individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan the related reserves reflect certain estimates including those pertaining to separation costs settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at the end of each reporting period actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements

environmental liabilities

we manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world accordingly the businesses’ operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use handling processing storage and transportation of hazardous materials we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated if the event of loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable but is reasonably possible we provide appropriate disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

total reserves for environmental liabilities were 124 million and 143 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively measurement of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites an environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include for example provision for one or more of the following types of costs site investigation and testing costs cleanup costs costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and postremediation monitoring costs these reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on a range of management’s periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort we use our best estimate within the range to establish our environmental reserves we utilize third parties to assist in the management and the 

development of our cost estimates for our sites changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur we accrue for legal fees related to litigation matters when the costs associated with defense can be reasonably estimated and are probable to occur all other fees are expensed as incurred see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

asset retirement obligations

total reserves for asset retirement obligations were 54 million and 52 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively sfas no 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 fin no 47 provides guidelines as to when a company is required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation the liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded the corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life management has identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to substantially all its existing operating facilities examples of these types of obligations include demolition decommissioning disposal and restoration activities legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations however operations at these facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time in the future we will assess strategies of the businesses acquired and may support decisions that differ from past decisions of management regarding the continuing operations of existing facilities asset retirement obligations will be recorded if these strategies are changed and probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities if certain operating facilities were to close the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows

as a result of a worldwide assessment of our acetate production capacity the acetate products segment recorded a charge to depreciation expense of 8 million in 2003 related to potential asset retirement obligations the assessment concluded that there was a probability that certain facilities would be closed in the latter half of the decade in october 2004 we announced plans to consolidate flake and tow production by early 2007 and to discontinue production of filament before the end of 2005 in the fourth quarter of 2005 the operations of filament were discontinued and we disposed of two acetate properties as a result of the sales we recorded a gain of 23 million primarily resulting from the reversal of liabilities assumed by the purchaser for the nine months ended december 31 2004 we recorded a charge of 12 million included within depreciation expense of which 8 million was recorded by acetate products and 4 million by chemical products

realization of deferred tax assets

management regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized such evaluations require significant management judgments valuation allowances have been established primarily for us federal and state net operating losses carryforwards mexican net operating loss carryforwards and canadian deferred tax assets see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements

tax contingencies

the company has accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities the company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing

benefit obligations

pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements cac sponsors pension and other postretirement benefit plans with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the employee retirement income security act for the periods presented the predecessor or the company had not been required to contribute under these minimum funding requirements however the predecessor chose to contribute to the us defined benefit pension plan 33 million and 130 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 and for the year ended december 31 2003 respectively the successor chose to contribute to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan 0 million and 300 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 respectively contributions to the german pension plans for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 were 5 million and 105 million respectively benefits are generally based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate rates of increase in compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2005 and 2004 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan which represents greater than 85 and 75 of pension plan assets and liabilities respectively on average the actual return on plan assets over the longterm 15 to 20 years has exceeded 90 for the year ended december 31 2005 the us qualified defined benefit pension plan assets actual return was 50 basis points less than the expected longterm rate of return of plan assets however for the year ended december 31 2004 the actual return was 400 basis points higher than the longterm return on plan assets based on our investment strategy we believe that 85 is a reasonable longterm rate of return

we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 55 million in 2005 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities at december 31 2005 we lowered the discount rate to 563 from 588 at december 31 2004 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the us pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated 10 million and less than 1 million respectively and our benefit obligations by approximately 173 million and approximately 12 million respectively

over the past two years we have experienced significant increases in excess of 300 million in unrecognized net actuarial pension losses the losses were mainly due to the decline in the discount rate utilized to reflect current market conditions

other postretirement benefit plans plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the postretirement benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2005 the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 includes 25 million 21 million and 8 million respectively and the accrued postretirement liability was 408 million and 406 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively in other noncurrent liabilities the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ‘‘apbo’’ are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the apbo at december 31 2005 and the 2005 postretirement benefit cost by approximately 5 million and less than 1 million respectively and decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the apbo at december 31 2005 and the 2005 postretirement benefit cost by approximately 5 million and less than 1 million respectively see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

accounting for commitments and contingencies

we are subject to a number of legal proceedings lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust past waste disposal practices release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business management routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with sfas no 5 ‘‘ contingencies and commitments ’’ and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements

cna holdings which included the us business now conducted by the ticona segment along with shell oil company ‘‘shell’’ and e i du pont de nemours and company ‘‘dupont’’ and others has been a defendant in a series of lawsuits including a number of class actions alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail cna holdings has accrued its best estimate of its share of the plumbing actions at december 31 2005 and 2004 accruals were 68 million and 73 million respectively for this matter of which 6 million and 11 million respectively are included in current liabilities management believes that the plumbing actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements however if we were to incur an additional charge for this matter such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position but may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period the predecessor’s receivables relating to the anticipated recoveries from third party insurance carriers for this product liability matter are based on the probability of collection on the settlement agreements reached with a majority of the insurance carriers whose coverage level exceeds the receivables and based on the status of current discussions with other insurance carriers as of december 31 2005 and 2004 insurance claims receivables were 22 million and 75 million respectively collectibility could vary depending on the financial status of the insurance carriers

nutrinova inc a us subsidiary of nutrinova nutrition specialties  food ingredients gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of ours and the predecessor is party to various legal proceedings in the united states canada and europe alleging nutrinova inc engaged in unlawful anticompetitive behavior which affected the sorbates markets while it was a whollyowned subsidiary of hoechst in accordance with the demerger agreement between hoechst and cag which became effective october 1999 cag the successor to hoechst’s sorbates business was assigned the obligation related to these matters however hoechst agreed to indemnify cag for 80 of payments for such obligations expenses related to this 

matter are recorded gross of any such recoveries from hoechst while the recoveries from hoechst which represents 80 of such expenses are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity net of tax as a contribution of capital

based on the advice of external counsel and a review of the existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates matter including the status of government investigations as well as civil claims filed and settled we and the predecessor has remaining accruals of 129 million and 145 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively for the estimated loss relative to this matter this amount is included in current liabilities at december 31 2005 although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty management’s best estimate of the range of possible additional future losses and fines including any that may result from governmental proceedings as of december 31 2005 is between 0 million and 9 million the estimated range of such possible future losses is management’s best estimate based on advice of external counsel taking into consideration potential fines and claims both civil and criminal that may be imposed or made in other jurisdictions at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had receivables recorded within current assets relating to the sorbates indemnification from hoechst of 103 million and 116 million respectively

on february 7 2001 celanese international corporation ‘‘cic filed a private criminal action for patent infringement against china petrochemical development corporation or cpdc alleging that cpdc infringed cics patent covering the manufacture of acetic acid cic also filed a supplementary civil brief which in view of changes in taiwanese patent laws was subsequently converted to a civil action alleging damages against cpdc based on a period of infringement of ten years 19912000 and based on cpdcs own data and as reported to the taiwanese securities and exchange commission cics patent was held valid by the taiwanese patent office on august 31 2005 a taiwanese court held that cpdc infringed cic’s acetic acid patent and awarded cic approximately 28 million for the period of 1995 through 1999 the judgment has been appealed we will not record income associated with this favorable judgment until cash is received

cag the purchaser as well as a former member of cag’s board of management are defendants in various lawsuits in germany instituted by minority shareholders relating to the purchaser’s acquisition of the cag shares while many of these lawsuits request to set aside shareholders’ resolutions in connection with the domination agreement several minority shareholders had initiated special award proceedings  spruchverfahren  to increase the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  offered under the domination agreement as a result of these proceedings the amount of the fair cash consideration and the guaranteed fixed annual payment offered under the domination agreement could be increased by the court so that all minority shareholders including those who have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer and have received the fair cash compensation could claim the respective higher amounts although the court dismissed all of these proceedings in march 2005 on the grounds of inadmissibility the dismissal has been appealed

based upon the information available as of the date of this annual report the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with sfas no 5 ‘‘ contingencies and commitments ’’ and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

business combinations

upon closing an acquisition we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as soon as practicable given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company’s balance sheet frequently with implications for the purchase price of the acquisition then to adjust the acquired company’s accounting policies procedures books and records to our standards it is often several quarters before we are able to finalize those initial fair value estimates accordingly it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised the judgements made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact net earnings loss see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements

captive insurance companies

we consolidate two wholly owned insurance companies the ‘‘captives’’ the captives are a key component of our global risk management program as well as a form of selfinsurance for property liability and workers compensation risks the captives issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the insurance market and to lower longterm insurance costs by avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees the captives issue insurance policies and coordinate claims handling services with third party service providers they retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained one of the captives also insures certain third party risks

the assets of the captives consist primarily of marketable securities and reinsurance receivables marketable securities values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes the carrying value of the amounts recoverable under the reinsurance agreements approximate fair value due to the shortterm nature of these items

the liabilities recorded by the captives relate to the estimated risk of loss recorded by the captives which is based on management estimates and actuarial valuations and unearned premiums which represent the portion of the premiums written applicable to the terms of the policies in force the establishment of the provision for outstanding losses is based upon known facts and interpretation of circumstances influenced by a variety of factors in establishing a provision management considers facts currently known and the current state of laws and litigation where applicable liabilities are recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and management can reasonably estimate their liability in addition liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure on both known and unasserted claims estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities

the captives use reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss reinsurance arrangements however do not relieve the captives from their obligations to policyholders failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the captives the captives evaluate the financial condition of their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies and establish allowances for amounts deemed noncollectable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 148 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities  see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements

foreign exchange risk management

we and the predecessor have receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the various subsidiaries which create foreign exchange risk for the purposes of this document the predecessor’s reporting currency is the us dollar and the functional reporting currency of cag continues to be the euro the us dollar the euro mexican peso japanese yen british pound sterling and canadian dollar are the most significant sources of currency risk accordingly we 

enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the foreign currency contracts are designated for recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions the terms of these contracts are generally under one year our centralized hedging strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables or liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be internally hedged only the remaining net foreign exchange position will then be hedged externally with banks as a result foreign currency forward contracts relating to this centralized strategy did not meet the criteria of sfas no 133 to qualify for hedge accounting net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized on the underlying transactions which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts

on june 16 2004 as part of our currency risk management we entered into a currency swap with certain financial institutions under the terms of the swap arrangement we will pay approximately €13 million in interest and receive approximately 16 million in interest on each june 15 and december 15 with interest for the first period prorated upon maturity of the swap agreement on june 16 2008 we will pay approximately €276 million and receive approximately 333 million we designated the swap part of its senior euro term loan and a euro note as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2004 at december 31 2005 and 2004 the effects of the swap resulted in an increase in total liabilities of 4 million and 57 million respectively the loss related to the swap was 18 million and 21 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 of which 3 million in 2005 and 14 million in 2004 is related to the ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge

contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 564 million and 288 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively are predominantly in euros british pound sterling japanese yen and canadian dollars most of the our foreign currency forward contracts did not meet the criteria of sfas no 133 to qualify for hedge accounting we recognize net foreign currency transaction gains or losses which were offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2005 our foreign currency forward contracts resulted in an decrease in total assets of 4 million and a decrease in total liabilities of 4 million for the year ended december 31 2004 our foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets and an increase in total liabilities of 42 million and 2 million respectively as of december 31 2005 and 2004 these contracts in addition to natural hedges hedged approximately 100 of our net receivables held in currencies other than the entities’ functional currency for our european operations related to the unhedged portion during the period a net gain loss of approximately 20 million 2 million and 4 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense net for the six months ended december 31 2005 for the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 respectively during 2003 the predecessor’s foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets and of 8 million and an increase in total liabilities of 1 million as of december 31 2003 these contracts hedged a portion approximately 85 of the predecessor’s us dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated entities related to the unhedged portion a net loss of approximately 14 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense net in 2003

a substantial portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have and in the past have had a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect we estimate that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 0 and decreased total assets by approximately 6 for the year ended december 31 2005 increased net sales by approximately 3 and increased total assets by approximately 3 for the nine months ended december 31 2004 net sales increased by approximately 7 for the year ended december 31 2003 the predecessor estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 6 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and by approximately 7 for the year ended december 31 2003 the predecessor also estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other 

currencies against the us dollar decreased total assets by approximately 1 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and increased total assets by approximately 5 in 2003 exposure to transactional effects is further reduced by a high degree of overlap between the currencies in which sales are denominated and the currencies in which the raw material and other costs of goods sold are denominated

as of december 31 2005 we had total debt of 3437 million of which 614 million €520 million is euro denominated debt a 1 increase in foreign exchange rates would increase the euro denominated debt by 6 million as of december 31 2005 we had total cash of 390 million of which approximately 79 million €67 million is euro denominated cash a 1 decrease in foreign exchange rates would decrease the euro denominated cash by 1 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the euro denominated cash was reduced substantially by the purchase of the additional cag shares from two shareholders including other considerations as well as the acquisition of vinamul and acetex and the redemption of acetex’s debt

interest rate risk management

we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of fixedfloating rate debt depending on market conditions at december 31 2005 the successor had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of 300 million at december 31 2004 the successor had no interest rate swap agreements in place the predecessor had open interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 200 million at december 31 2003 in the second quarter of 2004 the successor recorded a loss of less than 1 million in other income expense net associated with the early termination of its 200 million interest rate swap during 2003 the predecessor recorded a loss of 7 million in other income expense net associated with the early termination of one of its interest rate swaps the successor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of 3 million and 1 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 respectively the predecessor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of 2 million and 11 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 respectively the predecessor recorded a net gain loss of less than 1 million and 2 million in other income expense net of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps during the three months ended march 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 respectively

on a pro forma basis as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 1900 million of variable rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 19 million 

commodity risk management

our policy for the majority of our natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts fixed price natural gas forward contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract the successor recognized losses of less than 1 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the year ended december 31 2005 and the nine months ended december 31 2004 the predecessor recognized losses of 1 million and 3 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 respectively there was no material impact on the balance sheet at december 31 2005 and 2004 there were no unrealized gains and losses associated with the cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we did not have any open commodity swaps as of december 31 2005 and 2004




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended december 31 2004 we identified a material weakness in our internal controls for the same period on march 30 2005 we received a letter from kpmg our independent auditors who also identified the same material weakness and a second material weakness in the course of their audit the additional material weakness identified by kpmg related to several deficiencies in the assessment of hedge effectiveness and documentation the required adjustments were made in the proper accounting period except for one immaterial hedging transaction adjusted during the quarter ended june 30 2005 the material weakness identified by kpmg and the company related to conditions preventing its ability to adequately research document review and draw conclusions on accounting and reporting matters which had previously resulted in adjustments that had to be recorded to prevent our financial statements from being materially misstated the conditions largely related to significant increases in the frequency of and the limited number of personnel available to address complex accounting matters and transactions and as a result of the consummation of simultaneous debts and equity offerings during the yearend closing process we do not believe that the adjustments made in connection with these material weaknesses had any material impact on previously reported financial information in response to the letter from kpmg with respect to the first material weakness identified above we organized a team responsible for the identification and documentation of potential derivative accounting transactions and commenced and concluded formal training for team members specifically related to derivative accounting with respect to the second material weakness identified above we hired certain qualified accounting personnel which should ensure that we will be able to adequately research document review and conclude on accounting and reporting matters both material weaknesses were identified during our december 31 2004 yearend closing process and we believe that we have remediated these material weaknesses as of december 31 2005

in september 2005 we identified a significant deficiency in internal controls relating to sales to countries and other parties that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government this significant deficiency was identified as a result of an internal investigation that was intiated in connection with the sec review of a registration statement we have taken immediate corrective actions which include a directive to senior business leaders stating that they are prohibited from selling products into certain countries subject to these trade restrictions as well as making accounting systems modifications that prevent the initiation of purchase orders and shipment of products to these countries also we plan to enhance the business conduct policy training in the area of export control although as of december 31 2005 this significant deficiency has not been fully remediated we believe that we have taken remediation measures that once fully implemented will be effective in eliminating this deficiency

celanese corporation celanese under the supervision and with the participation of celanese’s management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of celanese’s ‘‘disclosure controls and procedures’’ as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the ‘‘34 act’’ as of december 31 2005 disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the 34 act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission based on this evaluation and as a result of the remediation of the material weaknesses completed during the period covered by this annual report celanese’s ceo and cfo concluded that as of december 31 2005 the end of the period covered by this annual report celanese’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for gathering analyzing and disclosing the material information celanese is required to disclose in the reports it files under the 34 act within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commssion except as discussed above there have been no significant changes in celanese’s ‘‘internal controls over financial reporting’’ as defined in rule 13a15f under the 34 act as amended 

during the period covered by this annual report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal controls over financial reporting

we are in the process of implementing changes to strengthen our internal controls in addition while we have taken actions to address these deficiencies and weaknesses additional measures may be necessary and these measures along with other measures we expect to take to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified by us or ensure that our internal controls are effective if we are unable to correct existing or future deficiencies or weaknesses in internal controls in a timely manner our ability to record process summarize and report financial information within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec will be adversely affected this failure could materially and adversely impact our business our financial condition and the market value of our securities in addition there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in reliability of future financial statements and sec filings

beginning with the fiscal year ending december 31 2006 section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act will require us to include an internal control report of management with our annual report on form 10k the internal control report must contain 1 a statement of management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for us 2 a statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 3 management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and 4 a statement that our independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting

in connection therewith we are currently performing the system and process evaluation and testing required and any necessary remediation in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 in the course of our ongoing section 404 evaluation we have identified areas of internal controls that may need improvement and plan to design enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues that might be identified through this review as we are still in the evaluation process we may identify other conditions that may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future

we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance or our independent auditors are not able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the securities and exchange commission as a result there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in addition we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel any such action could negatively affect our results

competitive strengths

we have benefited from a number of competitive strengths including the following

leading market positions

we have 1 or 2 market positions globally in products that make up a majority of our sales according to the sri handbook and the tecnon orbichem survey we are a leading global producer of acetic acid and the worlds largest producer of vinyl acetate monomer ticona and our ventures polyplastics and kepco are leading suppliers of polyacetal products and other engineering resins in north america europe and the asiapacific region our leadership positions are based on our large share of global production capacity operating efficiencies proprietary technology and competitive cost structures in our major products

proprietary production technology and operating expertise

our production of acetyl products employs industry leading proprietary and licensed technologies including our proprietary ao plus acidoptimization technology for the production of acetic acid and vantage vinyl acetate monomer technology ao plus enables plant capacity to be increased with minimal investment while vantage enables significant increases in production efficiencies lower operating costs and increases in capacity at ten to fifteen percent of the cost of building a new plant

low cost producer

our competitive cost structures are based on economies of scale vertical integration technical knowhow and the use of advanced technologies

global reach

we operate 29 production facilities excluding our ventures throughout the world with major operations in north america europe and asia ventures owned by us and our partners operate ten additional facilities our infrastructure of manufacturing plants terminals and sales offices provides us with a competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the needs of our global and local customers in wellestablished and growing markets while our geographic diversity reduces the potential impact of volatility in any individual country or region we have a strong and growing presence in asia particularly in china where ventures owned by us and our partners operate three additional facilities

international strategic investments

our strategic investments including our ventures have enabled us to gain access minimize costs and accelerate growth in new markets while also generating significant cash flow and earnings our equity investments and cost investments represent an important component of our growth strategy during the nine months ended december 31 2004 we received 55 million in dividends from our strategic investments during the three months ended march 31 2004 we received 22 million in dividends and other distributions from our strategic investments

business strategies

we are focused on increasing operating cash flows profitability return on investment and shareholder value which we believe can be achieved through the following business strategies

maintain cost advantage and productivity leadership

we continually seek to reduce our production and raw material costs we announced in july 2003 that we intend to purchase most of our north american internal methanol requirements from southern 

chemical corporation beginning in july 2005 under a multiyear agreement at a lower cost than our present cost for methanol our advanced process control apc projects generate savings in energy and raw materials while increasing yields in production units most significantly we intend to intensify the implementation of six sigma which has become a pervasive and important tool in both operations and administration for achieving greater productivity and growth we are also engaged in several projects and process technology improvements focused on energy reduction for example by implementing modifications and improvements in the distillation systems at our calvert city kentucky polyvinyl alcohol plant we were able to achieve a 17 reduction in steam usage using less energyintense technology to more efficiently reduce acetic acid impurities at our clear lake plant has also enabled reductions in steam and electricity usage we intend to continue using best practices to reduce costs and increase equipment reliability in maintenance and project engineering

focused business investment

we intend to continue investing strategically in growth areas including new production capacity to extend our global market leadership position historically our strong market position has enabled us to initiate capacity growth to take advantage of projected demand growth for example we are building a 600000 metric ton per year worldscale acetic acid plant in china the worlds fastest growing market for acetic acid and its derivatives we also increased the capacity of our gur ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene plant in germany by 13 to 10000 tons per year in the third calendar quarter of 2004 and in 2004 we also increased our north american polyacetal capacity at our bishop facility by 20 to 102000 tons we expect to continue to benefit from our investments and capacity expansion that enable us to meet increases in global demand

maximize cash flow and reduce debt

despite a difficult operating environment over the past several years we have generated a significant amount of operating cash flow between january 1 2002 and march 31 2004 the predecessor generated over 650 million of net cash provided by operating activities between april 1 2004 and december 31 2004 the successor consumed over 63 million of net cash used in operating activities the cash flow used by operations was affected by the onetime payment of a 95 million obligation to a third party 59 million associated with the exercising of stock appreciation rights pension contributions totaling 409 million and higher interest expense due to increased debt levels we expect improvement in our operating cash flow through increased productivity in our operations increased cash dividends from our ventures reduced pension contributions and pursuing additional cost reduction efforts we believe in a focused capital expenditure plan that is dedicated to attractive investment projects we intend to use our free cash flow to reduce indebtedness and selectively expand our businesses the operating cash flow used by the predecessor for the three months ended march 31 2004 was 107 million as of december 31 2004 we had total debt of 3387 million and cash and cash equivalents of 838 million

deliver valueadded solutions

we continually develop new products and industry leading production technologies that solve our customers problems for example ticona has worked closely with fuel system suppliers to develop an acetal copolymer with the chemical and impact resistance necessary to withstand exposure to hot diesel fuels in our emulsions business we pioneered a technological solution that leads the industry in product offerings for ecologically friendly emulsions for solventfree interior paints we believe that our customers value our expertise and we will continue to work with them to enhance the quality of their products

enhance value of portfolio

we will continue to further optimize our business portfolio through divestitures acquisitions and strategic investments that enable us to focus on businesses in which we can achieve market cost and technology leadership over the long term in addition we intend to continue to expand our product mix into higher valueadded products for example we have begun construction of a 600000 metric ton acetic acid plant in china the worlds fastest growing market for acetic acid the plant is expected to come on 

stream in late 2006 or early 2007 we also divested noncore businesses such as acrylates which we sold to dow in february 2004 we also acquired vinamul polymers the north american and european emulsions business of imperial chemical industries plc in february 2005

net sales to external customers by destination—performance products

 

nutrinova directly markets sunett primarily to a limited number of large multinational and regional customers in the beverage and food industry under longterm and annual contracts nutrinova markets food protection ingredients primarily through regional distributors to small and medium sized customers and directly through regional sales offices to large multinational customers in the food industry

competition 

the principal competitors for nutrinovas sunett sweetener are holland sweetener company the nutrasweet company ajinomoto co inc and several chinese manufacturers in sorbates nutrinova competes with nantong aa daicel yu yaoningbo yancheng ameripac and other chinese manufacturers of sorbates

other activities

other activities included revenues mainly from the captive insurance companies celanese advanced materials inc and pemeas gmbh or pemeas celanese advanced materials consists of high performance polymer pbi and the vectran polymer fiber product lines pemeas a venture with a consortium of investors led by conduit ventures a london based venture capital company develops high temperature membrane assemblies or meas for fuel cells we contributed our mea activity to pemeas in april 2004 in december 2004 we approved a plan to dispose of our interest in pemeas other activities also include corporate activities several service companies and other ancillary businesses which do not have significant sales

our two whollyowned captive insurance companies are a key component of our global risk management program as well as a form of self insurance for our property liability and workers compensation risks the captive insurance companies issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the insurance market and to lower longterm insurance costs by avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees the captive insurance companies issue insurance policies and coordinate claims handling services with third party service providers they retain risk at levels approved by the celanese board of directors and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained one of the captive insurance companies also insures certain third party risks

investments

we have a significant portfolio of strategic investments including a number of ventures in asia north america and europe in aggregate these strategic investments enjoy significant sales earnings and cash flow we have entered into these strategic investments in order to gain access to local markets minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential the table below sets forth the earnings cash flow contribution and depreciation and amortization of our strategic investments

 

 

the fiscal year end for all ventures is december 31 depreciation and amortization as presented in the table above represents the amounts recorded by the ventures based on local generally accepted accounting principles computed in proportion to our ownership percentage these amounts are not included in the depreciation and amortization reported by the successor and the predecessor

 

the following are our principal ventures

major equity investments

polyplastics co ltd polyplastics co ltd polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineering plastics in the asiapacific region established in 1964 and headquartered in japan polyplastics is a 4555 venture between us and daicel chemical industries ltd polyplastics principal production facilities are located in japan taiwan and malaysia with an additional venture facility under construction in china we believe polyplastics is the largest producer and marketer of pom in the asiapacific region

korea engineering plastics co ltd  founded in 1987 korea engineering plastics co ltd kepco is the leading producer of pom in south korea we acquired our 50 interest in kepco in 1999 from the hyosung corporation a korean conglomerate mitsubishi gas chemical company owns the remaining 50 of kepco kepco operates a 55000ton annual capacity polyacetal products plant in ulsan south korea

fortron industries  fortron industries is a 5050 venture between us and kureha chemical industry co ltd kci of japan production facilities are located in wilmington nc we believe fortron has the leading technology in linear polymer

european oxo  in october 2003 we entered into a 5050 venture for european oxo operations with degussa ag under the terms of this venture we merged our commercial technical and operational propylenebased oxo business activities with those of degussa ags oxeno subsidiary european oxo has plants in oberhausen and marl germany

infraservs  we hold ownership interests in several infraserv groups located in germany infraservs own and develop industrial parks and provide onsite general and administrative support to tenants

major cost investments

china acetate products ventures  we hold approximately 30 ownership interests 50 board representation in three separate venture acetate products production entities in china the nantong kunming and zhuhai cellulose fiber companies in each instance chinese stateowned entities control the remainder the terms of these ventures were recently extended through 2020 with an estimated 30 share of the worlds cigarette production and consumption china is the worlds largest and fastest growing market for acetate tow products in combination these ventures represent the market leader in chinese domestic acetate production and are well positioned to capture future growth in the chinese cigarette market in march 2003 we and our partners decided to expand the manufacturing facilities at all three ventures in china the tow expansion at two of the ventures was completed in january 2005 the third is scheduled for completion in june 2005 flake expansion is expected to be completed in 2007 the ventures are funding the investments from operating cash flows

national methanol co ibn sina  with production facilities in saudi arabia national methanol co represents 2 of the worlds methanol production capacity and is the worlds eighth largest methanol producer of mtbe methanol and mtbe are key global commodity chemical products we indirectly own a 25 interest in national methanol co with the remainder held by the saudi basic industries corporation sabic 50 and texas eastern arabian corporation ltd 25 sabic has responsibility for all product marketing

these investments where celanese owns greater than a 20 percent ownership interest are accounted for under the cost method of accounting because celanese cannot exercise significant influence

acquisitions and divestitures

in the last three years we acquired the following businesses

  21

in the last three years we divested the following businesses

     for further information on the acquisition and divestitures discussed above see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

raw materials and energy

we purchase a variety of raw materials from sources in many countries for use in our production processes we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide and acetaldehyde in 2003 a primary us supplier of wood pulp to the acetate products segment shut down its pulp facility this closure resulted in increased operating costs for expenses associated with qualifying wood pulp from alternative suppliers and significant increases in wood pulp inventory levels we have secured alternative sources of wood pulp supply although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier nor can there be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of a sole supplier in addition the price of raw materials varies often substantially from year to year

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change for example the volatility of prices for natural gas and ethylene whose cost is in part linked to natural gas prices has increased in recent years our production facilities rely largely on coal fuel oil natural gas and electricity for energy most of the raw materials for our european operations are centrally purchased by our subsidiary which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties we manage our exposure through the use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging entering into longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements managements policy for the majority of its natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2004 there were no derivative contracts outstanding in 2003 there were forward contracts covering approximately 35 of the companys chemical products segment north american requirements management regularly assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity requirements forward and the utilization of a variety of other raw material hedging instruments in addition to forward purchase contracts in accordance with changes in market conditions management capped its exposure on approximately 20 of its us natural gas requirements during the months of august and september of 2004 the fixed price natural gas forward contracts and any premium associated with the purchase of a price cap are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap or cap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect or securing or limiting predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts were structured to limit exposure to increases in commodity prices certain swaps may also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap or cap contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges

research and development

all of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness our technical polymers ticona and performance products segments in particular are innovationoriented businesses that conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications

the chemical products segment has been focusing on improving core production technologies such as improving catalyst development and supporting both debottlenecking and cost reduction efforts

the acetate products segment has been concentrating on developing new applications for acetate tow such as its use in disposable consumer materials

research in the technical polymers ticona segment is focused on the development of new formulations and applications for its products improved manufacturing processes and new polymer materials with varying chemical and physical properties in order to meet customer needs and to generate growth this effort involves the entire value chain from new or improved monomer production polymerization and compounding to working closely with endusers to identify new applications that can take advantage of these high performance features ticona is continually improving compounding recipes to extend product properties and grades while offering grade consistency on a global basis in addition ticona is developing new polymerization and manufacturing technology in order to meet economic and ecological goals without sacrificing high quality processing

the research and development activities of the performance products segment are conducted at nutrinovas frankfurt germany location they are directed towards expanding its existing technologies and developing new applications for existing products in close cooperation with its customers

research and development costs are included in expenses as incurred the successors development costs for the nine months ended december 31 2004 were 67 million the predecessors research and development costs for the three months ended march 31 2004 and for 2003 and 2002 were 23 million 89 million and 65 million respectively for additional information on our research and development expenses see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—summary of consolidated results— 2003 compared with 2002—research and development expenses

intellectual property

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage

in most industrial countries patent protection exists for new substances and formulations as well as for unique applications and production processes however we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce we maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business such information security policies and procedures include data encryption controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information as well as employee awareness training moreover we monitor our competitors and vigorously challenge patent and trademark infringement for example the chemical products segment maintains a strict patent enforcement strategy which has resulted in favorable outcomes in a number of patent infringement matters in europe asia and the united states we are currently pursuing a number of matters relating to the infringement of our acetic acid patents some of our earlier acetic acid patents will expire in 2007 other patents covering acetic acid are presently pending

as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public our european and us patents for making sunett an important product in our performance products segment expire by the end of the first quarter of 2005 which will 

reduce our ability to realize revenues from making sunett due to increased competition and potential limitations and will result in our results of operations and cash flows relating to the product being less favorable than today we believe that the loss of no other single patent which may expire in the next several years will materially adversely affect our business or financial results

we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired we protect our trademarks vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate

environmental and other regulation

obtaining producing and distributing many of our products involves the use storage transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials we are subject to extensive evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and regulations which address among other things the following

      we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances at various sites under some of these laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on under or in its property without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred as many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of our sites and might occur or be discovered at other sites the predecessors worldwide expenditures for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the successors worldwide expenditures for the nine months ended december 31 2004 in each case including those with respect to third party and divested sites and those for compliance with environmental control regulations and internal company initiatives totaled 22 million of which 2 million was for capital projects and totaled 66 million of which 6 million was for capital projects respectively it is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures due to new air regulations in the us management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 30 million to 45 million through 2007 according to our estimates there may be an additional increase of approximately 50 million over the 30 to 45 million during that time depending on the outcome of the pending court challenge to the low risk alternative method of compliance allowed by recent air regulations for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters but thereafter management believes that the current spending trends will continue it is difficult to estimate the future costs of environmental protection and remediation because of many uncertainties including uncertainties about the status of laws regulations and information related to individual locations and sites subject to the foregoing but taking into consideration our experience to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known we believe that capital expenditures and remedial actions to comply with existing laws governing environmental protection will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

air issues

in december 1997 the conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change drafted the kyoto protocol which would establish significant emission reduction targets 

for six gases considered to have global warming potential referred to as greenhouse gases and would drive mandatory reductions in developed nations subject to the protocol with russias ratification in november 2004 the protocol has been adopted by enough of the larger industrialized countries defined in annex i to the protocol and came into effect in february 2005 in all nations that have ratified it the european union or eu including germany and other countries where the company has interests ratified the kyoto protocol in 2002 and is formulating applicable regulations recent european union regulations required all eu member states to have implemented a trading system covering carbon dioxide emissions by january 1 2005 accordingly an emission trading system came into effect at the start of 2005 the new regulation directly affects our power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites in germany and the lanaken site in belgium as well as the power plants being operated by other infraserv entities on sites at which we operate we and the infraserv entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits which could result in increased operating costs or may be required to develop additional costeffective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further which could result in increased capital expenditures we have not yet determined the impact of this legislation on future capital spending the new regulation indirectly affects our other operations in the eu which may experience higher energy costs from third party providers we have not yet determined the impact of this legislation on our operating costs

in 2002 president bush announced new climate change initiatives for the us among the policies to be pursued is a voluntary commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the us economy by 18 percent within the next ten years the bush administration is seeking to partner with various industrial sectors including the chemical industry to reach this goal the american chemistry council of which we are a member has committed to pursue additional reductions in greenhouse gas intensity toward an overall target of 18 percent by 2012 using 1990 emissions intensity as the baseline we currently emit carbon dioxide and smaller amounts of methane and experience some losses of polyfluorinated hydrocarbons used as refrigerants we have invested and continue to invest in improvements to our processes that increase energy efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas intensity

in some cases compliance with environmental health and safety requirements involves our incurring capital expenditures due to new air regulations in the united states management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 30 million to 45 million through 2007 for example the miscellaneous organic national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulations and various approaches to regulating boilers and incinerators including the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters will impose additional requirements on our operations although some of these rules have been finalized a significant portion of the neshap for industrialcommercialindustrial boilers and process heaters regulation that provides for a low risk alternative method of compliance for hydrogen chloride emissions has been challenged in federal court we cannot predict the outcome of this challenge which could if successful increase our costs by according to our estimates approximately 50 million in addition to the 30 million to 45 million noted above through 2007 to comply with this regulation

chemical products issues

other new or revised regulations may place additional requirements on the production handling labeling or use of some chemical products pursuant to a european union regulation on risk assessment of existing chemicals the european chemicals bureau of the european commission has been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals some of the chemicals initially being evaluated include vinyl acetate monomer or vam which cag produces as well as competitors products such as styrene and 13butadiene these risk assessments entail a multistage process to determine whether and to what extent the commission should classify the chemical as a carcinogen and if so whether this classification and related labeling requirements should apply only to finished products that contain specified threshold concentrations of a particular chemical in the case of vam we currently do not expect a final ruling until the end of the first half of 2005 we and other vam producers are participating in this process with detailed scientific analyses supporting the industrys position that vam is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling of end products should not be required but that if 

it is should only be at relatively high parts per million of residual vam levels in the end products it is not possible for us to predict the outcome or effect of any final ruling

several recent studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various medical conditions including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer or iarc recently reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans iarc also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde although it also characterized evidence for such an association as strong the results of iarcs review will be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements

we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde we together with other producers and users are evaluating these findings we cannot predict the final effect of iarcs reclassification

other recent initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the new european environment and health strategy commonly known as scale and the proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach reach which was proposed by the european commission in october 2003 will establish a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured or imported to the european union depending on the final ruling additional testing documentation and risk assessments will occur for the chemical industry this will affect european producers of chemicals as well as all chemical companies worldwide that export to member states of the european union the final ruling has not yet been decided

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could adversely affect the demand for these products

remediation issues

we are subject to claims brought by united states federal or state regulatory agencies regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions or private individuals regarding the cleanup of sites that we own or operate owned or operated or where waste or other material from its operations was disposed treated or recycled in particular we have a potential liability under the united states federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended commonly known as superfund the united states resource conservation and recovery act and related state laws or regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions or through obligations retained by contractual agreements for investigation and cleanup costs at many of these sites numerous companies including us or one of our predecessor companies have been notified that the environmental protection agency or epa state governing body or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties under superfund or related laws the proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages the cleanup process has not been completed at most sites we regularly review the liabilities for these sites and accrue our best estimate of our ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs but due to the many variables involved in such estimation the ultimate liability may vary from these estimates

our whollyowned subsidiary infraserv verwaltungs gmbh is the general partner of the infraserv companies that provide onsite general and administrative services at german sites in frankfurt am mainhoechst gendorf huerthknapsack wiesbaden oberhausen and kelsterbach producers at the sites including our subsidiaries are owners of limited partnership interests in the respective infraserv companies the infraserv companies are liable for any residual contamination and other pollution because they own the real estate on which the individual facilities operate in addition hoechst as the responsible party under german public law is liable to third parties for all environmental damage that 

occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and real estate however the infraserv companies have agreed to indemnify hoechst from any environmental liability arising out of or in connection with environmental pollution of any infraserv site the partnership agreements provide that as between the limited partners each limited partner is responsible for any contamination caused predominantly by such partner the limited partners have also undertaken to indemnify hoechst against such liabilities any liability that cannot be attributed to an infraserv partner and for which no third party is responsible is required to be borne by the infraserv company in question in view of this potential obligation to eliminate residual contamination the infraserv companies in which we have an interest have recorded provisions totaling approximately 81 million as of december 31 2004 if the infraserv companies default on their respective indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination the limited partners in the infraserv companies have agreed to fund such liabilities subject to a number of limitations to the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the infraserv companies or the limited partners these liabilities are to be borne by us in accordance with the demerger agreement

as between hoechst and cag hoechst has agreed to indemnify cag for twothirds of these demerged residual liabilities likewise in some circumstances cag could be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on a few sites that were not transferred to infraserv companies in which case hoechst must reimburse cag for twothirds of any costs so incurred

some of our facilities in germany are over 100 years old and there may be significant contamination at these facilities provisions are not recorded for potential soil contamination liability at facilities still under operation as german law does not currently require owners or operators to investigate and remedy soil contamination until the facility is closed and dismantled unless the authorities otherwise direct however soil contamination known to the owner or operator must be remedied if such contamination is likely to have an adverse effect on the public if we were to terminate operations at one of our facilities or if german law were changed to require such removal or clean up the cost could be material to us we cannot accurately determine the ultimate potential liability for investigation and clean up at such sites we adjust provisions as new remedial commitments are made see notes 4 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements

in the demerger agreement between hoechst and cag cag agreed to indemnify hoechst against environmental liabilities for environmental contamination that could arise under some divestiture agreements regarding chemical businesses participations or assets located in germany the us and other countries that were entered into by hoechst prior to the demerger cag and hoechst have agreed that cag will indemnify hoechst against those liabilities up to an amount of €250 million approximately 340 million hoechst will bear those liabilities exceeding €250 million approximately 340 million but cag will reimburse hoechst for onethird of those liabilities for amounts that exceed €750 million approximately 1022 million cag has made payments through december 31 2004 of 38 million for environmental contamination liabilities in connection with the divestiture agreements as of december 31 2004 cag has reserves of 46 million for this contingency and may be required to record additional reserves in the future see notes 19 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements

at december 31 2004 the estimated range for remediation costs is between 100 million and 143 million with the best estimate of 143 million future findings or changes in estimates could have a material effect on the recorded reserves and celaneses cash flows as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 we had reserves of 143 million and 159 million respectively for environmental matters worldwide we regularly review the liabilities for these sites and have accrued our best estimate of an ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs but due to many variables involved in such estimation the ultimate liability may vary from these estimates

organizational structure

significant subsidiaries

we operate our global businesses through subsidiaries in europe north america and asia all of which are owned indirectly through a series of holding companies our european and asian subsidiaries including celanese chemicals europe gmbh ticona gmbh nutrinova nutrition specialties  food 

ingredients gmbh and celanese singapore pte ltd are owned indirectly by cag in north america many of the businesses are consolidated under cac which through its whollyowned subsidiary cna holdings inc directly or indirectly owns the north american operating companies these include celanese ltd ticona polymers inc celanese acetate llc and grupo celanese sa

employees

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 9100 employees worldwide from continuing operations compared to 9500 as of december 31 2003 this represents a decrease of approximately 4 percent the following table sets forth the approximate number of employees on a continuing basis as of december 31 2004 2003 and 2002

 

many of our employees are unionized particularly in germany canada mexico brazil belgium and france however in the united states less than one quarter of our employees are unionized moreover in germany and france wages and general working conditions are often the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements within the limits established by these agreements our various subsidiaries negotiate directly with the unions and other labor organizations such as workers councils representing the employees collective bargaining agreements between the german chemical employers associations and unions relating to remuneration typically have a term of one year while in the united states a three year term for collective bargaining agreements is typical we offer comprehensive benefit plans for employees and their families and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory










 item 2 properties 

description of property

as of december 31 2004 we had numerous production and manufacturing facilities throughout the world we also own or lease other properties including office buildings warehouses pipelines research and development facilities and sales offices the following table sets forth a list of our principal production and other facilities throughout the world as of december 31 2004

 

 

 

  polyplastics has its principal production facilities in japan taiwan and malaysia korea engineering plastics has its principal production facilities in south korea our chemical products segment has ventures with manufacturing facilities in saudi arabia and germany and its acetate products segment has three ventures with production facilities in china

during the nine months ended december 31 2004 the successor and its consolidated subsidiaries in the aggregate had capital expenditures for the expansion and modernization of production manufacturing research and administrative facilities of 166 million during the three months ended march 31 2004 the predecessor and its consolidated subsidiaries in the aggregate had capital expenditures for the expansion and modernization of production manufacturing research and administrative facilities of 44 million in 2003 and 2002 these expenditures amounted to 211 million and 203 million respectively we believe that our current facilities and those of our consolidated subsidiaries are adequate to meet the requirements of our present and foreseeable future operations we continue to review our capacity requirements as part of our strategy to maximize our global manufacturing efficiency

for information on environmental issues associated with our properties see business—environmental and other regulation and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—environmental matters additional information with respect to our property plant and equipment and leases is contained in notes 12 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business relating to such matters as product liability antitrust past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment while it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings lawsuits and claims management believes that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see also note 27 to the consolidated financial statements

plumbing actions

cna holdings inc cna holdings a us subsidiary of celanese included the us business now conducted by the ticona segment cna holdings along with shell oil company shell dupont and others have been the defendants in a series of lawsuits including a number of class actions alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail based on among other things the findings of outside experts and the successful use of ticonas acetal copolymer in similar applications cna holdings does not believe ticonas acetal copolymer was defective or caused the plumbing systems to fail in many cases cna holdings exposure may be limited by invocation of the statute of limitations since cna holdings ceased selling the resin for use in the plumbing systems in site built homes during 1986 and in manufactured homes during 1990

cna holdings has been named a defendant in ten putative class actions further described below as well as a defendant in other nonclass actions filed in ten states the us virgin islands and canada in these actions the plaintiffs typically have sought recovery for alleged property damages and in some cases additional damages under the texas deceptive trade practices act or similar type statutes damage amounts have not been specified

developments under these matters are as follows

    32

    in order to reduce litigation expenses and to provide relief to qualifying homeowners in november 1995 cna holdings dupont and shell oil company entered into national class action settlements which have been approved by the courts the settlements call for the replacement of plumbing systems of claimants who have had qualifying leaks as well as reimbursements for certain leak damage furthermore the three companies have agreed to fund these replacements and reimbursements up to 950 million as of december 31 2004 the funding is 1073 million due to additional contributions and funding commitments made primarily by other parties there are additional pending lawsuits in approximately 5 jurisdictions not covered by this settlement however these cases do not involve either individually or in the aggregate a large number of homes and management does not expect the obligations arising from these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on the company

in 1995 cna holdings and shell oil company settled the claims relating to individuals in texas owning a total of 110000 property units who are represented by a texas law firm for an amount that will not exceed 170 million these claimants are also eligible for a replumb of their homes in accordance with terms similar to those of the national class action settlement cna holdings and shell oil companys contributions under this settlement were subject to allocation as determined by binding arbitration

in addition a lawsuit filed in november 1989 in delaware chancery court between cna holdings and various of its insurance companies relating to all claims incurred and to be incurred for the product liability exposure led to a partial declaratory judgment in cna holdings favor as a result settlements have been reached with a majority of cna holdings insurers specifying their responsibility for these claims however in january 2000 cna holdings filed a motion in superior state court in wilmington delaware to set a trial date with respect to this lawsuit against one insurer asserting that the settlement is void because the insurer refused to make the required coverage in place payments to cna holdings the insurer and cna holdings signed a settlement agreement in june 2003 pursuant to the settlement agreement the insurer agreed to pay cna holdings 105 million in five annual installments in satisfaction of all claims incurred and to be incurred for the product liability expense previously covered by the insurer in february 2005 cna holdings reached a settlement agreement with another insurer pursuant to which the insurer agreed to pay cna holdings 44 million in exchange for the release of certain claims this amount was recorded as a reduction of goodwill

management believes that the plumbing actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements and that they will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

however if we were to incur an additional charge for this matter such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period no assurance can be given that our litigation reserves will be adequate or that we will fully recover claims under our insurance policies

sorbates antitrust actions

in 1998 nutrinova inc a us subsidiary of nutrinova nutrition specialties  food ingredients gmbh then a whollyowned subsidiary of hoechst received a grand jury subpoena from the united states district court for the northern district of california in connection with a criminal antitrust investigation of the sorbates industry on may 3 1999 hoechst and the us federal government entered into an agreement under which hoechst pled guilty to a onecount indictment charging hoechst with participating in a conspiracy to fix prices and allocate market shares of sorbates sold in the united states hoechst and the us federal government agreed to recommend that the us district court fine hoechst 36 million payable over five years with the last payment of 5 million being paid in june 2004 hoechst also agreed to cooperate with the us federal investigation and prosecutions related to the sorbates industry the us district court accepted this plea on june 18 1999 and imposed a penalty as recommended in the plea agreement

nutrinova and hoechst have cooperated with the european commission since 1998 in connection with matters relating to the sorbates industry in may 2002 the european commission informed hoechst of its intent to investigate officially the sorbates industry and in early january 2003 the european commission served hoechst nutrinova and a number of competitors with a statement of objections alleging unlawful anticompetitive behavior affecting the european sorbates market in october 2003 the european commission ruled that hoechst chisso corporation daicel chemical industries ltd the nippon synthetic chemical industry co ltd and ueno fine chemicals industry ltd operated a cartel in the european sorbates market between 1979 and 1996 the european commission imposed a total fine of €1384 million approximately 189 million of which €99 million approximately 135 million was assessed against hoechst the case against nutrinova was closed the fine against hoechst is based on the european commissions finding that hoechst does not qualify under the leniency policy is a repeat violator and together with daicel was a coconspirator in hoechsts favor the european commission gave a discount for cooperating in the investigation hoechst appealed the european commissions decision in december 2003 and that appeal is still pending

in addition several civil antitrust actions by sorbates customers seeking monetary damages and other relief for alleged conduct involving the sorbates industry have been filed in us state and federal courts naming hoechst nutrinova and our other subsidiaries as well as other sorbates manufacturers as defendants many of these actions have been settled and dismissed by the court one private action kerr v eastman chemical co et al  is still pending in the superior court of new jersey law division gloucester county the plaintiff alleges violations of the new jersey antitrust act and the new jersey consumer fraud act and seeks unspecified damages

in july 2001 hoechst and nutrinova entered into an agreement with the attorneys general of 33 states pursuant to which the statutes of limitations were tolled pending the states investigations this agreement expired in july 2003 since october 2002 the attorneys general for new york illinois ohio utah and idaho filed suit on behalf of indirect purchasers in their respective states the utah nevada and idaho actions have been dismissed as to hoechst nutrinova and cag a motion for reconsideration is pending in nevada an appeal filed in idaho was dismissed and that dismissal was upheld by the idaho supreme court the ohio and illinois actions have been settled and the idaho action was dismissed in february 2005 the new york action new york v daicel chemical industries ltd et al pending in the new york state supreme court new york county is the only attorney general action still pending it too seeks unspecified damages all antitrust claims in this matter were dismissed by the court in september 2004 however other state law claims are still pending hoechst and nutrinova have filed an appeal of the courts denial of the motion to dismiss those remaining claims a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of connecticut florida hawaii maryland south carolina oregon and washington is currently being negotiated and these attorneys general have been granted extensions of the tolling agreement

although the outcome of the foregoing proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that any resulting liabilities net of amounts recoverable from hoechst will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given period in the demerger agreement hoechst agreed to pay 80 percent of liabilities that may arise from the government investigation and the civil antitrust actions related to the sorbates industry

impact of the acquisition of celanese ag

on april 6 2004 celanese europe holding gmbh  co kg formerly known as bcp crystal acquisition gmbh  co kg bcp or the purchaser an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the successor acquired approximately 84 of the celanese ag ordinary shares excluding treasury shares cag shares the ordinary shares were acquired at a price of €3250 per share or an aggregate purchase price of 1693 million including direct acquisition costs of approximately 69 million during the nine months ended december 31 2004 the purchaser acquired additional cag shares for a purchase price of 33 million as the additional shares acquired primarily represented exercised employee stock options the purchasers ownership percentage remained at approximately 84 as of december 31 2004

as part of the acquisition the purchaser agreed to refinance certain existing debt of cag prefund pension obligations of cag prefund certain contingencies and certain obligations linked to the value of the cag such as the payment of fair cash compensation under a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement domination agreement for the remaining outstanding cag shares and payment obligations related to outstanding stock appreciation rights stock options and interest payments provide additional funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes and pay related fees and expenses

the funds used in connection with the acquisition of cag were provided by equity investments of 641 million from the blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 1 blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 2 and blackstone capital partners cayman ltd 3 collectively blackstone and ba capital investors sidecar fund lp and together with blackstone the original shareholders term loans of approximately 608 million borrowings under senior subordinated bridge loan facilities of 1565 million as well as the issuance of mandatorilly redeemable preferred stock totaling 200 million the senior subordinated bridge loan facilities have since been refinanced by the senior subordinated notes and the floating rate term loan as a result of the financing our interest expense currently is and will continue to be substantially higher than it was prior to the acquisition or as compared with historical cag

we accounted for the acquisition of cag using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly this resulted in a new basis of accounting the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are reflected at fair value for the approximately 84 portion acquired and at cag historical basis for the remaining approximate 16 the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired at closing was allocated to goodwill and this indefinite lived asset is subject to an annual impairment review goodwill in the transaction totalled 747 million

in connection with the acquisition of cag at the acquisition date the company began formulating a plan to exit or restructure certain activities we have not completed this analysis but have recorded initial liabilities of 60 million primarily for employee severance and related costs in connection with the preliminary plan as well as approving the continuation of all existing predecessor restructuring and exit plans as we finalize our plans to exit or restructure activities we may record additional liabilities for among other things severance and severance related costs which may also increase the goodwill recorded see note 2 in the consolidated financial statements

overview – nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003

all business segments experienced volume growth in the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period last year the chemical products segment benefited from stronger overall demand while the ticona segment grew on new commercial applications and stronger demand from the automotive electricalelectronics household goods and medical markets the performance of ticonas affiliates also reflected improved business conditions the overall economic environment however remained challenging due to higher raw material and energy costs as well as weaker pricing for some products in the ticona and performance products segments compared to the same period last year

net sales in the nine months ended december 31 2004 rose 10 to 3826 million compared to net sales for the same period in 2003 mainly on higher volumes in all business segments stronger pricing in chemical products and favorable currency effects which were partially offset by lower pricing in the remaining segments and changes in the composition of the chemical products segment

operating profit increased by 70 to 78 million compared to the same period last year operating profit benefited from increased net sales lower stock appreciation rights expense of 76 million as well as cost savings these factors were partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs higher special charges of 87 million expenses associated with a new management compensation plan of 50 million and higher professional and consulting fees for the nine months ended december 31 2004 operating profit included lower depreciation and amortization of 40 million resulting primarily from purchase accounting adjustments and a noncash charge of 53 million in inventoryrelated purchase accounting adjustments

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to a loss of 174 million from earnings of 108 million in the same period last year mainly due to an increase in interest expense of 263 million resulting from the higher debt levels and the expensing of deferred financing costs of 89 million and the absence of 18 million in income from the demutualization of an insurance provider which was partially offset by higher operating profit of 32 million

net earnings loss decreased to a loss of 253 million compared to earnings of 92 million for the same period a year earlier

net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents rose to 2549 million from 489 million as of december 31 2003 primarily to finance the acquisition of cag and to prefund benefit obligations

overview – three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003

in the three months ended march 31 2004 all of cags businesses experienced strong volume growth compared to the same period the previous year cag benefited from increased activity in some of its markets such as electricalelectronics new applications for technical polymers and food ingredients and tight supply conditions in the acetyl products markets operating profit declined however due to higher raw material and energy costs special charges and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights which were partially offset by favorable currency effects

net sales increased 9 to 1243 million due to volume increases and favorable currency effects resulting mainly from the stronger euro versus the us dollar volume increases were particularly strong in the acetate products and ticona segments these factors were partially offset by the effects of transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003

earnings from continuing operations were 55 million compared to 64 million in the comparable period in 2003 net earnings loss increased to 78 million from 56 million due to an increase in earnings of 30 million from discontinued operations resulting mainly from the sale of the acrylates business

overview – 2003 compared 2002

in a global business environment characterized by higher raw material and energy costs and modest growth cag achieved full year 2003 net earnings of 148 million compared to net earnings of 168 

million for 2002 earnings from continuing operations increased to 143 million in 2003 compared to 123 million in 2002 earnings from continuing operations excludes the results of the nylon and the majority of the acrylates businesses which were divested on december 31 2003 and february 1 2004 respectively and are included in earnings loss from discontinued operations net sales increased to 4603 million in 2003 from 3836 million in 2002 due to price and volume increases and favorable currency movements

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 196 million in 2003 compared to 180 million in 2002 this increase was primarily due to higher pricing particularly in the chemical products segment increased volumes in all segments cost reductions productivity improvements and favorable currency movements additional favorable adjustments included greater earnings from affiliates mainly in asia increased interest and income from plumbing insurance recoveries and the demutualization of an insurance provider as well as the addition of the emulsions business acquired at the end of 2002 also affecting earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests was income of 107 million from insurance recoveries and 95 million of expense associated with antitrust matters in the sorbates industry as discussed below these increases were mainly offset by higher costs for raw materials and energy and increased expense for stock appreciation rights

significant items affecting earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests from 2003 to 2002 were approximately

 

although cag recorded special charges of only 5 million special charges significantly affected the operating results of the ticona and performance products segments in 2003 ticonas operating profit benefited from income of 107 million from insurance recoveries related to the plumbing cases the insurance recoveries more than offset special charges related to ticonas organizational redesign efforts and the closing of a manufacturing facility in the united kingdom the operating profit of the performance products segment was burdened by 95 million in special charges relating to a european commission decision to fine hoechst €99 million 115 million for antitrust matters in the sorbates industry that occurred prior to the demerger

segment net sales in 2003 increased 21 compared to 2002 due to the inclusion of the emulsions business acquired at yearend 2002 8 favorable currency effects 5 and higher pricing 5 and volumes 4 these increases were partly offset by the transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003 −1 operating profit declined by 32 to 118 million in 2003 compared to 173 million in 2002 this decline reflected increased raw material and energy costs as well as higher expense for stock appreciation rights and special charges discussed below these factors outweighed increased pricing in the chemical products and acetate products segments higher volumes in all segments particularly in ticona and performance products cost reductions productivity improvements increased income from the captive insurance companies and the addition of the emulsions business

in the chemical products segment the contribution from the emulsions business favorable currency movements and cost reductions were outweighed by higher energy costs and an increase in stock appreciation rights expense overall in 2003 increased selling prices offset higher raw material costs although pricing outpaced raw material costs in the first half of the year and lagged in the second half in the acetate products segment increased pricing and volumes as well as productivity gains only partially offset higher raw material and energy prices increased demand led to volume improvements in the ticona segment on the development of new applications and entry into new markets partially offset by organizational redesign costs volume increases for the performance products sunett sweetener were offset by lower pricing for sunett and sorbates

cag reduced its net debt by 6 to 489 million as of december 31 2003 compared to 520 million as of december 31 2002 this decrease primarily represents the net repayment of 68 million of debt offset by the addition of 38 million of debt related to the consolidation of a variable interest entity under financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities  trade working capital increased to 641 million at december 31 2003 from 599 million at december 31 2002 this increase is primarily related to favorable foreign currency effects as lower payables more than offset the reduction in inventory resulting from the high levels at the end of 2002 resulting from advance purchases of wood pulp a key raw material in the acetate products segment caused by the shutdown of a major supplier operating cash flow benefited by 180 million relating to the effects of hedging of currency exposure on intercompany funding of operations in us dollars compared to approximately 95 million in 2002 benefit obligations decreased by 106 million to 1165 million in 2003 from 1271 million primarily due to an increase in the fair value of plan assets contributions payments and a plan amendment related to the us postretirement medical plan these factors were partially offset by the effects of a decrease in the discount rate

in 2003 cag took major steps to concentrate on its core businesses in september cag reached an agreement to sell its acrylates business to dow the transaction was completed on february 1 2004 on october 1 european oxo gmbh cags oxo chemicals venture with degussa began operations

cag streamlined its manufacturing operations and administrative functions mainly in the chemical products and ticona segments and as a result recorded termination benefit expenses of 26 million in cost of sales primarily in the fourth quarter of 2003

summary by business segment—nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 and three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003

chemical products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

chemical products net sales increased by 12 to 2573 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from the comparable period last year as higher selling prices 10 increased volumes 4 and favorable currency movements 4 were partially offset by changes in the composition of the segment 6

pricing increased for most products particularly vinyl acetate monomer acetic acid and acetyl derivative products driven by high industry utilization and higher costs for raw materials volumes also increased particularly for vinyl acetate monomer polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions due to strong overall demand

the changes in the composition of the segment result from the transfer of the european oxo business into a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003 2 and a change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates products which were formerly sold into the merchant market are now being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement 4 only the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net sales

operating profit increased to 248 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from 86 million in the same period last year higher pricing higher volumes as well as favorable currency effects were partially offset by increased raw material costs and energy operating profit was also favorably impacted by lower stock appreciation rights expense of 18 million and the absence of a loss from the european oxo business as well as decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 30 million largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 17 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 265 million compared to 115 million for the nine months ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher operating profit which was partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and lower equity in net earnings of affiliates due to restructuring charges in the european oxo venture

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

chemical products net sales increased by 7 to 818 million in the three months ended march 31 2004 from the comparable period last year as increased volumes 5 favorable currency movements 

5 and higher selling prices 2 were partially offset by the effects of the transfer of the european oxo business into a venture 4 as well as a change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates products which were formerly sold into the merchant market are now being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement 1 only the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net sales

volumes and pricing for most acetyl products particularly vinyl acetate monomer increased in most regions due to a temporary competitor outage and stronger overall demand

operating profit increased to 65 million in the three months ended march 31 2004 from 52 million in the same period last year higher volumes and selling prices as well as favorable currency effects were partially offset by increased raw material costs and spending associated with productivity initiatives increased energy costs the transfer of the european oxo business and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights of 4 million

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 64 million compared to 60 million in the three months ended march 31 2004 primarily due to a higher operating profit partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and our share of the loss generated from the european oxo venture

technical polymers ticona 

 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

net sales for ticona increased by 12 to 636 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period last year strong volume increases 11 and favorable currency effects 5 were partly offset by a decline in pricing 4

volumes grew in all product lines particularly in core products polyacetal volumes grew on stronger sales in the automotive and medical industries in north america while european sales benefited from greater demand for uses in consumer products and the commercialization of new applications volumes for vectra liquid crystal polymers rose in north america and europe due to new commercial applications such as household goods and stronger sales to the electricalelectronics industry gur ultra high molecular weight polyethylene grew as a result of increased sales for new specialty applications and stronger sales to asia overall pricing declined due to changes in product mix and ongoing competitive pressure from asian exports of polyacetal into north america and europe

ticona recorded special charges of 37 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to income from special charges of 87 million for the same period last year the special charges 

in 2004 are mainly related to a 32 million noncash impairment charge associated with a plan to dispose of the cycloolefin copolymer business income from special charges in 2003 consisted of insurance recoveries related to the plumbing cases of 107 million which were partially offset by 20 million in organizational redesign costs

operating profit decreased to a loss of 12 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from an operating profit of 103 million for the same period last year due to the impact of changes in special charges mentioned above results for the nine months ended december 31 2004 benefited from higher volumes lower stock appreciation rights expense of 17 million and productivity improvements these factors were partly offset by higher raw material and energy costs operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 20 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to 26 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 from 140 million for the same period in 2003 this decrease resulted primarily from the changes in operating profit and lower interest income related to insurance recoveries which was partly offset by improved equity earnings from asian and us affiliates due to increased sales volumes

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

net sales for ticona increased by 16 to 227 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 compared to the same period last year as higher volumes 13 and favorable currency movements 8 was partially offset by lower selling prices 5

volumes increased in most business lines particularly in polyacetal and vectra liquid crystal polymers polyacetal volumes grew in north america and europe on sales to new end uses and higher sales to the north american automotive market volumes for vectra rose due to new commercial applications in north america and europe and stronger sales to the electricalelectronics industry pricing declined as lower priced products constituted a higher percentage of sales and competitive pressure continued from asian imports of polyacetal into north america

operating profit increased to 31 million versus 19 million in the same period last year due to higher volumes lower average production costs for vectra reduced spending partly resulting from the closure of the telford uk production facility in 2003 and favorable currency movements these increases were partially offset by lower pricing as well as the absence of 5 million of income from stock appreciation rights

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 45 million compared to 27 million in the same period in 2003 this increase resulted from the higher operating profit and improved equity earnings from our polyplastics and fortron industries affiliates due to increased sales volumes

acetate products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

acetate products net sales for the nine months ended december 31 2004 increased by 2 to 523 million compared to the same period last year due to slightly higher volumes 1 and prices 1

volumes grew on higher tow demand in asia which was partially offset by lower filament sales primarily in mexico additionally pricing increased for both tow and filament

operating profit declined to a loss of 11 million in the nine months ended december 31 2004 from an operating profit of 11 million in the same period last year reflecting special charges of 50 million for noncash asset impairments associated with the planned consolidation of tow production and our planned exit from the filament business as well as higher raw material costs these decreases were partly offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense of 20 million largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments and a lower depreciable asset base as well as from productivity gains operating loss in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 4 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

acetate products net sales in the first three months ended march 31 2004 increased by 21 to 172 million compared to the same period in 2003 primarily due to higher volumes 21 average pricing remained unchanged

volumes grew on higher sales of tow particularly to china this increase more than offset slightly lower filament volumes primarily in mexico

operating profit and earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests rose to 9 million compared to 2 million in the same period last year on higher volumes of tow as well as productivity gains these increases more than offset higher raw material costs

performance products 

 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

net sales for the performance products segment which consists primarily of the nutrinova food ingredients business increased by 2 to 131 million compared to the same period last year as increased volumes 14 and favorable currency effects 4 more than offset price decreases 16

increased volumes for sunett sweetener reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets consistent with our strategy pricing for sunett declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers and the anticipated expiration of the primary european and us production patents at the end of march 2005 pricing for sorbates which had been under pressure from asian producers began to stabilize although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the industry

operating profit increased to 18 million compared to loss of 56 million in the same period last year which included special charges of 95 million related to antitrust matters in the sorbates industry operating profit in the nine months ended december 31 2004 included a 12 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold and higher depreciation and amortization expense of 5 million largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003 

net sales for the performance products segment increased by 7 to 44 million primarily due to favorable currency effects 15 and increased volumes 7 these positive factors were largely offset by price decreases 15

pricing for sunett sweetener declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers an overall price decline in the high intensity sweetener market and the anticipated expiration of the european and us production patents at the end of march 2005 increased sunett volumes reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets in sorbates pricing and volume pressure from asian producers continued due to worldwide overcapacity

operating profit and earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests declined to 11 million compared to 12 million in the same period last year primarily due to lower pricing higher sunett volumes and currency movements partly offset this decline

other activities 

other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs including financing and certain administrative activities and certain other operating entities including the captive insurance companies 

nine months ended december 31 2004 compared with nine months ended december 31 2003 

net sales for other activities increased by 18 to 45 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period last year this increase primarily reflects higher third party revenues by the captive insurance companies

the operating loss of other activities increased to 165 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to 98 million for the same period last year this increase was primarily due to 38 million in new management incentive compensation expenses which includes charges related to a new a deferred compensation plan a new stock incentive plan and other executive bonuses as well as higher consulting and professional fees which includes the advisor monitoring fees of 10 million the operating loss for the nine months ended december 31 2003 included income resulting from the reversal of environmental reserves of 12 million which was offset by expense associated with stock appreciation rights of 34 million

loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 473 million from a loss of 106 million for the same period last year this was largely due to 259 million of higher interest expense from significantly higher costs of 89 million from the refinancing of debt and increased debt levels a higher operating loss and the absence of income from the demutualization of an insurance provider of 18 million

three months ended march 31 2004 compared with three months ended march 31 2003

the operating loss of other activities increased to 64 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 compared to 13 million for the same period last year this increase was primarily due to special charges of 26 million mainly related to advisory services associated with the acquisition of cag also contributing to this decline was the absence of income from stock appreciation rights of 7 million

selected data by business segment  annual results

 

summary by business segment – 2003 compared with 2002

chemical products

 

net sales of chemical products rose 27 to 3065 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the full year effect of the emulsions business acquired at yearend 2002 12 higher selling prices 9 favorable currency effects 5 as well as increased volumes 2 these increases were partly offset by the transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of 2003 1

compared to 2002 selling prices in 2003 increased for major products including acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer following the substantial rise in raw material costs particularly natural gas ethylene and propylene volumes rose for acetic acid particularly in asia as volumes were comparably higher due in part to an interruption in production in 2002 vinyl acetate monomer volumes were higher in most regions partly due to competitor outages while volumes declined for polyvinyl alcohol in asia and specialties mainly in europe due to competitive pricing

chemical products had income from special charges of 1 million in 2003 and 2 million in 2002 the income recorded in 2003 and 2002 relate to favorable adjustments to previously recorded restructuring reserves that more than offset employee severance costs related to production facility closures

operating profit decreased to 138 million in 2003 from 152 million in 2002 the contribution from the emulsions business favorable currency movements and cost reductions were outweighed by higher energy costs and an increase in stock appreciation rights expense of 13 million termination benefit expenses of 14 million were recorded in cost of sales primarily in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the streamlining of manufacturing operations and administrative functions overall in 2003 increased selling prices offset higher raw material costs although pricing outpaced raw material costs in the first half of the year and lagged in the second half

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 175 million in 2003 compared to 161 million in 2002 this increase resulted from higher dividend income from the saudi arabian cost investment primarily due to higher methanol pricing partially offset by lower operating profit

technical polymers ticona

 

net sales for ticona increased by 16 to 762 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 as higher volumes 11 and favorable currency movements 8 were partly offset by lower selling prices 3

volumes increased in most business lines particularly in polyacetal and gur ultra high molecular weight polyethylene the global volume growth in polyacetals resulted from sales to new customers and new enduses volumes for gur increased as the result of the commercialization of new applications in north america and europe as well as the exit of a major competitor in north america pricing declined on a higher percentage of sales from lower priced products and increased competitive pressure from asian imports of polyacetal into north america

ticona recorded income from special charges of 87 million in 2003 compared to expense of 6 million in 2002 the income in 2003 primarily resulted from insurance recoveries of 107 million associated with the plumbing cases which was partially offset by restructuring charges for organizational redesign costs of 12 million and the closure of the telford uk compounding facility of 8 million the 2002 expense resulted from restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in europe and the united states

operating profit increased to 122 million in 2003 versus 23 million in 2002 income from insurance recoveries higher volumes and reduced spending more than offset higher raw material and energy costs lower pricing and higher expense associated with stock appreciation rights of 13 million ticona continued to incur significant market development costs for cycloolefin copolymers in 2003 termination benefit expenses of 9 million were recorded in cost of sales primarily in the fourth quarter 2003 related to the streamlining of manufacturing operations and administrative functions

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to 167 million in 2003 compared to 35 million in 2002 this increase resulted from higher operating profit and higher equity earnings from the polyplastics venture due to growth in the chinese and taiwanese economies in 2003 as well as interest income from insurance recoveries

acetate products

 

net sales for the acetate products segment increased by 4 to 655 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 largely due to higher pricing 2 and higher volumes 2

average pricing rose in 2003 as higher tow prices offset slightly lower filament prices volumes grew as higher demand for filament and flake more than offset slightly lower tow volumes primarily in europe and africa despite a longterm trend of declining global demand for filament volumes improved mainly due to higher demand from the us fashion industry volumes of acetate flake a primary raw material in acetate filament and tow production also increased due to higher opportunistic sales in the merchant market

acetate products recorded an operating profit of 13 million in 2003 compared to 31 million in 2002 as higher pricing and volumes as well as productivity gains only partially offset higher raw material and energy prices the segment also incurred costs for transitioning to new wood pulp suppliers as a primary supplier closed its us facility in 2003 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the acetate products segment recorded a charge of 8 million included within depreciation expense as the result of a worldwide assessment of our acetate production capacity that assessment concluded that it was probable that certain facilities would be closed in the latter half of the decade

earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests declined to 17 million in 2003 compared to 43 million in 2002 this decline resulted from lower operating profit and lower dividend income from cost investments in china where earnings are being reinvested for capacity expansions

performance products

 

net sales for the performance products segment increased by 12 to 169 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to favorable currency movements 17 and increased volumes 6 partially offset by price decreases 11

pricing for sunett sweetener declined primarily as a result of lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers and the anticipated expiration of the european and us production patents in 2005 increased sunett volumes reflected strong growth from new applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets in sorbates pricing and volume pressure from asian producers intensified during 2003 due to worldwide overcapacity

performance products recorded special charges of 95 million in 2003 related to a decision by the european commission on antitrust matters in the sorbates industry

operating profit and earnings loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests declined from 45 million in 2002 to a loss of 44 million in 2003 due to special charges and lower pricing this decline was slightly offset by favorable currency movements higher sunett volumes cost reductions and increased productivity

other activities 

net sales for other activities decreased by 6 to 49 million in 2003 from 52 million in 2002 primarily reflecting slightly lower third party sales by the captive insurance companies

other activities recorded 2 million of income in special charges in 2003 compared to 9 million of income in 2002 the 2 million represented higher than expected collections of a note receivable the 9 million of income in 2002 related to a reduction in environmental reserves due to a settlement of obligations associated with former hoechst entities

the operating loss of other activities increased to 111 million in 2003 compared to 78 million in 2002 this increase was primarily the result of higher expense for stock appreciation rights of 27 million and lower income from special charges offset by 17 million of increased income from the captive insurance companies mainly due to a reduction in loss reserves resulting from expired policies and actuarial revaluations

earnings loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to a loss of 119 million in 2003 compared to a loss of 104 million in 2002 this decline resulted from higher operating losses partially offset by lower interest expense and higher interest and other income net lower interest expense is primarily due to lower interest rates and currency translation effects as well as lower average debt levels higher interest and other income net resulted primarily from income of 18 million from the demutualization of an insurance provider and the gain on sale of investments of 4 million partially offset by expense of 14 million related to the unfavorable currency effects on the unhedged position of intercompany net receivables denominated in us dollars

 net sales

for the nine months ended december 31 2004 net sales increased by 10 to 3826 million compared to the same period in 2003 volume increases in all segments higher pricing in the chemical products segment and favorable currency effects resulting mainly from the stronger euro versus the us dollar were partially offset by lower pricing in the remaining segments and the effects of reductions due to changes in the composition of the chemical products

cost of sales

cost of sales increased by 144 million to 3092 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 versus the comparable period last year higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency effects were partially offset by decreases due to changes in the composition of our chemical products segment and cost savings cost of sales for the nine months ended december 31 2004 also included a 53 million noncash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold offset by lower depreciation expense largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments

selling general and administrative expenses

selling general and administrative expense increased by 96 million to 498 million for nine months ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period last year this increase was primarily due to new management compensation expense of 50 million higher consulting and professional fees which includes advisor monitoring fees of 10 million increased amortization expense of identifiable intangible assets acquired as unfavorable currency movements as well as the absence of a favorable adjustment to our estimate of certain environmental reserves during the nine months ended december 31 2003 of 12 million which were partially offset by 69 million of lower stock appreciation rights expense

in january 2005 the company paid 10 million to affiliates of the blackstone group related to an advisor monitoring agreement this agreement was terminated concurrent with the initial public offering and resulted in an additional 35 million payment as such the company recorded expense of 45 million in the first quarter of 2005

special charges

special charges include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business operations as well as costs incurred in connection with decisions to exit nonstrategic businesses these measures are based on formal management decisions establishment of agreements with employees representatives or individual agreements with affected employees as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan the related reserves reflect certain estimates including those pertaining to separation costs settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under existing restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period actual experience may be different from these estimates

it is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on the chemical industry in general management cannot predict with certainty future environmental expenditures especially expenditures beyond 2005 due to new air regulations in the us management expects that 

there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 30 million to 45 million through 2007 an additional 50 million may be needed depending upon the outcome of a challenge in us federal court related to key portions of the regulation in addition a recent european union directive requires a trading system for carbon dioxide emissions to be in place by january 1 2005 accordingly emission trading systems will directly affect the power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites in germany and the lanaken site in belgium as well as power plants operated by infraserv entities on sites at which we operate the company and the infraserv entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits which could result in increased operating costs or may be required to develop additional costeffective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further which could result in increased capital expenditures additionally the new regulation indirectly affects our other operations in the european union which may experience higher energy costs from third party providers we have not yet determined the impact of this legislation on our operating costs

due to its industrial history the company has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its active sites as well as on divested orphan or us superfund sites in addition as part of the demerger agreement with hoechst a specified proportion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of predemerger divestitures was transferred to the company management has provided for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable management believes that the environmental costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company but they may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period see note 19 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements

market risks

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices the predecessor had in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below we adopted the predecessors written policies regarding the use of derivative financial instruments contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under sfas no 133 accounting 

for derivative instruments and hedging activities amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 148 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities  see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements

foreign exchange risk management

we and the predecessor have receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the various subsidiaries which create foreign exchange risk for the purposes of this document the predecessors reporting currency is the us dollar the reporting currency of celanese ag continues to be the euro the us dollar the euro mexican peso japanese yen british pound sterling and canadian dollar are the most significant sources of currency risk accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the foreign currency contracts are designated for recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions the terms of these contracts are generally under one year our centralized hedging strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables or liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be internally hedged only the remaining net foreign exchange position will then be hedged externally with banks as a result foreign currency forward contracts relating to this centralized strategy did not meet the criteria of sfas no 133 to qualify for hedge accounting net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized on the underlying transactions which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts

on june 16 2004 as part of its currency risk management the company entered into a currency swap with certain financial institutions under the terms of the swap arrangement the company will pay approximately €13 million in interest and receive approximately 16 million in interest on each june 15 and december 15 with interest for the first period prorated upon maturity of the swap agreement on june 16 2008 the company will pay approximately €276 million and receive approximately 333 million the company designated the swap the euro term loan and a euro note as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2004 the loss related to the swap was 21 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 of which 14 million is related to the ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge during the nine months ended december 31 2004 the effects of the swap resulted in an increase in total liabilities and a decrease in shareholders equity of 57 million and 36 million respectively

contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 288 million and 765 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively are predominantly in us dollars british pound sterling japanese yen and canadian dollars most of the companys foreign currency forward contracts did not meet the criteria of sfas no 133 to qualify for hedge accounting the company recognizes net foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the underlying transactions which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2004 the companys foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets and an increase in total liabilities of 42 million and 2 million respectively as of december 31 2004 these contracts in addition to natural hedges hedged approximately 100 of the companys net receivables held in currencies other than the entities functional currency for the companys european operations related to the unhedged portion during the year a net gain loss of approximately 2 million and 4 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense net for the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 during 2003 the predecessors foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets of 8 million and an increase in total liabilities of 1 million as of december 31 2003 these contracts hedged a portion approximately 85 of the predecessors us dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated entities related to the unhedged portion a net loss of approximately 14 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense net in 2003 during the year ended december 31 2002 the predecessor hedged all of its us dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated entities therefore there was no material net effect from foreign exchange gains or losses hedging activities primarily related to intercompany net receivables yielded cash flows from operating activities of approximately 17 million 180 million and 95 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

a substantial portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have and in the past have had a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect the company estimates that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 3 and increased total assets by approximately 3 for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the predecessor estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 6 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and by approximately 7 for the year ended december 31 2003 and by approximately 2 in 2002 the predecessor also estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar decreased total assets by approximately 1 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and approximately 5 in 2003 exposure to transactional effects is further reduced by a high degree of overlap between the currencies in which sales are denominated and the currencies in which the raw material and other costs of goods sold are denominated

as of december 31 2004 we had total debt of 3387 million of which approximately 610 million €447 million is euro denominated debt a 1 increase in foreign exchange rates would increase the euro denominated debt by 6 million

interest rate risk management

the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in the companys outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of fixedfloating rate debt depending on market conditions at december 31 2004 the successor had no interest rate swap agreements in place the predecessor had open interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 200 million at december 31 2003 in the second quarter of 2004 the successor recorded a loss of less than 1 million in other income expense net associated with the early termination of its 200 million interest rate swap during 2003 the predecessor recorded a loss of 7 million in other income expense net associated with the early termination of one of its interest rate swaps the successor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of 1 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the predecessor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of 2 million 11 million and 12 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 during 2003 the predecessors interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges resulted in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities and an increase in shareholders equity of 4 million 14 million and 7 million net of related income tax of 4 million respectively the predecessor recorded a net gain loss of less than 1 million 2 million and 3 million in other income expense net of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps during the three months ended march 31 2004 and the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

on a pro forma basis as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 1900 million of variable rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 19 million 

commodity risk management

the companys policy for the majority of our natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts fixed price natural gas forward contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract the successor recognized losses of less than 1 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the 

predecessor recognized losses of 1 million 3 million and less than 1 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively there was no material impact on the balance sheet at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 there were no unrealized gains and losses associated with the cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 the company did not have any open commodity swaps as of december 31 2004 the company had open swaps with a notional amount of 5 million as of december 31 2003

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements and application of these policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates however we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results

we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment these matters and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of the significant accounting policies

recoverability of longlived assets

our business is capital intensive and has required and will continue to require significant investments in property plant and equipment at december 31 2004 and 2003 the carrying amount of property plant and equipment was 1702 million and 1710 million respectively as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we and the predecessor assess the recoverability of property plant and equipment to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets

in december 2004 we approved a plan to dispose of the coc business included within the ticona segment this decision resulted in 32 million of asset impairment charges recorded as a special charge related to the coc business

as a result of the planned consolidation of tow production and the termination of filament production the acetate products segment recorded impairment charges of 50 million associated with plant and equipment in the nine months ended december 31 2004

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a twostep approach first the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a second step is performed wherein the reporting units assets and liabilities are fair valued the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the fair value of all nongoodwill assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit to the extent that the reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized as of december 31 2004 the company had 1147 million of goodwill and other intangible assets net

during 2003 the predecessor performed the annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment as a result of the tender offer price of €3250 per share announced on 

december 16 2003 which would place an implicit value on cag at an amount below book value of the net assets the predecessor initiated an impairment analysis in accordance with sfas no 142 the impairment analysis was prepared on a reporting unit level and utilized the most recent cash flow discount rate and growth rate assumptions based on the resulting analysis the predecessors management concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of december 31 2003

as of december 31 2004 no significant changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that drive the impairment analysis led management to believe goodwill might have been impaired we will continue to evaluate the need for impairment if changes in circumstances or available information indicate that impairment may have occurred in the future we expect to perform the required impairment tests at least annually on each june 30 unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing

a prolonged general economic downturn and specifically a continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure create an imbalance of industry supply and demand or otherwise diminish volumes or profits such events combined with changes in interest rates could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our longlived assets consequently it is possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of our longlived assets

restructuring and special charges

special charges include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a decision to exit nonstrategic businesses these measures are based on formal management decisions establishment of agreements with the employees representatives or individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan the related reserves reflect certain estimates including those pertaining to separation costs settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at the end of each reporting period actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements

environmental liabilities

we manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world accordingly the businesses operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use handling processing storage and transportation of hazardous materials we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated if the event of loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable but is reasonably possible the company provides appropriate disclosure in the notes to its consolidated financial statements if the contingency is material 

total reserves for environmental liabilities were 143 million and 159 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively measurement of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites an environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include for example provision for one or more of the following types of costs site investigation and testing costs cleanup costs costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and postremediation monitoring costs these reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance there are no pending insurance claims for any environmental liability that are expected to be material the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on a range of managements periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort we use our best estimate within the range to establish our environmental reserves we utilize third parties to assist in the management and the development of our cost estimates for our sites changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in 

which they occur we accrue for legal fees related to litigation matters when the costs associated with defense can be reasonably estimated and are probable to occur all other fees are expensed as incurred see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements

asset retirement obligations

total reserves for asset retirement obligations were 52 million and 47 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively sfas no 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred the liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded the corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the assets useful life management has identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to substantially all its existing operating facilities examples of these types of obligations include demolition decommissioning disposal and restoration activities legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations however operations at these facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time in the future we will assess strategies of the businesses acquired and may support decisions that differ from past decisions of management regarding the continuing operations of existing facilities asset retirement obligations will be recorded if these strategies are changed and probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities if certain operating facilities were to close the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows

in accordance with sfas no 143 the acetate products segment recorded a charge of 8 million included within 2003 depreciation expense related to potential asset retirement obligations as a result of a worldwide assessment of our acetate production capacity the assessment concluded that there was a probability that certain facilities would be closed in the latter half of the decade in october 2004 we announced plans to consolidate flake and tow production by early 2007 and to discontinue production of filament by mid2005 the restructuring will result in the discontinuance of acetate production at two sites as such we recorded a charge of 12 million included within depreciation expense of which 8 million was recorded by the acetate products segment and 4 million by the chemical products segment for the nine months ended december 31 2004

realization of deferred tax assets

total net deferred tax assets liabilities were 151 million and 555 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively management regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized such evaluations require significant management judgments valuation allowances have been established primarily for us federal and state net operating losses carryforwards certain german income tax loss carryforwards mexican net operating loss carryforwards and canadian deferred tax assets see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements

on april 6 2004 the closing date of the acquisition of cag the predecessor had approximately 576 million in net deferred tax assets of which 531 million were in the us including 172 million arising from us net operating loss nol carryforwards under us tax law the utilization of deferred tax assets related to nol carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation if there is a more than 50 percentage point change in shareholder ownership the acquisition of cag triggered this limitation as a result of this limitation and the restructuring 153 million of the 172 million nol was written off and a valuation allowance was established against the remaining 19 million in addition as a result of the restructuring including the transfer of cac to bcp crystal we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our other net us deferred tax assets accordingly we recorded a full valuation allowance on our 351 million of other net preacquisition us deferred tax assets reduced by deferred tax liabilities with a corresponding increase in goodwill in addition the valuation allowance 

on us deferred assets was increased by 33 million through a charge to tax expense during the nine months ended december 31 2004 related to activity subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition of cag

as a result of the conclusion of an income tax examination for the tax audit period ending december 31 2000 and the receipt of the final tax and interest assessment management reversed accrued income tax reserves attributable to that period this resulted in a decrease in income taxes payable and a decrease in goodwill of 113 million as it was a purchase accounting adjustment

benefit obligations

pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements are sponsored by cac with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan minimum funding requirements are determined by the employee retirement income security act for the periods presented the predecessor or the company had not been required to contribute under these minimum funding requirements however the predecessor chose to contribute to the us defined benefit pension plan 33 million 130 million and 100 million for three months ended march 31 2004 and for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the successor chose to contribute to the us defined benefit pension plan 300 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 contributions to the german pension plans for the nine months ended december 31 2004 were 105 million benefits are generally based on years of service andor compensation various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate rates of increase in compensation levels expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care costs in addition to the above mentioned assumptions actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2004 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan which represents greater than 85 percent and 80 percent of pension plan assets and liabilities respectively on average the actual return on plan assets over the longterm 15 to 20 years has exceeded 90 however for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the us qualified defined benefit pension plan assets actual return was less than the expected longterm rate of return of plan assets the company had lowered the expected longterm rate of return on us qualified defined benefit pension plan assets from 90 to 85 as it expects lower future returns considering the lower inflationary environment

for the nine months ended december 31 2004 our expected longterm rate of return assumption for our us plans was 85 reflecting the generally expected moderation of longterm rates of return in the financial markets we estimate a 25 basis point decline in the expected longterm rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated 5 million in 2004 another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations at the end of each year we determine the appropriate discount rate which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome securities at december 31 2004 we lowered the discount rate to 588 from 625 at december 31 2003 for the us plans we estimate that a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate for the us pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated 5 million and less than 1 million respectively and our benefit obligations by approximately 130 million and approximately 13 million respectively

over the past several years cag had experienced significant increases in excess of 400 million in unrecognized net actuarial pension losses the losses were mainly due to asset losses resulting from asset returns that were less than the assumed rate of return and increases in the projected benefit obligation

other postretirement benefit plans plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements the postretirement benefit cost for the nine months ended december 31 2004 three months ended march 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 includes 21 million 8 million and 35 million respectively and the accrued postretirement liability was 406 million and 320 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively in other noncurrent liabilities the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense for example increasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the apbo at december 31 2004 and the 2004 postretirement benefit cost by approximately 2 million and less than 1 million and decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the apbo at september 30 2004 and the 2004 postretirement benefit cost by approximately 2 million and less than 1 million respectively see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

accounting for commitments and contingencies

the company is subject to a number of lawsuits claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of its business relating to and including product liability patent and intellectual property commercial contract antitrust and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements management routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications demands settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel available facts identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute as well as prior experience a determination of the amount of loss contingency required if any is assessed in accordance with sfas no 5  contingencies and commitments  and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements

cna holdings inc cna holdings a us subsidiary of ours and the predecessor which includes the us business now conducted by ticona along with shell chemical company shell and e i du pont de nemours dupont among others have been the defendants in a series of lawsuits alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail cna holdings has accrued its best estimate of its share of the plumbing actions at december 31 2004 and 2003 accruals were 73 million and 76 million respectively for this matter of which 11 million and 14 million respectively are included in current liabilities management believes that the plumbing actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements however if we were to incur an additional charge for this matter such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position but may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period the predecessors receivables relating to the anticipated recoveries from third party insurance carriers for this product liability matter are based on the probability of collection on the settlement agreements reached with a majority of the insurance carriers whose coverage level exceeds the receivables and based on the status of current discussions with other insurance carriers as of december 31 2004 and 2003 insurance claims receivables were 75 million and 63 million respectively collectibility could vary depending on the financial status of the insurance carriers

nutrinova inc a us subsidiary of nutrinova nutrition specialties  food ingredients gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of ours and the predecessor is party to various legal proceedings in the united states canada and europe alleging nutrinova inc engaged in unlawful anticompetitive behavior which affected the sorbates markets while it was a whollyowned subsidiary of hoechst in accordance with the 

demerger agreement between hoechst and celanese ag which became effective october 1999 cag the successor to hoechsts sorbates business was assigned the obligation related to these matters however hoechst agreed to indemnify celanese ag for 80 percent of payments for such obligations expenses related to this matter are recorded gross of any such recoveries from hoechst while the recoveries from hoechst which represents 80 percent of such expenses are recorded directly to shareholders equity net of tax as a contribution of capital

based on a review of the existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates matter including the status of governmental investigations as well as civil claims filed and settled we and the predecessor had remaining accruals of 145 million and 137 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively for the estimated loss relative to this matter although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty managements best estimate of the range of possible additional future losses and fines including any that may result from governmental proceedings as of december 31 2004 is between 0 and 9 million the estimated range of such possible future losses is managements best estimate taking into consideration potential fines and claims both civil and criminal that may be imposed or made in other jurisdictions at december 31 2004 and 2003 we and the predecessor had receivables recorded within current assets relating to the sorbates indemnification from hoechst of 116 million and 110 million respectively

business combinations

upon closing an acquisition the company estimates the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and consolidates the acquisition as soon as practicable given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired companys balance sheet frequently with implications for the purchase price of the acquisition then to adjust the acquired companys accounting policies procedures books and records to our standards it is often several quarters before the company is able to finalize those initial fair value estimates accordingly it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised the judgements made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact net earnings loss

in valuing the acquisition of cag the company utilized various valuation methods with the assistance from valuation specialists the significant assets and liabilities valued include property plant and equipment intangible assets and cost and equity method investments

in connection with the acquisition of cag at the acquisition date the company began formulating a plan to exit or restructure certain activities the company has not completed this analysis but has recorded initial liabilities of 60 million primarily for employee severance and related costs in connection with the preliminary plan as well as approving the continuation of all existing predecessor restructuring and exit plans as the company finalizes its plans to exit or restructure activities it may record additional liabilities for among other things severance and severance related costs which would also increase the goodwill recorded

captive insurance companies

the company consolidates two wholly owned insurance companies the captives the captives are a key component of the companys global risk management program as well as a form of selfinsurance for property liability and workers compensation risks the captives issue insurance policies to the companys subsidiaries to provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the insurance market and to lower longterm insurance costs by avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees the captives issue insurance policies and coordinate claims handling services with third party service providers they retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained one of the captives also insures certain third party risks

the assets of the captives consist primarily of marketable securities and reinsurance receivables marketable securities values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes the carrying value of the amounts recoverable under the reinsurance agreements approximate fair value due to the shortterm nature of these items

the liabilities recorded by the captives relate to the estimated risk of loss recorded by the captives which is based on management estimates and actuarial valuations and unearned premiums which represent the portion of the premiums written applicable to the terms of the policies in force the establishment of the provision for outstanding losses is based upon known facts and interpretation of circumstances influenced by a variety of factors in establishing a provision management considers facts currently known and the current state of laws and litigation where applicable liabilities are recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and management can reasonably estimate their liability in addition liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure on both known and unasserted claims estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities

the captives use reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss reinsurance arrangements however do not relieve the captives from their obligations to policyholders failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the captives the captives evaluate the financial condition of their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies and establish allowances for amounts deemed noncollectable

premiums written are recognized based on the terms of the policies capitalization of the captives is determined by regulatory guidelines as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the net retained concurrent aggregate risk of all policies written by the captives after reinsuring higher tier risks with third party insurance companies net of established reserves amounted to approximately 498 million and 484 million respectively

risk factors

many factors could have an effect on celaneses financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the principal factors are described below

risks related to the acquisition of celanese ag

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative the companys managerial control over celanese ag is limited

we own 100 of the outstanding shares of cac and approximately 84 of the outstanding shares of cag our access to cash flows of and our control of cag is subject to the continuing effectiveness of the domination agreement see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity—domination agreement

the domination agreement is subject to legal challenges instituted by dissenting shareholders minority shareholders have filed nine actions against cag in the frankfurt district court  landgericht  seeking among other things to set aside the shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on july 30 and 31 2004 based among other things on the alleged violation of procedural requirements and information rights of the shareholders to declare the domination agreement and the change in the fiscal year void and to prohibit cag from performing its obligations under the domination agreement pursuant to german law the time period for the filing of such challenges has expired further several additional minority shareholders have joined the proceedings via third party intervention in support of the plaintiffs the purchaser has joined the proceedings via third party intervention in support of cag in addition a german court could revoke the registration of the domination agreement in the commercial register on august 2 2004 two minority shareholders instituted public register proceedings with the königstein local court  amtsgericht  and the frankfurt district court both with a view to have the registration of the domination agreement in the commercial register deleted  amtslöschungsverfahren  see legal proceedings

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative the purchasers ability and thus our ability to control the board of management decisions of cag will be significantly limited by german law as a result we may not be able to ensure that our strategy for the operation of our business can be fully implemented in addition our access to the operating cash flow of cag in order to fund payment requirements on our indebtedness will be limited which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock

if the domination agreement ceases to be operative certain actions taken under the domination agreement might have to be reversed

if legal challenges of the domination agreement by dissenting shareholders of cag are successful some or all actions taken under the domination agreement including the restructuring may be required to be reversed and the purchaser may be required to compensate cag for damages caused by such actions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and on the value of our stock

minority shareholders may interfere with cags future actions which may prevent us from causing cag to take actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

the purchaser currently owns approximately 84 of the cag shares shareholders unrelated to us hold the remainder of the outstanding cag shares german law provides certain rights to minority shareholders which could have the effect of delaying or interfering with corporate actions including those requiring shareholder approval such as the potential application for revocation of admission of the cag shares to the frankfurt stock exchange the squeezeout and the potential conversion of cag from its current legal form of a stock corporation into a limited partnership  kommanditgesellschaft kg  or a limited liability company  gesellschaft mit beschränkter haftung gmbh  in accordance with the 

provisions of the german transformation act  umwandlungsgesetz umwg  minority shareholders may be able to delay or prevent the implementation of cags corporate actions irrespective of the size of their shareholding any challenge by minority shareholders to the validity of a corporate action may be subject to judicial resolution that may substantially delay or hinder the implementation of such action such delays of or interferences with corporate actions as well as related litigation may limit our access to cags cash flows and make it difficult or impossible for us to take or implement corporate actions which may be desirable in view of our operating or financial requirements including actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

cags board of management may refuse to comply with instructions given by the purchaser pursuant to the domination agreement which may prevent us from causing cag to take actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

under the domination agreement the purchaser is entitled to give instructions directly to the board of management of cag including but not limited to instructions that are disadvantageous to cag as long as such disadvantageous instructions benefit the purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the purchaser or cag cags board of management is required to comply with any such instruction unless at the time when such instruction is given i it is in the opinion of the board of management of cag obviously not in the interests of the purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the purchaser or cag ii in the event of a disadvantageous instruction the negative consequences to cag are disproportionate to the benefits to the purchaser or the companies affiliated with either the purchaser or cag iii compliance with the instruction would violate legal or statutory restrictions iv compliance with the instruction would endanger the existence of cag or v it is doubtful whether the purchaser will be able to fully compensate cag as required by the domination agreement for its annual loss  jahresfehlbetrag  incurred during the fiscal year in which such instruction is given the board of management of cag remains ultimately responsible for making the executive decisions for cag and the purchaser despite the domination agreement is not entitled to act on behalf of and has no power to legally bind cag the cag board of management may delay the implementation of or refuse to implement any of the purchasers instructions despite its general obligation to follow such instructions with the exceptions mentioned above such delays of or interferences with compliance with the purchasers instructions by the board of management of cag may make it difficult or impossible for the purchaser to implement corporate actions which may be desirable in view of our operating or financial requirements including actions which may have beneficial effects for our shareholders

the purchaser will be required to ensure that cag pays a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the minority shareholders of cag which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us

as long as the purchaser does not own 100 of the outstanding cag shares the domination agreement requires among other things the purchaser to ensure that cag makes a gross guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  to minority shareholders of €327 per cag share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any future dividend taking into account the circumstances and the tax rates at the time of the entering into of the domination agreement the net guaranteed fixed annual payment is €289 per share for a full fiscal year as of december 31 2004 there were approximately 8 million cag shares held by minority shareholders the net guaranteed fixed annual payment may depending on applicable corporate tax rates in the future be higher lower or the same as €289 the amount of this guaranteed fixed annual payment was calculated in accordance with applicable german law such guaranteed fixed annual payments will be required regardless of whether the actual distributable profits per share of cag are higher equal to or lower than the amount of the guaranteed fixed annual payment per share the guaranteed fixed annual payment will be payable for so long as there are minority shareholders of cag and the domination agreement remains in place no dividends for the period after effectiveness of the domination agreement other than the guaranteed fixed annual payment effectively paid by the purchaser are expected to be paid by cag these requirements may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to celanese and its subsidiaries and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our respective indebtedness see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity—domination agreement

the amounts of the fair cash compensation and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment offered under the domination agreement may be increased which may further reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to us

several minority shareholders of cag have initiated special award proceedings  spruchverfahren  seeking the courts review of the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  offered under the domination agreement as a result of these proceedings the amounts of the fair cash compensation  abfindung  and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment  ausgleich  could be increased by the court and the purchaser would be required to make such payments within the two months after the publication of the courts ruling any such increase may be substantial all minority shareholders including those who have already received the fair cash compensation would be entitled to claim the respective higher amounts this may reduce the funds the purchaser can make available to celanese and its subsidiaries and accordingly diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness see legal proceedings

the purchaser may be required to compensate cag for annual losses which may reduce the funds the purchaser can otherwise make available to celanese

under the domination agreement the purchaser is required among other things to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred determined in accordance with german accounting requirements by cag at the end of the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred this obligation to compensate cag for annual losses will apply during the entire term of the domination agreement if cag incurs losses during any period of the operative term of the domination agreement and if such losses lead to an annual loss of cag at the end of any given fiscal year during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser will be obligated to make a corresponding cash payment to cag to the extent that the respective annual loss is not fully compensated for by the dissolution of profit reserves  gewinnrücklagen  accrued at the level of cag during the term of the domination agreement the purchaser may be able to reduce or avoid cash payments to cag by offsetting against such loss compensation claims by cag any valuable counterclaims against cag that the purchaser may have if the purchaser was obligated to make cash payments to cag to cover an annual loss we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our indebtedness when due and unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of cag the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity—domination agreement

two of our subsidiaries have agreed to guarantee the purchasers obligation under the domination agreement which may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness

our subsidiaries bcp caylux and bcp crystal have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing to strengthen the purchasers ability to fulfill its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement and to ensure that the purchaser will perform all of its obligations under or in connection with the domination agreement when such obligations become due including without limitation the obligations to make a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the outstanding minority shareholders to offer to acquire all outstanding cag shares from the minority shareholders in return for payment of fair cash consideration and to compensate cag for any annual loss incurred by cag during the term of the domination agreement if bcp caylux andor bcp crystal are obligated to make payments under such guarantees or other security to the purchaser andor the minority shareholders we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due

even if the minority shareholders challenges to the domination agreement are unsuccessful and the domination agreement continues to be operative we may not be able to receive distributions from cag sufficient to pay our obligations

even if the minority shareholders challenges to the domination agreement are unsuccessful and the domination agreement continues to be operative we are limited in the amount of distributions we may receive in any year from cag under german law the amount of distributions to the purchaser will be 

determined based on the amount of unappropriated earnings generated during the term of the domination agreement as shown in the unconsolidated annual financial statements of cag prepared in accordance with german accounting principles and as adopted and approved by resolutions of the cag board of management and supervisory board which financial statements may be different from celaneses consolidated financial statements under us gaap our share of these earnings if any may not be in amounts and at times sufficient to allow us to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due which could have a material adverse effect on the value of the stock

we must rely on payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our preferred stock and certain of our subsidiaries must rely on payments from their own subsidiaries to fund payments on their indebtedness such funds may not be available in certain circumstances

we must rely on payments from our subsidiaries to fund dividend redemption and other payments on our preferred stock in addition our subsidiaries bcp crystal and crystal us holdings 3 llc crystal llc are holding companies and all of their operations are conducted through their subsidiaries therefore they depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries including cag to meet their obligations including obligations of approximately 37 billion of our indebtedness after giving effect to the concurrent financings and excluding 242 million to be drawn down from our amended and restated credit facilities to fund the acetex acquisition if the domination agreement ceases to be operative such subsidiaries may be unable to meet their obligations under such indebtedness although the domination agreement became operative on october 1 2004 it is subject to legal challenges instituted by dissenting shareholders in august 2004 minority shareholders filed nine actions against cag in the frankfurt district court  landgericht  seeking among other things to set aside the shareholder resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on july 30 and 31 2004 based among other things on the alleged violation of procedural requirements and information rights of the shareholders to declare the domination agreement and the change in the fiscal year void and to prohibit cag from performing its obligations under the domination agreement pursuant to german law the time period for the filing of such challenges has expired further several additional minority shareholders have joined the proceedings via third party intervention in support of the plaintiffs the purchaser has joined the proceedings via third party intervention to support cag in addition a german court could revoke the registration of the domination agreement in the commercial register on august 2 2004 two minority shareholders instituted public register proceedings with the königstein local court  amtsgericht  and the frankfurt district court both with a view to have the registration of the domination agreement in the commercial register deleted  amtslöschungsverfahren  see legal proceedings the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us bcp crystal and crystal llc by way of dividends interest return on investments or other payments including loans or distributions is subject to various restrictions including restrictions imposed by the senior credit facilities and indentures governing their indebtedness and the terms of future debt may also limit or prohibit such payments in addition the ability of the subsidiaries to make such payments may be limited by relevant provisions of german and other applicable laws

our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation

we are evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules and regulations of the sec thereunder which we refer to as section 404 we are currently performing the system and process evaluation and testing required and any necessary remediation in an effort to comply with management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 will initially apply to celanese as of december 31 2006 and to cag as of september 30 2006 in the course of our ongoing section 404 evaluation we have identified areas of internal controls that may need improvement and plan to design enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues that might be identified through this review currently 

none of the identified areas that need improvement have been categorized as significant deficiencies or material weaknesses individually or in the aggregate however as we are still in the evaluation process we may identify conditions that may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future in 2004 certain members of our accounting staff identified two significant deficiencies and our auditors identified two material weaknesses in addition to and separate from our section 404 evaluation process as a result of the material weaknesses that were identified celanese concluded that as of december 31 2004 its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended were not effective for recording processing summarizing and reporting the material information celanese is required to disclose in the reports it files under the securities exchange act of 1934 within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the commission these deficiencies and material weaknesses are discussed in detail in the immediately subsequent risk factor and item 9a—controls and procedures

we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec as a result there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in addition we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel any such action could negatively affect our results

we expect to incur expenses of an aggregate of approximately 9 million to 14 million in 2005 in connection with our compliance with section 404

we have in the past identified significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls and the identification of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports

in addition to and separate from our evaluation of internal controls under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any areas requiring improvement that we identify as part of that process we previously identified two significant deficiencies and two material weaknesses in our internal controls the public company accounting oversight board pcaob defines a significant deficiency as a control deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the companys ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected the pcaob defines a material weakness as a single deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected

we are in the process of implementing changes to strengthen our internal controls in addition while we have taken actions to address these deficiencies and weaknesses additional measures may be necessary and these measures along with other measures we expect to take to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified by us or ensure that our internal controls are effective for a description of these deficiencies and weaknesses see item 9a — controls and procedures if we are unable to correct deficiencies or weaknesses in internal controls in a timely manner our ability to record process summarize and report financial information within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec will be adversely affected this failure could materially and adversely impact our business our financial condition and the market value of our securities

risks related to our indebtedness

our high level of indebtedness could diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry and prevent us from meeting obligations under our indebtedness

we are highly leveraged our total indebtedness totals approximately 37 billion after giving effect to the concurrent financings and excluding 242 million to be drawn down from our credit facilities to fund the acetex acquisition our substantial debt could have important consequences for you including

      despite our current high leverage we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks of our high leverage

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our existing debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so the revolving credit facilities provide commitments of up to 28 billion as of december 31 2004 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and availability of 401 million taking into account letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facilities we also expect to incur an additional 242 million of indebtedness under our amended and restated senior credit facilities to finance the acquisition of acetex if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on cash on hand receipt of additional capital including possible additional borrowings and receipt of cash from our subsidiaries by way of distributions advances or cash payments our total indebtedness totals approximately 37 billion after giving effect to the concurrent financings and excluding 242 million to be drawn down from our credit facilities to fund the acetex acquisition debt service requirements excluding the 242 million to be drawn down from our credit facilities to fund the acetex acquisition consist of principal repayments aggregating 285 million in the next five years and 3386 million thereafter including 211 million of accreted value on the senior discount notes and average annual cash interest payments of approximately 197 million in each of the next five years see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity—contractual obligations

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets including the cag shares seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness

the senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of crystal llc bcp crystal and their restricted subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase their capital stock or make other restricted payments make investments and sell certain assets

in addition the senior credit facilities contain covenants that require celanese holdings llc celanese holdings to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests celanese holdings ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control and it may not be able to meet those tests at all a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if celanese holdings were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness celanese holdings has pledged a significant portion of its assets as collateral under the senior credit facilities if the lenders under the senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings celanese holdings may not have sufficient assets to repay the senior credit facilities and its other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock

the terms of the senior credit facilities prohibit bcp crystal and its subsidiaries from paying dividends or otherwise transferring their assets to us

our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries however the terms of the senior credit facilities prohibit bcp crystal and its subsidiaries from paying dividends or otherwise transferring their assets to us accordingly under the terms of the senior credit facilities bcp crystal and its subsidiaries may not make dividends to us to enable us to pay dividends on our stock

risks related to our business

we are an international company and are exposed to general economic political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have significant operations

we operate in the global market and have customers in many countries during the period covered by this annual report we had major facilities located in north america europe and asia including facilities in germany china japan korea and saudi arabia operated through ventures our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically world market prices consequently our business and financial results are affected directly and indirectly by world economic political and regulatory conditions

conditions such as the uncertainties associated with war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics or political instability in any of the countries in which we operate could affect us by causing delays or losses 

in the supply or delivery of raw materials and products as well as increased security costs insurance premiums and other expenses these conditions could also result in or lengthen economic recession in the united states europe asia or elsewhere moreover changes in laws or regulations such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including import or export licensing requirements or changes in the reporting requirements of united states german or european union governmental agencies could increase the cost of doing business in these regions any of these conditions may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our securities including the stock

cyclicality in the industrial chemicals industry has in the past and may in the future result in reduced operating margins or in operating losses

consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in particular those in acetyl products such as methanol formaldehyde acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer has increased significantly over the past 30 years despite this growth in consumption producers have experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and excess capacity for these products periods of inadequate capacity including some due to raw material shortages have usually resulted in increased selling prices and operating margins this has often been followed by periods of capacity additions which have resulted in declining capacity utilization rates selling prices and operating margins we expect that these cyclical trends in selling prices and operating margins relating to capacity shortfalls and additions will likely persist in the future principally due to the continuing combined impact of five factors

     we believe that the basic chemicals industry particularly in the commodity chemicals manufactured by our chemical products segment is currently characterized by overcapacity and that there may be further capacity additions in the next few years

the length and depth of product and industry business cycles of our markets particularly in the automotive electrical construction and textile industries may result in reduced operating margins or in operating losses

some of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive electrical construction and textile industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products

we are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in raw materials prices and the availability of key raw materials

we purchase significant amounts of natural gas ethylene butane and propylene from third parties for use in our production of basic chemicals in the chemical products segment principally methanol formaldehyde acetic acid vinyl acetate monomer as well as oxo products we use a portion of our output 

of these chemicals in turn as inputs in the production of further products in all our segments we also purchase significant amounts of cellulose or wood pulp for use in our production of cellulose acetate in the acetate products segment we purchase significant amounts of natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil to supply the energy required in our production processes

prices of natural gas oil and other hydrocarbons have increased dramatically in 2004 to the extent this trend continues and we are unable to pass through these price increases to our customers our operating profit and results of operations may be less favorable than expected

we are exposed to any volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy although we have agreements providing for the supply of natural gas ethylene propylene wood pulp electricity coal and fuel oil the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include

    we strive to improve profit margins of many of our products through price increases when warranted and accepted by the market however our operating margins may decrease if we cannot pass on increased raw material prices to customers even in periods during which raw material prices decline we may suffer decreasing operating profit margins if raw material price reductions occur at a slower rate than decreases in the selling prices of our products

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supplydemand fundamentals change we manage our exposure through the use of derivative instruments and forward purchase contracts for commodity price hedging entering into longterm supply agreements and multiyear purchasing and sales agreements managements policy for the majority of its natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2004 there were no derivative contracts outstanding in 2003 there were forward contracts covering approximately 35 of the companys chemical products segment north american requirements management regularly assesses its practice of purchasing a portion of its commodity requirements forward and the utilization of a variety of other raw material hedging instruments in addition to forward purchase contracts in accordance with changes in market conditions management capped its exposure on approximately 20 of its us natural gas requirements during the months of august and september of 2004 the fixed price natural gas forward contracts and any premium associated with the purchase of a price cap are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap or cap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing or limiting predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts were structured to limit exposure to increases in commodity prices certain swaps may also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap or cap contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges

we have a policy of maintaining when available multiple sources of supply for raw materials however some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials such as carbon monoxide and acetaldehyde we may not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials due to unforeseen developments that would cause an interruption in supply even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material these sources may not make up for the loss of a major supplier nor can there be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply in the event of the loss of a sole or a major supplier

failure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully may harm our competitive position

our operating results especially in our performance products and technical polymers ticona segments depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products product grades 

and applications as well as production technologies if we are unsuccessful in developing new products applications and production processes in the future our competitive position and operating results will be negatively affected likewise we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings these initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized

frankfurt airport expansion could require us to reduce production capacity of limit expansion potential of or incur relocation costs for our kelsterbach plant which would lead to significant additional costs

the frankfurt airports expansion plans include the construction of an additional runway one of the three sites under consideration the northwest option would be located in close proximity to our kelsterbach production plant the construction of this particular runway could have a negative effect on the plants current production capacity and future development while the government of the state of hesse and the owner of the frankfurt airport promote the expansion of the northwest option it is uncertain whether this option is in accordance with applicable laws although the government of the state of hesse expects the plan approval for the airport expansion in 2007 and the start of operations in 20092010 neither the final outcome of this matter nor its timing can be predicted at this time

environmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines cleanups and other damages require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs

costs related to our compliance with environmental laws concerning and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites may have a significant negative impact on our operating results these include obligations related to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or where waste from our operations was disposed we also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between cag and hoechst also referred to as the demerger agreement for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger our accruals for environmental remediation obligations 143 million as of december 31 2004 may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying those accruals prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for currently undiscovered contamination see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—environmental liabilities and notes 19 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements

our operations are subject to extensive international national state local and other supranational laws and regulations that govern environmental and health and safety matters we incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with these requirements if we violate them we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations and could subject our handling manufacture use reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present consequently compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities and our business and operating results may be less favorable than expected due to new air regulations in the united states management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately 30 million to 45 million through 2007 for example the miscellaneous organic national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap regulations and various approaches to regulating boilers and incinerators including the neshaps for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters will impose additional requirements on our operations although some of these rules have been finalized a significant portion of the neshaps for industrialcommercialinstitutional boilers and process heaters regulation that provides for a low risk alternative method of compliance for hydrogen chloride emissions has been challenged in federal court we cannot predict the outcome of this challenge which could if successful increase our costs by according to our estimates approximately 50 million above the 30 million to 45 million noted above through 2007 to comply with this regulation as another example recent european union regulations require a trading system for carbon dioxide emissions to have been in place by january 1 2005 accordingly an emission trading system came into 

effect at the start of 2005 this regulation will affect our power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites as well as power plants operated by other infraserv entities we and the infraserv entities may be required to develop additional costeffective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further which could result in increased capital expenditures

we are also involved in several claims lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters an adverse outcome in any of them may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period

changes in environmental health and safety regulatory requirements could lead to a decrease in demand for our products

new or revised governmental regulations relating to health safety and the environment may also affect demand for our products pursuant to the european union regulation on risk assessment of existing chemicals the european chemicals bureau of the european commission has been conducting risk assessments on approximately 140 major chemicals some of the chemicals initially being evaluated include vinyl acetate monomer or vam which we produce these risk assessments entail a multistage process to determine to what extent the european commission should classify the chemical as a carcinogen and if so whether this classification and related labeling requirements should apply only to finished products that contain specified threshold concentrations of a particular chemical in the case of vam we currently do not expect a final ruling until mid2005 we and other vam producers are participating in this process with detailed scientific analyses supporting the industrys position that vam is not a probable human carcinogen and that labeling of final products should not be required if labeling is required then it should depend on relatively high parts per million of residual vam in these end products we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any final ruling

several recent studies have investigated possible links between formaldehyde exposure and various end points including leukemia the international agency for research on cancer or iarc recently reclassified formaldehyde from group 2a probable human carcinogen to group 1 known human carcinogen based on studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer a rare cancer in humans iarc also concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde although it also characterized evidence for such an association as strong the results of iarcs review will be examined by government agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements we are a producer of formaldehyde and plastics derived from formaldehyde we are participating together with other producers and users in the evaluations of these findings we cannot predict the final effect of iarcs reclassification

other recent initiatives will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the united states as well as various european commission programs such as the new european environment and health strategy commonly known as scale as well as the proposal for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach reach which the european commission proposed in october 2003 will establish a system to register and evaluate chemicals manufactured in or imported to the european union depending on the final ruling additional testing documentation and risk assessments will occur for the chemical industry this will affect european producers of chemicals as well as all chemical companies worldwide that export to member states of the european union the final ruling has not yet been decided

the abovementioned assessments in the united states and europe may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products

our production facilities handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results

our operations are subject to operating risks associated with chemical manufacturing including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these hazards include among other things

   these operating risks can cause personal injury property damage and environmental contamination and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties the occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and our operating results and cash flows

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance which we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices but we cannot predict whether this insurance will be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to our business

our significant nonus operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our profitability

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates

as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the united states fluctuations in currencies of other countries especially the euro may materially affect our operating results for example changes in currency exchange rates may affect

  we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the net notional amounts under such foreign currency contracts outstanding at december 31 2004 were 288 million the hedging activity of foreign currency denominated intercompany net receivables resulted in a cash inflow of approximately 24 million and less than 1 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 respectively these positive effects may not be indicative of future effects

a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in our consolidated financial statements we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period during times of a strengthening us dollar at a constant level of business our reported international sales earnings assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars we estimate that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 3 for the nine months ended december 31 2004 6 for the three months ended march 31 2004 7 for the year ended december 31 2003 and increased net sales by approximately 2 in 2002 we estimate that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased total assets by approximately 3 for the nine months ended december 31 2004 decreased total assets by approximately 1 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and increased total assets by approximately 5 in 2003

in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiarys functional currency given the volatility of exchange rates we may not be able to manage our currency transaction andor translation risks effectively or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk since a 

portion of our indebtedness is and will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost

our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that over the long run will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets a change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost of the following fiscal years as of december 31 2004 our underfunded position related to our defined benefit pension plans was 636 million during the nine months ended december 31 2004 we contributed approximately 434 million to the plans during the three months ended march 31 2004 we contributed approximately 39 million to the plans

we have preliminarily recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets

in connection with the transactions we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other net identifiable intangible assets were approximately 1147 million as of december 31 2004 or 15 of our total assets based on preliminary purchase accounting goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets will be reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in our performance adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services sold by our business and a variety of other factors the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations depending on future circumstances it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination of impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

cag may be required to make payments to hoechst

under its 1999 demerger agreement with hoechst cag agreed to indemnify hoechst for environmental liabilities that hoechst may incur with respect to cags german production sites which were transferred from hoechst to cag in connection with the demerger cag also has an obligation to indemnify hoechst against liabilities for environmental damages or contamination arising under certain divestiture agreements entered into by hoechst prior to the demerger as the indemnification obligations depend on the occurrence of unpredictable future events the costs associated with them are not yet determinable and may materially affect operating results cags obligation to indemnify hoechst against liabilities for environmental contamination in connection with the divestiture agreements is subject to the following thresholds translated into us dollars using the december 31 2004 exchange rate

  112

 cag has made payments through december 31 2004 of 38 million for environmental contamination liabilities in connection with the divestiture agreements and may be required to make additional payments in the future as of december 31 2004 we have reserves of approximately 46 million for this contingency and may be required to record additional reserves in the future

also cag has undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify hoechst to the extent that hoechst is required to discharge liabilities including tax liabilities in relation to assets included in the demerger where such liabilities have not been demerged due to transfer or other restrictions cag did not make any payments to hoechst in 2004 and did not make any payments in either 2003 or 2002 in connection with this indemnity

under the demerger agreement cag will also be responsible directly or indirectly for all of hoechsts obligations to past employees of businesses that were demerged to cag under the demerger agreement hoechst agreed to indemnify cag from liabilities other than liabilities for environmental contamination stemming from the agreements governing the divestiture of hoechsts polyester businesses which were demerged to cag insofar as such liabilities relate to the european part of that business hoechst has also agreed to bear 80 percent of the financial obligations arising in connection with the government investigation and litigation associated with the sorbates industry for price fixing described in legal proceedings—sorbates antitrust actions and note 27 to the consolidated financial statements and cag has agreed to bear the remaining 20 percent

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and affect our operating results

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under the senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase which we expect to occur our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 11 billion of variable rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 11 million

we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our debt portfolio we have in the past used swaps for hedging purposes only

because our sponsor controls us the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited and conflicts of interest between our sponsor and us or you could arise in the future

our sponsor as defined in this document beneficially owns approximately 63 of our outstanding common stock as a result our sponsor through its control over the composition of our board of directors and its control of the majority of the voting power of our common stock has effective control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of equityholders regardless of whether or not other equityholders or noteholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests for example our sponsor effectively could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or sell revenuegenerating assets additionally our sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us our sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant amount of our equity even if such amount is less than 50 it will continue to be able to significantly influence or effectively control our decisions under the amended and restated shareholders agreement between us and the original shareholders which are affiliates of the sponsor such original shareholders will be entitled to designate all nominees for election to our board of directors for so long as they hold at least 25 of the total voting power of our common stock thereafter although our sponsor will not have an explicit contractual right to do so it may still nominate directors in its capacity as a stockholder 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy that we have in or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in specified business opportunities

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of the original shareholders including the sponsor or their affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from i engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or our affiliates now engage or propose to engage or ii otherwise competing with us in addition in the event that any of the original shareholders including the sponsor or any nonemployee director acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for itself or himself or its or his affiliates and for us or our affiliates such original shareholder or nonemployee director has no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us and may take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another person or entity

we are a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements

our sponsor controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards under the new york stock exchange rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by another company is a controlled company and need not comply with certain requirements including 1 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 the requirement that the nominating committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities 3 the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities and 4 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees we utilize these exemptions as a result we do not have a majority of independent directors nor do our nominating and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors accordingly our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our market position and our margins

we attach great importance to patents trademarks copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our policy is to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in its major markets patents may cover products processes intermediate products and product uses protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce

as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public our european and us patents for making sunett an important product in our performance products segment expired at the end of the first quarter of 2005 which will reduce our ability to realize revenues from making sunett due to increased competition and potential limitations and will result in our results of operations and cash flows relating to the product being less favorable than today

we also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products which brand names become more important once the corresponding patents have expired if we are not successful in protecting our trademark rights our revenues results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected

the market price of our common stock and bcp crystals public debt may be volatile which could cause the value of our shareholders investment and the debt holders investment respectively to decline

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock and bcp crystals public debt in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our common stock and bcp crystals public debt could decrease significantly

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as any shareholders rights plan may discourage a takeover attempt

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our shareholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our series a common stock these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company in addition a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors each class elected for a three year term in addition we would be required to issue additional shares of our series a common stock to holders of the preferred stock who convert following a fundamental change these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risks

we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations our market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices the predecessor had in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices as described below contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 148 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities  see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements

foreign exchange risk management

we and the predecessor have receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the various subsidiaries which create foreign exchange risk for the purposes of this document the predecessors reporting currency is the us dollar the functional reporting currency of celanese ag continues to be the euro the us dollar the euro mexican peso japanese yen british pound sterling and canadian dollar are the most significant sources of currency risk accordingly we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the foreign currency contracts are designated for recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions the terms of these contracts are generally under one year our centralized hedging strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables or liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be internally hedged only the remaining net foreign exchange position will then be hedged externally with banks as a result foreign currency forward contracts relating to this centralized strategy did not meet the criteria of sfas no 133 to qualify for hedge accounting net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized on the underlying transactions which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts

on june 16 2004 as part of its currency risk management the company entered into a currency swap with certain financial institutions under the terms of the swap arrangement the company will pay 

approximately €13 million in interest and receive approximately 16 million in interest on each june 15 and december 15 with interest for the first period prorated upon maturity of the swap agreement on june 16 2008 the company will pay approximately €276 million and receive approximately 333 million the company designated the swap the euro term loan and a euro note as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2004 the loss related to the swap was 21 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 of which 14 million is related to the ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge during the nine months ended december 31 2004 the effects of the swap resulted in an increase in total liabilities and a decrease in shareholders equity of 57 million and 36 million respectively

contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 288 million and 765 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively are predominantly in us dollars british pound sterling japanese yen and canadian dollars the company recognizes net foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the underlying transactions which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2004 the companys foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets and an increase in total liabilities of 42 million and 2 million respectively as of december 31 2004 these contracts in addition to natural hedges hedged approximately 100 of the companys net receivables held in currencies other than the entities functional currency for the companys european operations related to the unhedged portion during the year a net gain loss of approximately 2 million and 4 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense net for the nine months ended december 31 2004 and the three months ended march 31 2004 during 2003 the predecessors foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets of 8 million and an increase in total liabilities of 1 million as of december 31 2003 these contracts hedged a portion approximately 85 of the predecessors us dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated entities related to the unhedged portion a net loss of approximately 14 million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense net in 2003 during the year ended december 31 2002 the predecessor hedged all of its us dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated entities therefore there was no material net effect from foreign exchange gains or losses receivables yielded cash flows from operating activities of approximately 24 million less than 1 million hedging activities primarily related to intercompany net receivables yielded cash flows from operating activities of approximately 17 million 180 million and 95 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

a substantial portion of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than us dollar principally the euro fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the value of the euro can have and in the past have had a direct and material impact on the business and financial results for example a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to translation effects likewise an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect the company estimates that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 3 and increased total assets by approximately 3 for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the predecessor estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately 6 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and by approximately 7 for the year ended december 31 2003 and by approximately 2 in 2002 the predecessor also estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar decreased total assets by approximately 1 for the three months ended march 31 2004 and increased total assets by approximately 5 in 2003 exposure to transactional effects is further reduced by a high degree of overlap between the currencies in which sales are denominated and the currencies in which the raw material and other costs of goods sold are denominated

as of december 31 2004 we had total debt of 3387 million of which approximately 610 million €447 million is euro denominated debt a 1 increase in foreign exchange rates would increase the euro denominated debt by 6 million

interest rate risk management

the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in the companys outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of fixedfloating rate debt depending on market conditions at december 31 2004 the successor had no interest rate swap agreements in place the predecessor had open interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 200 million at december 31 2003 in the second quarter of 2004 the successor recorded a loss of less than 1 million in other income expense net associated with the early termination of its 200 million interest rate swap during 2003 the predecessor recorded a loss of 7 million in other income expense net associated with the early termination of one of its interest rate swaps the successor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of 1 million for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the predecessor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of 2 million 11 million and 12 million for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 during 2003 the predecessors interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges resulted in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities and an increase in shareholders equity of 4 million 14 million and 7 million net of related income tax of 4 million respectively the predecessor recorded a net gain loss of less than 1 million 2 million and 3 million in other income expense net of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps during the three months ended march 31 2004 and the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the concurrent financings as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 1900 million of variable rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 19 million

commodity risk management

the companys policy for the majority of our natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cashsettled swap contracts fixed price natural gas forward contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity the maturities of the cashsettled swap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices for the underlying commodity although these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices these cashsettled swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract the successor recognized losses of less than 1 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the predecessor recognized losses of 1 million 3 million and less than 1 million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the three months ended march 31 2004 and the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively there was no material impact on the balance sheet at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 there were no unrealized gains and losses associated with the cashsettled swap contracts as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 the company did not have any open commodity swaps as of december 31 2004 the company had open swaps with a notional amount of 5 million as of december 31 2003




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none




 item 9a controls and procedures 

in 2004 certain members of our accounting staff identified two significant deficiencies in internal controls in the computation of certain accounting adjustments these deficiencies were discovered in addition to and separate from the evaluation process we are conducting in connection with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 which is further described below the first deficiency was identified during the quarter ended june 30 2004 by members of our corporate financial reporting group and related to the qualifications and ability of certain accounting managers to initially calculate the change from the lifo lastin firstout method of accounting for inventories to fifo firstin firstout and the resulting failure of such employees to correctly make such calculations the second was identified during the quarter ended june 30 2004 by one of our financial accounting managers and related to an omitted employee benefit accrual due to the failure to provide the applicable employment contracts to the actuary prior to the cutoff date for the december 31 2003 pension valuation corrective actions taken by us included an internal audit review the development of enhanced guidelines the termination and reassignment of responsible persons and an elevation of the issues to the supervisory board of celanese ag the significant deficiencies noted were identified and corrected in the quarter ended september 30 2004 and thus did not exist as of december 31 2004

on march 30 2005 we received a letter from kpmg llp kpmg our independent auditors identifying two material weaknesses these material weaknesses were determined in the course of the audit of our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended december 31 2004 the first material weakness related to several deficiencies in the assessment of effectiveness and documentation of derivative financial instruments the required adjustments were made in the proper accounting period and we do not believe they had any material impact on previously reported financial information the second material weakness was for the same period and related to conditions preventing our ability to adequately research document review and draw conclusions on accounting and reporting matters which resulted in adjustments that had to be recorded to prevent our financial statements from being materially misleading the conditions largely related to significant increases in the frequency of and the limited amount of time and technical accounting resources available to address complex accounting matters and transactions and as a result of the consummation of simultaneous debt and equity offerings during the yearend closing process in response to the letter from kpmg we are increasing the resources within our finance organization to include experts in the accounting for derivative financial instruments and in financial reporting including tax accounting issues we are also taking steps to ensure that adequate time is made available for company personnel to adequately research document review and conclude on accounting and reporting matters these initiatives have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect materially our internal controls over financial reporting

celanese under the supervision and with the participation of celaneses management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of celaneses disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the commission based on this evaluation and as a result of the foregoing material weaknesses that were identified celaneses ceo and cfo concluded that as of december 31 2004 the end of the period covered by this annual report celaneses disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for gathering analyzing and disclosing the material information celanese is required to disclose in the reports it files under the securities exchange act of 1934 within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the commssion except as discussed above there have been no significant changes in celaneses internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect internal controls over financial reporting

beginning with the fiscal year ending december 31 2006 section 404 will require us to include an internal control report of management with our annual report on form 10k the internal control report must contain 1 a statement of managements responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate 

internal control over financial reporting for us 2 a statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 3 managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and 4 a statement that our independent auditors have issued an attestation report on managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting

in connection therewith we are currently performing the system and process evaluation and testing required and any necessary remediation in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 in the course of our ongoing section 404 evaluation we have identified areas of internal controls that may need improvement and plan to design enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues that might be identified through this review as we are still in the evaluation process we may identify other conditions that may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future

we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance or our independent auditors are not able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the commission as a result there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in addition we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel any such action could negatively affect our results

we expect to incur expenses in an aggregate of approximately 9 million to 14 million in the 2005 fiscal year in connection with our preparation for compliance with section 404
