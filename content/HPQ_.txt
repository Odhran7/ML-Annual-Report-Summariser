corporate investments 

corporate investments includes hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two including 

• retailers that sell our products to the public focusing on consumers and smbs 

• resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups 

• distribution partners that supply our products and solutions to resellers and 

• system integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services including systems integration work and asaservice solutions and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services 

the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market we believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and subgeographic specificities for each of our businesses we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers for other customers and for consumers we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and smbs and commercial resellers mainly targeting smbs and midmarket accounts see “risk factors— if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers “oms” around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand additionally we manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing or readily available alternate sources of supply however we have relied on sole sources for some laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations mitigating the effect of a disruption for instance we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of a3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either 

party not to renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft and google for various software products we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see “risk factors—we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on our reliance on singlesource suppliers 

like other participants in the information technology “it” industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see “risk factors—we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products we strive to make our products and packaging in an ethical and sustainable manner we have committed to building an efficient resilient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations such as supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainable impact report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers’ demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce this provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products we believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus on diversity and inclusion gives us a solid base on which to build future growth see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business geopolitical or economic changes or events uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance and we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results in item 1a which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation across products services business models and processes is a key element of our culture and success our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see “risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2022 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 28000 patents including patents acquired as a result of our acquisition of plantronics inc “poly” in august 2022 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is essential to hp as a whole or to any of hp’s business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property “ip” from third parties we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see “risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop obtain license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” and “risk factors—thirdparty claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by supply constraints shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of macroeconomic challenges and different demand dynamics see “risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service support and solutions including subscriptionbased offerings and financing security availability of application software and our sustainability performance 

the markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments 

the competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below 

personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions our primary competitors are lenovo group limited dell inc huawei technologies co ltd acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation microsoft corporation and samsung electronics co ltd in particular geographies we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or “white box” manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our innovative design work our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing  the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products our primary competitors include canon inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation ltd seiko epson corporation the ricoh company ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer nonoriginal supplies including imitation refill and remanufactured alternatives which are often available for lower prices but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to hp original inkjet and toner supplies these and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers or distributors or such resellers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost nonoriginal supplies our competitive advantages include our comprehensive highquality solutions for the home office and publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features sustainability our brand and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors see “risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products and their safe use 

we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account among other things published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment 

we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as “product takeback legislation” we are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption carbon emissions reusing or recycling we intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs 

in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws or standards our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations supply chain and our products are currently and expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change such as climate disclosure carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements requiring us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines we strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more costeffective and lower carbon technology solutions to our customers we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business this commitment is reflected and outlined in our sustainability policy our comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

our business and financial performance depends on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for our products and services in the markets in which we compete ongoing economic weakness including an economic slowdown or recession uncertainty in markets throughout the world and other adverse economic conditions including inflation changes in monetary policy and increased interest rates have resulted and may result in the future in decreased demand for our products and services and increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels and accurately forecasting revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses for example in part due to ongoing economic uncertainty we observed a decline in consumer demand beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 particularly with respect to consumer pcs ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services 

prolonged or more severe economic weakness and uncertainty could also cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice poor financial performance of asset markets and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses 

due to the international nature of our business geopolitical or economic changes or events uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

more than 65 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2022 came from outside the united states in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations changes or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy actual or anticipated military or political conflicts including the russian invasion of ukraine and its regional and global ramifications and tensions across the taiwan strait health emergencies or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or brexit and its impact 

• the imposition by governments of additional taxes tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the united states and other countries including china and russia 

• trade including trade embargoes and other policies laws and regulations affecting production shipping pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by the united states or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors or other country localization requirements 

• political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade including the willingness of nonus consumers to purchase goods or services from us corporations 

• managing a geographically dispersed workforce and local labor conditions and regulations including labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers “oems” or changes to immigration and labor law which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent 

• changes or uncertainty in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments including tax laws and antitrust laws 

• differing technology standards customer requirements or levels of protection of intellectual property 

• import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws and adverse consequences such as fines or other penalties for any failure to comply including compliance by poly or other acquired companies which may have less robust internal compliance procedures and 

• fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points for our products and shipments 

the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states and our supply chain for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture in addition the impact of the russian invasion of ukraine including any escalation or expansion and the ancillary geopolitical economic and other effects of that invasion can also heighten the other risks identified in this report 

our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition have been and could continue to be affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty while covid19 positively impacted demand for some of our products and services these trends and consumer behavior have started to change as a result of macroeconomic factors and we are not experiencing a continuation of such increased demand in addition consumer behavior and the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain 

covid19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products our manufacturing sites as well as those of our channel partners suppliers and outsourcing partners and our supply chain have been adversely and may continue to be adversely impacted as a result of restrictions and logistics and operational challenges related to covid19 including zerocovid policies and lockdowns in china or elsewhere these disruptions have resulted and may continue to result in supply shortages and delays impacting sales worldwide for both personal systems and print as well as incremental costs we may experience further disruptions to our manufacturing operations supply chain andor distribution channels in the future and these disruptions may be prolonged 

covid19 may also affect our business and financial results in ways that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider as significant the ultimate impact depends on many factors that are not within our control including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic variants and resurgences governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including closures quarantines and similar actions general economic uncertainty in global markets and financial market volatility and global economic conditions and levels of economic growth 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars global events including the russian invasion of ukraine trade disputes economic sanctions inflation increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility and the resulting uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate which may contribute to variations in sales of our products and services in impacted jurisdictions because a majority of our revenues are generated outside the united states fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our net revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states as well as our ability to implement price increases from time to time we may use derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign 

currency exchange rate risks our hedging strategies may be ineffective may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations or may result in losses 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue cash flows and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures manufacturing equipment failures cybersecurity attacks data breaches power or water shortages natural disasters fires extreme weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise such as those described in “climate change may have a longterm impact on our business” below medical epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured terrorist acts conflicts or wars for which we are predominantly uninsured may also disrupt our worldwide operations the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain andor result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions our operations and those of our significant suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in key locations including logistics hubs in asia are disrupted for any reason such as those described above or other economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political reasons in addition even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their orders or these events could otherwise result in a decrease in demand for our products 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever our business is conducted global climate change is resulting and is projected to continue to result in certain natural disasters and adverse weather such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise flooding heat waves and cold waves occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such extreme events are driving changes in market dynamics stakeholder expectations local national and international climate change policies and regulations could result in disruptions to us our suppliers vendors customers and logistics hubs and impact employees’ abilities to commute or to work from home effectively these disruptions could make it more difficult and costly for us to deliver our products and services obtain components or other supplies through our supply chain maintain or resume operations or perform other critical corporate functions and could reduce customer demand for our products and services 

the increasing concern over climate change could also result in transition risks such as shifting customer preferences and regulations changing customer preferences may result in increased demands regarding our solutions products and services including the use of packaging materials and other components in our products and their environmental impact these demands may cause us to incur additional costs or make other changes to other operations to respond to such demands which could adversely affect our financial results if we fail to manage transition risks including such demands in an effective manner customer demand for our solutions products and services could diminish and our profitability could suffer concerns over climate change as well as the adoption of new laws or regulations may also impact market dynamics and may result in shifts in customer expectations preferences or requirements which may require us to change our practices or incur increased costs or adversely impact customer demand for our products and services additionally concerns over climate change have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in the adoption of legal and regulatory requirements designed to address climate change as well as legal and regulatory requirements requiring certain climaterelated disclosures where new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations ultimately the impacts of climate change whether involving physical risks such as disruptions resulting from climaterelated events or rising sea levels or transition risks such as regulatory changes changes in market dynamics or increased operating costs including the cost of insurance are expected to be widespread and unpredictable and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities reduce access to capital markets andor market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition to our current total debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt level and related debt service obligations could have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures dividends acquisitions and other general corporate purposes our indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions we may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service obligations debt refinancing future acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes which will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control and could be adversely impacted by our debt level consequently we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all which could adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business and financial condition additionally further indebtedness may increase the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividends are affected by a number of factors and may fluctuate 

although historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and we have adopted a share repurchase program we are not obligated to pay cash dividends or to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors the level of dividends and amount timing and purchases under our share repurchase program if any are influenced by many factors and may fluctuate based on our operating results cash flows and priorities for the use of cash and because of changes in tax laws and the market price of our common stock  in addition we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in connection with the preparation of our financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report for example we make significant estimates and assumptions when accounting for revenue recognition taxes on earnings and restructuring and other charges and when including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies we also estimate sales and marketing program incentives based on a number of factors including historical experience expected customer behavior and market conditions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

strategic and operational risks 

we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results 

we have been operating in a supplyconstrained environment and are facing and may continue to face component shortages logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our revenues profitability and cash flows we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and their ability to deliver sufficient quantities of key components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet schedules for the delivery of our products and services in addition our operations depend on our ability to anticipate and our suppliers’ ability to fulfill our needs for sufficient quantities of key components products and services including sourcing matched sets given the wide variety of products and services we offer the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems have and could continue to arise in production planning and inventory management and regulatory compliance that could seriously harm our business thirdparty suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations due to the international nature of our thirdparty supplier network our financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers increased tariffs and localization requirements which could increase the cost or availability of certain components products and services that we may not be able to offset 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their 

suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit or if any of our distributors lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain for cost or redundancy could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers “oms” may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs jeopardizing our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations which could in turn result in a decrease in sales profitability and cash flows contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships 

other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers risks related to supply chain working conditions human rights and materials sourcing and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 

• component shortages we have and may continue to experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems we face during the transition to new suppliers for example a market shortage of integrated circuits and panels and other component supply has affected and may affect in the future lead times the cost of that supply and our ability to meet customer demand for our products additionally our personal systems business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture our products and we are therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to manufacture our products to fulfill demand we represent a substantial portion of the business for certain oms and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving component products from that om if shortages or delays in component products persist the price of certain components may increase further we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly we may lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers due to such component shortages or delays if we cannot adequately address a component supply issue we may have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

• excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services we have and may continue to make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and may be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our personal systems business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition in order to secure components we may accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to effectively manage this workforce could adversely affect our financial results our ability to manage the costs associated with engaging a contingent workforce may be impacted by evolving local labor rights laws 

• working conditions human rights and materials sourcing  our brand perception customer loyalty and legal compliance could be adversely impacted by a supplier’s improper practices or failure to comply with our requirements for environmentally socially or legally responsible practices and sourcing 

• singlesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from a single source due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges and certain key suppliers for application specific integrated circuits “asics” we also rely on both intel and amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for the majority of our pcs and workstations some of those processors may be customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained initially from only one source until we have determined whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components alternative sources may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in certain circumstances we purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of deterioration of our relationship with or limits in allocation by a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is to strengthen our core businesses innovate and develop new products services and solutions expand into adjacencies and grow organically and inorganically to execute our strategy we must among other things optimize our cost structure make longterm investments develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property commit significant research and development and other resources evolve our gotomarket strategy and business model to meet changing market dynamics forces and demand in addition we need to innovate develop and execute on evolutionary strategies in a rapidly changing and increasingly hybrid environment seize on disruptive opportunities and effectively respond to secular trends and shifts in customer preferences our financial performance will depend in part on our ability to remain competitive in offerings geared towards hybrid consumption for example we believe we and others in our industry face longterm challenges related to among other things decreased demand for printing products and solutions as a result of increased digitization and hybrid work and increasing competition from generic alternatives we may be unable to successfully execute our strategy sufficiently invest in prioritize research and development or market and scale strategic growth areas accurately predict technological or business trends or control costs moreover the process of developing new hightechnology products services and solutions and enhancing existing products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to customers’ changing needs or the timing of those needs or accurately identify emerging technological trends in addition our ability to successfully offer our products services and solutions in this rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively calibrate and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in addition we may be unable to appropriately prioritize and balance our initiatives or effectively manage change throughout our organization 

our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation technological change and customer preferences even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies including those created by our competitors may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhancement of our existing products and technologies or develop new ones as a result we could fail to maintain market leadership in certain of our products such as commercial pcs and notebooks and any of our products and technologies may be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 

after we develop a product we must be able to quickly manufacture appropriate volumes while also managing costs and preserving or improving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed in doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable the operating margins may not be as high as the historical or anticipated margins 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure 

offerings and our sustainability performance we have faced and may continue to face declines in market share for our products including in personal systems if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations cash flows and business prospects could be affected 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines because of the size and scope of our portfolio we may invest a greater percentage of our revenues including on research and development than some of our competitors as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available for their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services or greater economies of scale which could in turn result in our inability to maintain market leadership in certain of our products such as commercial pcs and notebooks in addition if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our alliance partners in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in others in addition these partners also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us 

we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive price competition and have lowered and may in the future need to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our market share revenue and gross margin competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions andor more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply have been able to offer and may continue to be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer price competition often increases during periods of lower demand including as a result of declining macroeconomic conditions the sales prices for our products may also decline as a result of discounts a change in or mix of products and services anticipation of the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors we may also provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which the sales occur 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate our competitors may also affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers furthermore nonoriginal supplies including imitation refill or remanufactured alternatives which are often available at lower prices compete with our printing supplies business and we may not be able to prevent the use of imitation print supplies with our printers using technological protection measures in addition online and omnichannel retailers resellers and distributors often sell our products alongside competing products including nonoriginal supplies or they may highlight the availability of lower cost nonoriginal supplies we expect this competition will continue 

if we cannot continue to produce highquality and secure products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services including potential flaws in our engineering design and manufacturing processes unsatisfactory performance under service contracts and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by thirdparties many of our products are dependent on thirdparty software including from microsoft and google to function as intended and product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and thirdparty products and software our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in thirdparty components or materials included in our products including security vulnerabilities the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors particularly with respect to undiscovered defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties 

if we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality or security issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments we have and may again in the future write off some or all of the value of nonperforming inventory in addition after products are delivered quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing these issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs in the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with thirdparty components we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation which may be ineffective quality and security issues including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in thirdparty components can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation 

our operating results have historically varied and may not be indicative of future results 

our net revenue gross margin profit and cash flow generation vary among our portfolio of products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely vary in future periods overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services we have experienced and may continue to experience delays or reductions in spending by our customers or potential customers which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities moreover newer geographic markets can be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs increased tariffs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period these factors could also make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to suppliers and manufacturers manage our relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing our global multitier distribution network including the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins and we may fail to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services 

conflicts might arise between our various distribution channels we may experience the loss or deterioration of an alliance or distribution arrangement or a reduced assortments of our products we may not able to limit the potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners and we may fail to optimize the use of our pricing programs moreover some of our channel partners and distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends they may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors’ financial conditions abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing and factoring in supply chain challenges and order cancellations our forecasts may not accurately predict demand and distributors have and may continue to increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods including a multitiered channel may reduce our visibility into inventories demand and pricing trends and may therefore make forecasting and managing multitiered channel inventory more difficult 

if we were to expand direct distribution initiatives channel and indirect distributors could consider such initiatives in conflict with their business interests and reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of our products or cease all sales of our products sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products has and could continue to make our forecasting and channel inventory management more difficult and impact pricing in the market for example in the past we have had channel partners sell products outside of their agreed territory and misrepresent sales to unauthorized resellers as sales to endusers frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory or maintain consistent pricing and negatively impacting gross margins moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors in addition factors in different markets may cause differential discounting among the geographies where our products are sold which makes it difficult to achieve 

global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing in addition our global channel partners may fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages supply disruptions logistics challenges or declines in demand could adversely impact our inventory levels our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience seasonal trends in the sale of our products that may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter due in part to seasonal holiday demand and typically it has been our strongest quarter by revenues european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer may also be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends however historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and such patterns have been and may continue to be impacted by supply constraints macroeconomic conditions such as an economic slowdown or inflationary pressures shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of the covid19 pandemic moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margins many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

we may not be able to execute acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully and we may have difficulty or fail to successfully integrate acquired companies 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses such as our recent acquisition of poly divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business risks associated with these transactions include the following 

• we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of any particular transaction in the timeframe we expected or at all such transaction may be less profitable than anticipated or unprofitable we may not identify all factors to estimate accurately our costs timing or other matters and realizing the benefits of a particular transaction may depend upon competition market trends additional costs or investments and the actions of advisors suppliers or other third parties 

• certain transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to compensation and benefit costs goodwill and impairment charges charges from elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities advisory fees and payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

• our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the target’s product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal controls including as a result of being dependent on the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties 

• in order to finance a transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution or take on additional debt 

• these transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate 

• an acquisition target may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls 

• these transactions may lead to litigation 

in addition if we fail to identify successfully complete and integrate transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include impairment charges 

in the case of a divestiture we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in 

addition we may experience fewer benefits than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected 

the business combination and investment transactions in which we engage may be large or complex and we must manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integrations involve significant challenges and are often timeconsuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business these challenges include successfully combining product and service offerings entering or expanding into markets retaining key employees integrating employees facilities technology products processes operations including supply and manufacturing operations sales and distribution channels business models and business systems and retaining customers and distributors 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring plans in order to realign our cost structure and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs including the plan announced november 2022 implementation of any restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated cost savings operational improvements and estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency loss of key employees andor other retention issues during transitional periods restructuring can require a significant amount of time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business for more information about our restructuring plans see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop obtain license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property “ip” laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain ip rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however our ip rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such ip rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position in addition we may choose to not apply for patent protection or may fail to apply for patent protection in a timely fashion further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

in addition certain of our businesses and products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our ip thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our ip without compensation or on undesirable terms some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our ip rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these ip rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights finally we may rely on third parties to enforce certain ip rights 

thirdparty claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties have in the past claimed and may in the future claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their ip rights we have seen an increasing trend of patent assertion entities engaging in claims of infringement and assertion of patents to extract settlements if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed ip at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we 

believe that ip claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business claims of ip infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlements or license agreements pay damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain products additionally claims of ip infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships 

in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from us levies upon it equipment such as pcs and printers there have also been efforts to introduce modify or extend existing levy schemes and to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us the total amount of the copyright levies depends on several factors and could be substantial the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price 

we are exposed to cyberattacks from individuals and organizations including malicious computer programmers and hackers statesponsored organizations nationstates or other bad actors seeking to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns such attacks may involve the deployment of viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords other sensitive information or provide access to our systems or data such risks extend not only to our own products services systems and networks but also to those of customers suppliers contractors business partners vendors and other third parties particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects or vulnerabilities in design or manufacture including “bugs” that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the product breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harm our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our ip or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

additionally the costs to combat cyber or other security threats can be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security regardless of their immediacy or accuracy could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business 

while we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security threats such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches moreover these threats are constantly evolving thereby making it more difficult to successfully defend against them or to implement adequate preventative measures we may not have the current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow those vulnerabilities to persist in our systems over long periods of time in the past we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to or use of our systems or those of third parties which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impact will not be material in the future as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface we have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume frequency and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces geopolitical tensions or conflicts such as russia’s invasion of ukraine may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks while we carry cyber insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 

because we process proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of such data can expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss alteration or misuse of such information a breach could also damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business and could result in government enforcement actions litigation and potential liability for us we are subject to federal state and international laws relating to data protection particularly in the us european union and china such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” and governmental agencies are increasingly proposing regulatory requirements relating to data protection these laws and regulations continue to evolve are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict 

among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing new data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure including those provided by third parties may experience interruptions outages delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations migration work or other causes which could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive than planned such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes resulting in delayed sales lower margins lost customers or reputational damage 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly 

the success of our services business such as our managed print services digital services and other workforce solutions in both printing and personal systems depends to a significant degree on attracting retaining and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from our customers our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option andor subject to cancellation rights with or without penalties for early termination we may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our customers or our customers may reduce the scope of the services they contract for factors that may influence contract termination nonrenewal or reduction include business downturns dissatisfaction with our services or products our retirement or lack of support for our services our customers selecting alternative technologies the cost of our services as compared to our competitors general market conditions or other reasons we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost customers or reductions in services while our services agreements may include penalties for early termination these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses our customers could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future in addition the pricing and other terms of certain services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these contracts which may increase as services become more customized could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable as a result we may not generate the revenues profits or cash flows we may have anticipated from our services business within the expected timelines if at all 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract hire retain train motivate develop and deploy qualified executives engineers technical staff and other key employees identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the technology industry can be intense equitybased compensation is essential for attracting and retaining qualified employees and lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees in addition workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and we may not be able to manage changing workforce dynamics successfully moreover changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent globally further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and we may be unable to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees or successfully execute succession plans 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent changes of control of hp judged as undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and controlling the procedures for our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors these provisions could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management or limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock 

our aspirations and disclosures related to environmental social and governance “esg” matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance 

we have established and publicly announced esg goals including our commitments to address climate change human rights and digital equity these statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them our failure to adequately update accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation financial performance and growth and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community special interest groups and enforcement authorities 

our ability to achieve any esg objective is subject to numerous risks many of which are outside of our control examples of such risks include the availability and cost of low or noncarbonbased energy sources the evolving regulatory requirements affecting product circularity esg standards or disclosures the evolving consumer protection laws applicable to esg matters and the availability of materials and suppliers that can meet our sustainability diversity and other esg goals 

standards for tracking and reporting esg matters continue to evolve our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of others methodologies for reporting esg data may be updated and previously reported esg data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of thirdparty data changing assumptions changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances our processes and controls for reporting esg matters across our operations and supply chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying measuring and reporting esg metrics including esgrelated disclosures that may be required by the sec european and other regulators and such standards may change over time which could result in significant revisions to our current goals reported progress in achieving such goals or ability to achieve such goals in the future if our esg practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards then our reputation or our attractiveness as an investment business partner acquiror service provider or employer could be negatively impacted 

legal and regulatory risks 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted and changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or increased restrictions or prohibiting them outright in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product repairability reuse and takeback legislation in addition there are existing and proposed legislation related to environmental and social responsibility including forced labor tracing requirements for our operations supply chain partners and our products and services moreover we are expected to become increasingly subject to laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements or more prescriptive reporting requirements 

as these new laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions sanctions or other penalties including fines such burdens or costs may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we could also face significant compliance and operational burdens and incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with or rectify noncompliance with these laws or regulations our potential exposure also includes thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault 

we are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition commercial ip employment and other issues on a global basis there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment including but not limited to employment and patentmonetization claims in the united states and litigation and regulatory matters focused on consumer protection privacy and competition regulation globally as described in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters that may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations if decided adversely to or settled by us litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings have occurred and may occur including awards of monetary damages imposition of fines issuance of injunctions or ceaseanddesist orders directing us to cease engaging in certain business practices cease manufacturing or selling certain products requiring the compulsory licensing of patents or requiring other remedies in addition regardless of the outcome litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management 

failure to comply with our customer and partner contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to procurement regulations contract provisions and other specific requirements relating to their formation administration and performance in addition contracts with customers may also include a requirement to comply with customer codes of conduct which may have terms that conflict with our code of conduct business policies and strategic objectives any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in loss of business or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer our partner contracts also contain terms relating to new partner business models and tools creation that could raise issues for which laws or regulations are currently changing or emerging this could affect us in ways that are not currently fully known or measurable 

changes in our tax provisions adverse tax audits the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and approximately 60 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that the positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and we believe we have provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions pension and related interest we adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable we may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows 

our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement in addition changes in tax law and regulation in the us or elsewhere could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example the us congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals and while the final form of any legislation is uncertain the current proposals if enacted could have a material effect on the company’s effective tax rate our effective tax rate could also be materially affected by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s the european commission’s and other certain major jurisdictions’ heightened interest in and taxation of large multinational companies in addition we continue to monitor the inflation reduction act of 2022 and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business tax rate and financial results 

risks related to the separation 

we continue to face risks related to the separation including failure to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation and related to shared use of certain intellectual property rights 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise entered a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements the separation and distribution agreement provides for crossindemnities between hp and hewlett packard enterprise for liabilities allocated to the respective party pursuant to the terms of such agreement if hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities including spun off businesses to which obligations have been transferred are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses 

in addition the terms of the separation include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and we retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp 

branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect our reputation

• in personal systems our strategic focus is on 

◦ profitable growth through innovation market segmentation and simplification of our portfolio 

◦ enhanced innovation in multioperating systems multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes 

◦ investing in endpoint services and solutions we are focused on services including device as a service as the market begins to shift to contractual solutions and accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as peripherals and 

◦ driving innovation to enable productivity and collaboration with the pc becoming essential for hybrid work learn and play 

we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup along with our recent acquisitions in peripherals and remotecomputing solutions 

• in printing our strategic focus is on 

◦ offering innovative printing solutions and contractual solutions to serve consumers smbs and large enterprises through our instant ink services hp and managed print services solutions 

◦ providing digital printing solutions for graphics segments and applications including commercial publishing labels packaging and textiles and 

◦ expanding our footprint in 3d printing across digital manufacturing and strategic applications 

in addition to growing our subscription business we are also focused on rebalancing system profitability to more upfront profitable hardware sales through our product offerings including hp and big tank 

we are committed to growing our peripherals gaming workforce solutions consumer subscriptions 3d and industrial graphics businesses our ability to innovate is helping us gain momentum in growth areas like gaming and peripherals and we see significant opportunities to drive greater recurring revenues across personal systems and printing our acquisition of poly adds to our growth portfolio by bringing industryleading video conferencing solutions cameras headsets voice and software capabilities to drive more integration across our commercial services software and security portfolio we have created a new workforce services and solutions organization we continue to build on strong portfolios like instant ink to grow our consumer subscription business in industrial graphics we are driving the shift from analog to digital in segments like labels and packaging in personalization  3d we are creating endtoend solutions that can capture more value with our differentiated technology 

we continue to experience challenges that are representative of the trends and uncertainties that may affect our industry generally and our business and financial results specifically and we expect these challenges to continue in the shortterm one set of challenges relates to the current macroeconomic environment and the adverse impact on demand for certain of our products and product mix a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape with increasing online and omnichannel presence additional challenges we face at the segment level and that we expect to continue facing in the shortterm are set forth below 

• in personal systems we face challenges with competitive pricing environment supply shortages in certain parts of business elevated commodity and logistics costs compared to prepandemic levels we are also experiencing softness in demand resulting in overall decline in personal systems market 

• in printing we face challenges from a competitive environment including nonoriginal supplies which includes imitation refill or remanufactured alternatives and we face component constraints which we expect to continue to negatively impact our financial performance in the short term we also obtain many printing components from single

source due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for instance we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of our a3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes analytics efficiencies and simplification of our product portfolio we also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals improving channel execution and inventory production and backlog management strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus effective cost management strengthening our pricing discipline and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities 

macroeconomic environment 

our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions we face global macroeconomic challenges particularly in light of the effects of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in ukraine tensions across the taiwan strait the covid19 pandemic tariffdriven headwinds uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates inflationary trends and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment throughout fiscal 2022 we observed significant market uncertainty increasing inflationary pressures supply constraints and a strengthening us dollar as well as ongoing effects from the covid19 pandemic these market dynamics which we expect will continue in the shortterm have created new and different demand dynamics in our markets and have had significant impacts on our financial results 

while our personal systems business benefited from the hybrid work environment and growth in gaming driven by the covid19 pandemic these trends and consumer behavior have started to change as a result of various macroeconomic factors including but not limited to inflation foreign currency and lower consumer spending beginning third quarter of fiscal 2022 we observed an accelerated decline in consumer demand particularly with respect to consumer pcs this decline in demand is in line with industrywide declines and we expect this to continue for fiscal 2023 for the fiscal year 2022 we continued to see strong demand in windowsbased commercial pcs and mix shifts from low end to premium products however we anticipate the overall macroeconomic environment to continue to adversely impact the demand for commercial pcs in the shortterm in printing we continued to see gradual and uneven recovery in commercial print driven by the slow return of workers to the office and softening of demand in consumer print which accelerated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 also we experienced an increasingly competitive pricing environment in the second half of fiscal 2022 which we expect to continue in the shortterm due to the macroeconomic environment across personal systems and printing further our operating margins were negatively impacted by the higher cost due to inflationary pressures in fiscal 2023 we expect decline in both personal systems and printing market compared to fiscal 2022 

supply chain dynamics have impacted and we expect will continue to impact logistics and component costs at least in the short term with logistics costs remaining elevated for the fiscal year as a result of both expedited shipments of components and overall rate costs in the freight network while capacity improved in the second half of fiscal 2022 additionally we expect industry wide commodity and component constraints including application specific integrated circuits “asics” that are unique to our products in personal systems and printing to continue to impact our businesses in the shortterm we continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic and variants of the coronavirus as well as the impact the pandemic has on our employees customers business partners and communities we have experienced and may experience future disruptions in supply manufacturing and logistics particularly in asia and with our suppliers and outsourcing partners globally as a result of covid19 

in addition to the macroeconomic dynamics we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have a large global presence with more than 65 of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 coming from outside the united states as a result our financial results can be and particularly in recent periods have been impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to negatively impact our financial results in the fiscal 2023 

on may 31 2022 we announced our decision to wind down business operations in russia having already suspended all new shipments and paused our marketing and advertising activities in february 2022 russia contributed approximately 10 billion of total net revenue in fiscal 2021 in the second half of fiscal 2022 we recognized a charge of 23 million towards severance cancellation of contracts inventory writedowns and other onetime exit charges related to our decision a significant escalation or expansion of the situation’s current scope could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows or financial position we continue to be focused on the safety and security of our employees and their families in the impacted regions and we have provided and expect to continue to provide grants to support ukrainian relief efforts

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

we typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by supply constraints shifts in customer behavior continuing impacts of the macroeconomic challenges and different demand dynamics 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i in this annual report on form 10k 

transformation update

critical accounting policies and estimates   

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states “us” generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of october 31 2022 the impact to our business from the changing macroeconomic factors continued to unfold additionally hp continues to assess and evaluate impacts from the events in russia inflationary concerns as well as certain supply chain disruptions as a result many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available our estimates may change in future periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp’s board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 “overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we evaluate customers’ ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience financial metrics and customer credit scores 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions there are contracts which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of performance obligations that are distinct the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations 

we evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents distinct goods or services a performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract 

transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer if the transaction price includes a variable amount we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method we reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns we use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on historical experience expected consumer behavior and market conditions 

when a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations such as hardware andor services we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price the selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price “ssp” we establish ssp using the price charged for a performance obligation when 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

sold separately “observable price” and in some instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority when observable price is not available we establish ssp based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement in most arrangements with multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price 

revenue is recognized when or as a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer we generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms for fixedprice support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of standready obligations payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the duration of the contract in instances when revenue is derived from sales of thirdparty vendor products or services we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor we consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty obligation may be required 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit credit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount

rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit credit cost for fiscal year 2022 



taxes on earnings 

as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2029 

material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 60 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions pension and related interest we adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable we may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our provision for taxes net earnings and cash flows for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand ageing of inventory technological changes supply constraints product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent third parties to perform an appraisal when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment may include changes in business climate market conditions or other events impacting the reporting unit if we determine an impairment is more likely than not based on our qualitative assessment a quantitative assessment of impairment is performed 

performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include among others revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables if we determine the carrying amount exceeds fair value goodwill is impaired and the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property “ip” commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” are not a meaningful indicator of hp’s potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2022 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations   

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplement the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue with the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which excludes the effect of foreign currency 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly exchange rates from the comparative period and excluding any hedging impact recognized in the current period and without adjusting for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results the constant currency measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



  

net revenue 

in fiscal year 2022 total net revenue decreased 08 increased 07 on a constant currency basis as compared to the prioryear period net revenue from the united states decreased 34 to 217 billion and outside of the united states increased 06 to 413 billion the decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts decline in supplies notebooks and consumer printing partially offset by an increase in desktops workstations and other personal systems the decrease was driven by unit decline partially offset by higher average selling prices “asps” units were down in both personal systems and printing due to supply chain constraints and demand softness primarily in the second half of fiscal 2022 driven by the macroeconomic environment including inflationary trends

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rate was 279 in fiscal year 2022 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to impacts of internal reorganization and favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were singapore malaysia and puerto rico 

for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 in fiscal year 2022 and further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

commercial pcs revenue increased 105 primarily driven by higher asps and unit growth in desktops and workstations partially offset by unit decline in notebooks due to lower chromebooks consumer pcs net revenue decreased 127 driven by unit declines in notebooks partially offset by higher asps 

consequently net revenue increased 144 in desktops 258 in workstations and decreased 44 in notebooks 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 06 percentage points primarily due to a decrease in gross margin partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue the gross margin decrease was primarily due to the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives in the prioryear period higher costs including commodity costs and foreign currency impacts partially offset by disciplined pricing and mix shifts operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 08 percentage points primarily driven by last year’s increased rd investments lower variable compensation and joint partner funding

fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 

printing net revenue decreased 61 decreased 55 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prioryear period the decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in supplies consumer and unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by growth in commercial net revenue for supplies decreased 69 primarily driven by consumer demand weakness continued normalization in home printing and the decision to wind down business operations in russia partially offset by the gradual recovery in industrial print printer unit volume decreased 154 and asps increased 104 the decrease in printer unit volume was primarily driven by decreases in both consumer and commercial due to component availability and supply chain disruptions printer asps increased primarily due to disciplined pricing and mix shifts partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

net revenue for commercial increased by 04 primarily due to a 77 increase in asps partially offset by an 80 decrease in printer unit volume the increase in asps was primarily driven by disciplined pricing and mix shifts partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

net revenue for consumer decreased 113 primarily due to a 165 decrease in printer unit volume partially offset by 59 increase in asps the increase in asps was primarily driven by disciplined pricing 

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 12 percentage points for fiscal year 2022 primarily due to lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset by a decrease in gross margin the decrease in gross margin was driven by lower supplies mix and higher commodity and supply chain costs partially offset by disciplined pricing further gross margin was impacted by component shortages and supply chain disruptions which impacted mix and unit availability for both commercial and consumer operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower variable compensation and gotomarket initiative expenses

on september 1 2022 we consummated our exchange offer and consent solicitation the approximately 05 billion in aggregate principal amount of our new notes mature in 2029 the “2029 notes” and an aggregate amount of 8 million in consent fee was paid in connection therewith in addition under the terms of the 2029 notes we are obligated to within 60 days after the consummation of our acquisition of poly offer to purchase all or a portion of the 2029 notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date 

on october 19 2022 we commenced the change of control offer for the 2029 notes on november 17 2022 we consummated the change of control offer and paid an aggregate amount of approximately 498 million in connection therewith to repurchase the approximately 488 million of notes tendered on november 21 2022 we issued a notice of redemption to redeem the remaining approximately 3 million of the 2029 notes 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the us repatriations of amounts held outside the us generally will not be taxable from a us federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax upon repatriation as we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds including reducing our gross debt level or other uses

working capital management activities reduction in receivables from contract manufacturers and payment of employee variable compensation accrued in the prioryear period 

key working capital metrics 

management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level the table below presents the cash conversion cycle 



the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms and timing extent of receivables factoring macroeconomic factors seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for credit losses by a 90day average of net revenue the decrease in dso as compared to prioryear period was due to higher factoring partially offset by unfavorable revenue linearity 

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold the increase in dos was primarily due to lower cost of revenue and higher inventory for assurance of supply in printing partially offset by consumption of commodities in personal systems 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold the increase in dpo as compared to prioryear period was primarily due to payment timing partially offset by lower purchasing volumes

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 39 billion in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to higher proceeds from debt issuance of 21 billion lower share repurchases of 20 billion and lower payment of debt of 06 billion partially offset by commercial paper activity of 08 billion

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

shortterm debt decreased by 09 billion and longterm debt increased by 44 billion for fiscal year 2022 as compared to prioryear period the net increase in total debt was primarily due to issuance of unsecured senior debt amounting to 40 billion during the year and exchange offer of 05 billion related to poly notes which was partially offset by payment of 05 billion towards redemption of existing notes maturing in september 2022 and commercial paper payments of 04 billion 

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 10 “financial instruments” in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” which is incorporated herein by reference 

for more information on the new notes and the redemption of existing notes see note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which is incorporated herein by reference 

as of october 31 2022 we maintained the 5year sustainabilitylinked senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of 50 billion which will be available until may 26 2026 funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 

available borrowing resources 

as of october 31 2022 we had available borrowing resources of 937 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to the revolving credit facility 

the amendment to our 2019 shelf registration statement to convert to a nonautomatic shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february 25 2021 and as of october 31 2022 enables us to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings 10 billion in the aggregate of debt securities common stock preferred stock depository shares and warrants the 2019 shelf registration statement will expire in december 2022 around which time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information they obtain during our ongoing discussions while we currently do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt a downgrade from our current credit rating may increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facility reduce market capacity for our commercial paper require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts and may have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position depending on the extent of such downgrade see “risk factors— failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference we can access alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facility if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual and other obligations 

our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2022 were as follows 



1 amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our shortterm and longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments discounts or premiums 

2 amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our shortterm and longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our us dollar global notes to variable interest rates the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31 2022 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt 

3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

4 retirement and postretirement benefit plan contributions in fiscal year 2023 we expect to contribute approximately 36 million to nonus pension plans 32 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants and 4 million to cover benefit claims for our postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution required by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions and payments to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

5 cost savings plans as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect to make future cash payments of approximately 08 billion we expect to make future cash payments of 04 billion in fiscal year 2023 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2025 these payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments for more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements see note 3 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

6 uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2022 we had approximately 605 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities for more information on our uncertain tax positions see note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in over 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2022 were euro chinese yuan renminbi japanese yen and british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent in cost of sales in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2022 and 2021 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2022 and 2021 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchang e l oss of 134 million and 168 million at october 31 2022 and october 31 2021 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we may use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve a floating interest expense andor us dollar principal outflows the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability in interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2022 and 2021 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2022 and 2021 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 210 million at october 31 2022 and 73 million at october 31 2021

corporate investments 

corporate investments includes hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two including 

• retailers that sell our products to the public focusing on consumers and small and mediumsized businesses 

• resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups 

• distribution partners that supply our products and solutions to resellers and 

• system integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services including systems integration work and asaservice solutions and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services 

the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market we believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and subgeographic specificities for each of our businesses we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers for other customers and for consumers we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and smbs and commercial resellers mainly targeting smbs and midmarket accounts 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers “oms” around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand additionally we manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing or readily available alternate sources of supply however we have relied on sole sources for some laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations mitigating the effect of a disruption for instance we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of a3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party not to renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net 

revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft and google for various software products we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see “risk factors—we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the information technology “it” industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see “risk factors—we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products we strive to make our products in an ethical and sustainable manner we have committed to building an efficient resilient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations such as supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers’ demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce this provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products we believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus on diversity and inclusion gives us a solid base on which to build future growth 

research and development 

innovation across products services business models and processes is a key element of our culture and success our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see “risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2021 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 28000 patents 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is essential to hp as a whole or to any of hp’s business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property “ip” from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see “risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop obtain license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” “risk factors—our products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties” and “risk factors—thirdparty claims 

of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by increasing supply constraints shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of the covid19 pandemic see “risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service support and solutions including subscriptionbased offerings and financing security availability of application software and our sustainability performance 

the markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments 

the competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below 

personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions our primary competitors are lenovo group limited dell inc huawei technologies co ltd acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation microsoft corporation and samsung electronics co ltd in particular geographies we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or “white box” manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our innovative design work our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing  the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products our primary competitors include canon inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation ltd seiko epson corporation the ricoh company ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer nonoriginal supplies including imitation refill and remanufactured alternatives which are often available for lower prices but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to hp original inkjet and toner supplies these and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers or distributors or such resellers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost nonoriginal supplies our competitive advantages include our comprehensive highquality solutions for the home office and publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features sustainability our brand and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products and their safe use 

we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account among other things published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment 

we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as “product takeback legislation” we are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption carbon emissions reusing or recycling we intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future period s 

strategic and operational risks 

our business results of operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in a curtailment of business activities including changes in demand for a broad variety of goods and services weakened economic conditions disruptions in supply manufacturing and logistics economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets both in the united states and abroad 

the covid19 pandemic including its resurgence in key markets has impacted and could adversely impact our operations and financial performance covid19 related restrictions impacted the demand for certain products and services as a result of temporary closures of offices and businesses the shift to a hybrid work environment and as people moved to spend more time at home which negatively impacted sales for commercial products in both personal systems and print for as long as remote working and learning practices remain prevalent whether due to restrictions implemented by governmental authorities or businesses allowing employees to continue to work remotely or adopting new workplace models we expect decreased sales of products for inoffice consumption in some markets and channels compared to prepandemic levels while this decrease in demand for certain products has been partially offset by increased sales of other products for inhome consumption compared to prepandemic levels we are unable to predict for how long or to what extent this elevated level of sales of products for inhome consumption will continue additionally as the market continues to shift to hybrid our financial performance will depend in part on our ability to remain competitive in products designed for hybrid consumption 

moreover our channel partners have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in their operations due to restrictions implemented in response to covid19 which has caused and may continue to cause reduced or cancelled orders andor collection risks this has further adversely impacted our results of operations and we expect it may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations 

additionally as the covid19 pandemic continues and new variants of the virus emerge we are seeing a resurgence of the pandemic in certain key markets we have experienced temporary factory closures and other disruptions in supply manufacturing and logistics as a result of covid19 and we may continue to experience such disruptions for example our manufacturing sites including those in asia as well as those of our suppliers and outsourcing partners were adversely impacted as a result of quarantines facility closures and travel and logistics challenges these disruptions have resulted and may continue to result in supply shortages and delays impacting sales worldwide for both personal systems and print as well as incremental costs we may experience further disruptions in the future and any prolonged disruptions to our manufacturing operations supply chain andor distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are also facing increased operational challenges as we take measures to support and protect employee health and safety including limiting employee travel limiting access to facilities and offices implementing remote work and flexible work policies and implementing a vaccine policy for employees in particular our remote work arrangements pose challenges for our employees and our it systems and extended periods of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including cybersecurity and it systems management risks and impair our ability to manage our business in addition complying with various customer or government vaccine masking or testing requirements could result in increased competition for skilled talent and could adversely impact our ability to deliver services to our customers which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations or financial performance 

the effects of covid19 may also limit the resources afforded to or delay the implementation of our strategic initiatives and make it more difficult to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services if our strategic initiatives are delayed or otherwise modified such initiatives may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ultimate impact of covid19 on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic including the impact of variants and resurgences the development availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines governmental business 

and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic general economic uncertainty in global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides 

further covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this report any of which could materially adversely impact our business we also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of covid19 on economic and market conditions covid19 may also affect our business and financial results in ways that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider as significant risks to our operations 

we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results 

we are operating in a supplyconstrained environment and are facing and may continue to face component shortages logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our revenues and profitability we are heavily dependent on thirdparty suppliers and their ability to deliver sufficient quantities of key components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet schedules for the delivery of our products and services in addition our operations depend on our ability to anticipate and our suppliers’ ability to fulfill our needs for sufficient quantities of key components products and services including sourcing matched sets given the wide variety of products and services we offer the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems have and could continue to arise in production planning and inventory management and regulatory compliance that could seriously harm our business thirdparty suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations due to the international nature of our thirdparty supplier network our financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers increased tariffs and localization requirements which could increase the cost or availability of certain components products and services that we may not be able to offset we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit or if any of our distributors lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers “oms” may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs jeopardizing our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations which could in turn result in a decrease in sales and profitability contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers risks related to supply chain working conditions human rights and materials sourcing and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 

• component shortages we have and may continue to experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems we face during the transition to new suppliers for example we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain during the covid19 pandemic which have resulted in temporary supply shortages that have negatively affected our ability to fulfill demand for personal systems and printing products worldwide and resulted in increases in prices for certain components and we expect such challenges to continue during 2022 for example there is currently a market shortage of integrated circuits and panels and other component supply which has affected and could continue to affect lead times the cost of that supply and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure sufficient supply in a timely manner or on terms that are acceptable additionally our personal systems business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture our products and we are therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to manufacture our products to fulfill demand we represent a substantial portion of the business for certain oms and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving component products from that om if shortages or delays in component products persist the price of certain components may increase further we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are 

unable to pass on price increases to our customers due to such component shortages or delays if we cannot adequately address a component supply issue we may have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

• excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services we have and may continue to make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and may be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our personal systems business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition in order to secure components we may accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us any of these developments could adversely affect our future cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to effectively manage this workforce could adversely affect our results of operations our ability to manage the costs associated with engaging a contingent workforce may be impacted by evolving local labor rights laws 

• working conditions human rights and materials sourcing  our brand perception customer loyalty and legal compliance could be adversely impacted by a supplier’s improper practices or failure to comply with our requirements for environmentally socially or legally responsible practices and sourcing including those in our supplier code of conduct general specification for the environment or other related provisions in our procurement contracts these provisions include supplier audits reporting of smelters human rights due diligence wood fiber certification and ghg emissions water and waste data 

• singlesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from a single source due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges we also rely on both intel and amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for the majority of our pcs and workstations some of those processors may be customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained initially from only one source until we have determined whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components alternative sources may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in certain circumstances we purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of deterioration of our relationship with or limits in allocation by a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is to strengthen our core businesses innovate and develop new products services and solutions expand into adjacencies and grow organically and inorganically to execute our strategy we must among other things optimize our cost structure make longterm investments develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property commit significant research and development and other resources evolve our gotomarket strategy and printing business model to meet changing market dynamics forces and demand as well as innovate develop and execute on evolutionary strategies in a rapidly changing and increasingly hybrid environment seize on disruptive opportunities and effectively respond to secular trends and shifts in customer preferences as the market continues to shift to hybrid our financial performance will depend in part on our ability to remain competitive in offerings geared towards hybrid consumption any failure to successfully execute our strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently or prioritize research and development in strategic growth areas accurately predict technological or business trends and control costs of research and development could adversely affect adoption of our products services and solutions and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

moreover the process of developing new hightechnology products services and solutions and enhancing existing products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate or respond to customers’ changing needs or the timing of those needs and emerging technological trends accurately could affect our market share cash flows results of operations and financial condition in addition our ability to successfully offer our products services and solutions in this rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively calibrate and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization for example we may adjust production levels in response to demand fluctuations and in order to improve the alignment of our resources to business conditions 

our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies including those created by our competitors may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhancement of our existing products and technologies or develop new ones as a result we could fail to maintain market leadership in certain of our products such as commercial pcs and notebooks and any of our products and technologies may be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 

after we develop a product we must be able to quickly manufacture appropriate volumes while also managing costs and preserving or improving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed in doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable the operating margins may not be as high as the historical or anticipated margins 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments in addition we are expanding into new disruptive and competitive businesses such as services we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings and our sustainability performance if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations cash flows and business prospects could be affected 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available for their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services or greater economies of scale which could in turn result in our inability to maintain market leadership in certain of our products such as commercial pcs and notebooks 

our alliance partners in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in others in addition these partners also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we have faced and may continue to face aggressive price competition and may have to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions andor more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products and services we may spend a proportionately greater percentage of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is negative reception to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product the financial performance of that product could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming 

obsolete financial performance could also decline due to increased competition from other types of products services or solutions for example nonoriginal supplies including imitation refill or remanufactured alternatives which are often available at lower prices compete with our printing supplies business and we may not be able to prevent the use of imitation print supplies with our printers using technological protection measures 

customers are increasingly using online and omnichannel retailers resellers and distributors to purchase our products these retailers resellers and distributors often sell our products alongside competing products including nonoriginal supplies or they may highlight the availability of lower cost nonoriginal supplies we expect this competition will continue and it may negatively impact our financial performance particularly if large commercial customers purchase competing products instead of hp products 

if we cannot continue to produce highquality and secure products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services including potential defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes unsatisfactory performance under service contracts and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in thirdparty components included in our products including security vulnerabilities in order to address quality and security issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement effective solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors particularly with respect to undiscovered defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties 

if we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality or security issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability we have and may again in the future write off some or all of the value of nonperforming inventory in addition after products are delivered quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing these issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance in the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with thirdparty components we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation such as firmware updates furthermore these mitigation techniques may be ineffective or may result in adverse performance system instability and data loss or corruption and are not always available on a timely or cost effective basis or at all if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and we have faced and could potentially continue to face legal claims if we fail to meet our customers’ expectations in addition quality and security issues including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in thirdparty components can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition  

our operating results have historically varied and may not be indicative of future results 

our net revenue gross margin profit and cash flow generation vary among our portfolio of products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely continue to vary in future periods overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers increased tariffs component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may also have a significant impact on our overall gross margin profitability and cash flow in addition newer geographic markets can be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs increased tariffs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations for example our supplies business has experienced declining revenues due to declines in installed base and usage our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period these factors could also make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to suppliers and manufacturers manage our relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing our global multitier distribution network including the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins any failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability and cash flows 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or reduced assortments of our products if we are not able to limit the potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners or we fail to optimize the use of our pricing programs moreover some of our distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends they may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors’ financial conditions abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges and factoring in supply chain challenges and order cancellations resulting from any pricing increases our forecasts may not accurately predict demand and distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods including a multitiered channel may reduce our visibility into inventories demand and pricing trends and issues and may therefore make forecasting and managing multitiered channel inventory more difficult 

if we were to expand direct distribution initiatives channel and indirect distributors could consider such initiatives in conflict with their business interests and reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of our products or cease all sales of our products sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products has and could continue to make our forecasting and channel inventory management more difficult and impact pricing in the market for example in the past we have had channel partners sell products outside of their agreed territory and misrepresent sales to unauthorized resellers as sales to endusers frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory or maintain consistent pricing and negatively impacting gross margins moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors in addition factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing 

in addition we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent they fail to do so such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages supply disruptions or logistics challenges could adversely impact our inventory levels our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience seasonal trends in the sale of our products that may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter due in part to seasonal holiday demand and typically it has been our strongest quarter by revenues european sales are often weaker during 

the summer months demand during the spring and early summer may also be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends however historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and such patterns have been and may continue to be impacted by increasing supply constraints shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of the covid19 pandemic moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margins many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

we may not be able to execute acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business risks associated with these transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability cash flows and financial condition 

• we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of any particular transaction in the timeframe we expected or at all such transaction may be less profitable than anticipated or unprofitable we may not identify all factors to estimate accurately our costs timing or other matters and realizing the benefits of a particular transaction may depend upon competition market trends additional costs or investments and the actions of advisors suppliers or other third parties 

• certain transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to compensation and benefit costs goodwill and impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

• our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal controls including as a result of being dependent on the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties 

• in order to finance a transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution or borrow additional debt 

• these transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate 

• these transactions may lead to litigation 

• if we fail to identify successfully complete and integrate transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage 

if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include impairment charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience fewer synergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in jurisdictions around the world and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay or prevent the transaction 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

to pursue our strategy successfully we have to identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integrations involve significant challenges and are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business these challenges include successfully combining product and service offerings entering or expanding into markets retaining key employees integrating employees facilities technology products processes operations including supply and manufacturing operations sales and distribution channels business models and business systems and retaining customers and distributors 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring plans in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs for example we began implementing the 2020 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to complete the restructuring by the end of fiscal 2022 implementation of any restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be 

able to obtain the estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all or obtain the cost savings and operational improvements that were initially anticipated we currently plan to invest a portion of the savings from our 2020 restructuring plan across our businesses including investing to build our digital capabilities if we are unable to obtain the anticipated cost savings our ability to make those investments realize operational improvements and execute our strategy may be negatively impacted additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency loss of key employees andor other retention issues during transitional periods restructuring can require a significant amount of time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our 2020 restructuring plan see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop obtain license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property “ip” laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain ip rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however our ip rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such ip rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example the enforcement of our ip rights for inkjet printer supplies against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip rights may be successfully circumvented in addition we may choose to not apply for patent protection or may fail to apply for patent protection in a timely fashion further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the ip assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation also include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of ip in the existing operations of both businesses as a result of the allocation of ip as part of the separation we no longer own ip allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting ip ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent and trademark enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets 

our products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties 

certain of our businesses and products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our ip thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our ip without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition cash flows and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our ip rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these ip rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights finally we may rely on third parties to enforce certain ip rights 

thirdparty claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties have in the past claimed and may in the future claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their ip rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase ip assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements and we have seen trends towards assertions of patents originally assigned to operating companies with significant rd investments and patents asserted against standardsbased technology if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed ip at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that ip claims are without merit they can be 

timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business claims of ip infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlements or license agreements pay damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual obligations to us additionally claims of ip infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships 

our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from us levies upon it equipment such as pcs and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us some european countries are expected to implement legislation to introduce or extend existing levy schemes to digital devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by legislative bodies and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price 

we are exposed to attacks from individuals and organizations including malicious computer programmers and hackers statesponsored organizations nationstates or other bad actors seeking to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns such attacks may involve the deployment of viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords other sensitive information or provide access to our systems or data in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects or vulnerabilities in design or manufacture including “bugs” that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the product breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harm our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our ip or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business additionally the costs to combat cyber or other security threats can be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security regardless of their immediacy or accuracy could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business while we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security threats such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches moreover these threats are constantly evolving thereby making it more difficult to successfully defend against them or to implement adequate preventative measures we may not have the current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow those vulnerabilities to persist in our systems over long periods of time in the past we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to or use of our systems or those of third parties which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impact will not be material in the future as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface we have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume frequency and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces our products and services are potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats 

because we process proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of such data can expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss alteration or misuse of such information a breach could also damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business and could result in government enforcement actions litigation and potential liability for us for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” imposes a data protection compliance regime with severe penalties and china has recently adopted new privacy and security laws in the united states california has adopted and several other states are now considering adopting laws and regulations imposing varying obligations regarding the handling of personal data which could result in increased compliance costs additionally we could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing new data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure including those provided by third parties may experience interruptions outages delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations migration work or other causes which could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive than planned such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly 

the risks that accompany our services businesses differ from those of our other businesses for example the success of our services business such as our managed print services digital services and other workforce solutions in both printing and personal systems depends to a significant degree on attracting retaining and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from our customers our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option andor subject to cancellation rights with or without penalties for early termination we may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our customers or our customers may reduce the scope of the services they contract for factors that may influence contract termination nonrenewal or reduction include business downturns dissatisfaction with our services or products our retirement or lack of support for our services our customers selecting alternative technologies the cost of our services as compared to our competitors general market conditions or other reasons we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost customers or reductions in services while our services agreements may include penalties for early termination these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses our customers could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future in addition the pricing and other terms of certain services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these contracts which may increase as services become more customized could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the product margin of our services business as a result we may not generate the revenues profits or cash flows we may have anticipated from our services business within the expected timelines if at all 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract hire retain train motivate develop and deploy qualified executives engineers technical staff and other key employees identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the technology industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and key employees we must provide competitive compensation including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs or fail to grant equity competitively or equitably or if the anticipated value of equitybased incentive awards do not materialize or equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit we may have difficulty attracting and retaining top talent there may also be a risk that we will be unable to achieve our diversity equity and inclusion objectives which could adversely impact our workplace culture and our ability to hire and retain talent as well damage our reputation with stockholders customers and other stakeholders additionally changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent globally a failure to successfully hire or retain top talent could have a significant impact on our business continuity and operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations moreover as social and economic conditions evolve due to the covid19 pandemic current and prospective employees may seek new or different opportunities based on factors such as benefits mobility and flexibility that are different from what we offer making it difficult to attract and retain talent 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent changes of control of hp judged as undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for 

election to our board of directors and controlling the procedures for our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors 

these provisions could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management or limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock 

macroeconomic industry and financial risks 

global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete ongoing economic weakness uncertainty in markets throughout the world and other adverse economic conditions including inflation have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings growth rates or cash flows and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels and accurately forecasting revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services political developments impacting international trade trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the united states and china may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions or drive political or national sentiment weakening demand for our products and services 

prolonged or more severe economic weakness and uncertainty could also cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments there is uncertainty regarding the timing of the discontinuation modification or reform of libor and other interest rate benchmarks and the implementation of alternative reference rates including the secured overnight financing rate or sofr any such discontinuation modification or reform could result in an increase in our interest expense or make our interest expense more volatile economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately 65 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2021 came from outside the united states in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations changes or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy actual or anticipated military or political conflicts health emergencies or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or brexit and its impact 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers 

• the imposition by governments of additional taxes tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the united states and other countries including china 

• trade and other policies laws and regulations affecting production shipping pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by the united states or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors or other country localization requirements 

• political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade including the willingness of nonus consumers to purchase goods or services from us corporations 

• managing a geographically dispersed workforce and local labor conditions and regulations including labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers “oems” or changes to immigration and labor law which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent 

• changes or uncertainty in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments including tax laws and antitrust laws 

• differing technology standards customer requirements or levels of protection of intellectual property 

• import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular 

countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

• stringent privacy and data protection policies such as the gdpr 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws and adverse consequences such as fines or other penalties for any failure to comply and 

• fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points for our products and shipments 

the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states and our supply chain for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars global economic events including trade disputes economic sanctions and emerging market volatility and the resulting uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate which may contribute to variations in sales of our products and services in impacted jurisdictions because a majority of our revenues are generated outside the united states fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states from time to time we may use forward contracts andor options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks our hedging strategies may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition cash flows and to a lesser extent our cost of sales 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue cash flows and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures manufacturing equipment failures cybersecurity incidents power or water shortages natural disasters fires extreme weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise such as those described in “climate change may have a longterm impact on our business” below medical epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured terrorist acts conflicts or wars for which we are predominantly uninsured may also disrupt our worldwide operations the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability cash flows and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain andor result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations that may be vulnerable to such natural disasters we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into north and south america our operations and those of our significant suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason such as those described above or other economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political reasons the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers our distributors and our general infrastructure which may be located near areas more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions and which is consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their orders or these events could otherwise result in a decrease in demand for our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever our business is conducted changes in market dynamics stakeholder expectations local national and international climate change policies and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the united states and abroad all have the potential to disrupt our business and operations such events could result in a significant increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue cash flows and financial performance global climate change is resulting and may continue to result in certain natural disasters and adverse weather such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding occurring more frequently or with greater intensity which could cause business disruptions and impact employees’ abilities to commute or to work from home effectively for example the increasing intensity of droughts wildfires or extreme weather conditions at our office locations increase the 

probability of planned power outages government failure to address climate change in line with the paris agreement could result in greater exposure to economic and other risks from climate change and impact our ability to achieve our climate goals in addition failure or perception of failure to achieve our goals including as a result of governmental inaction with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change could lead to adverse publicity resulting in an adverse effect on our business or damage to our reputation 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies past downgrades of hewlettpackard company’s ratings increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and reduced market capacity for our commercial paper future downgrades could have the same effect and could also require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition to our current total debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt level and related debt service obligations could have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures dividend repayments acquisitions and other general corporate purposes our indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions we may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service obligations debt refinancing future acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes which will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control and could be adversely impacted by our debt level consequently we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all which could adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

we have adopted a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time even if our share repurchase program is fully implemented it may not enhance longterm stockholder value also the amount timing and execution of our share repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock  

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report for example we make significant estimates and assumptions when accounting for revenue recognition taxes on earnings and restructuring and other charges in addition as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies we also estimate sales and marketing program incentives based on a number of factors including historical experience expected customer behavior and market conditions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

legal and regulatory risks 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or increased restrictions or prohibiting them outright in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product repairability reuse and takeback legislation in addition there are existing and proposed legislation related to environmental 

and social responsibility for our operations supply chain partners and our products and services noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in substantial costs or other penalties which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions we could also face significant compliance and operational burdens and incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with or rectify noncompliance with these laws or regulations such as privacy regulations in addition these laws or regulations could result in loss of market access or limit offerings in those markets such burdens or costs may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict moreover we are expected to become increasingly subject to laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements as these new laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines 

we are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition commercial ip employment and other issues on a global basis there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment including but not limited to employment and patentmonetization claims in the united states and litigation and regulatory matters focused on consumer protection privacy and competition regulation globally as described in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters that may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations if decided adversely to or settled by us litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings have occurred and may occur including awards of monetary damages imposition of fines issuance of injunctions or ceaseanddesist orders directing us to cease engaging in certain business practices cease manufacturing or selling certain products requiring the compulsory licensing of patents or requiring other remedies an unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in addition regardless of the outcome litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management 

failure to comply with our customer and partner contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to procurement regulations contract provisions and other specific requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts additionally some of our agreements with governmental customers may be subject to periodic funding approval funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer our partner contracts also contain terms relating to new partner business models and tools creation that could raise issues for which laws or regulations are currently changing or emerging this could affect us in ways that are not currently fully known or measurable 

changes in our tax provisions adverse tax audits the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and approximately 60 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that the positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and we believe we have provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions pension and related interest we adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable we may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows 

our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement in addition changes in tax law and regulation in the us or elsewhere could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example the us congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals and while the final form of any legislation is uncertain the current proposals if enacted could have a material effect on the company’s effective tax rate our effective tax rate could also be materially affected by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s the european commission’s and other certain major jurisdictions’ heightened interest in and taxation of large multinational companies 

risks related to the separation 

we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise entered a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements the separation and distribution agreement provides for crossindemnities between hp and hewlett packard enterprise for liabilities allocated to the respective party pursuant to the terms of such agreement if hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities including spun off businesses to which obligations have been transferred are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations

financial condition and results of operations continued 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices imaging and printing products and related technologies solutions and services we sell to individual consumers smbs and large enterprises including customers in the government health and education sectors we have three reportable segments personal systems printing and corporate investments the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook pcs workstations thin clients commercial mobility devices retail pos systems displays and peripherals software support and services the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware supplies solutions and services corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects 

• in personal systems our strategic focus is on profitable growth through innovation and market segmentation this focus is with respect to enhanced innovation in multioperating systems multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes additionally we are investing in endpoint services and solutions we are focused on services including device as a service as the market begins to shift to contractual solutions and accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as peripherals we are driving innovation to enable productivity and collaboration with the pc becoming essential for hybrid work learn and play we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup along with our recent acquisitions in peripherals and remotecomputing solutions 

• in printing our strategic focus is on offering contractual solutions to serve consumers smbs and large enterprises through our instant ink services hp and managed print services solutions providing digital printing solutions for graphics segments and applications including commercial publishing labels packaging and textiles as well as expanding our footprint in 3d printing across digital manufacturing and strategic applications 

we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends that may adversely impact our product mix a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape with increasing online and omnichannel presence additional challenges we face at the segment level are set forth below 

• in personal systems we face challenges with industry component availability which we expect to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand at least in the shortterm and a competitive environment 

• in printing we face challenges from a competitive environment including nonoriginal supplies which includes imitation refill or remanufactured alternatives and we face component constraints and other supply chain disruptions particularly in printer hardware which we expect to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand at least in the shortterm we also obtain many printing components from single source due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for instance we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of our a3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

in fiscal year 2022 we expect to see continued demand for both personal systems and printing we also anticipate that component shortages manufacturing disruptions and logistics challenges will continue to impact our revenues and margins 

our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions accordingly we face global macroeconomic challenges particularly in light of the effects of the covid19 pandemic as discussed below tariffdriven headwinds uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment the full impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time 

to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes analytics and efficiencies we also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals improving channel execution and inventory production and backlog management strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus strengthening our pricing discipline and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities 

in october 2019 we announced costreduction and operational efficiency initiatives intended to simplify the way we work move closer to our customers and facilitate specific investment in our business these were further updated in february 2020 these efforts included transforming our operating model to integrate our sales force into a single commercial organization and reducing structural costs across the company through our restructuring plan approved in september 2019 the

“fiscal 2020 plan” we have invested and expect to invest some of the savings from these efforts across our businesses including investing to build our digital capabilities over time we expect these investments will make us more efficient and allow us to advance our positions in personal systems and printing while also disrupting new industries where we see attractive medium to longterm growth opportunities however the rate at which we are able to invest in our business and the returns that we are able to achieve from these investments will be affected by many factors including the efforts to address the execution industry and macroeconomic challenges facing our business as discussed above as a result we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and the anticipated benefits of these efforts may not materialize 

in the second year of our program we continued to look at new cost savings opportunities and remained ahead of our 12 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction pla n in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 we completed the initial deployment of our sap s4 hana system one of the largest erp implementations also as part of our endtoend business planning and forecasting efforts we went live with our new cloudbased platform which we believe will improve our forecasting agility as part of our digital transformation further our hybrid work strategy has enabled us to accelerate our location strategy while providing a more flexible workspace going forward we are enabling hp’s hybrid work strategy by modernizing our sites to be critical hubs for collaboration and innovation this will also deliver savings in our real estate portfolio for more information on our fiscal 2020 plan see note 3 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which is incorporated herein by reference 

we typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by increasing supply constraints shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

our covid19 response 

we continue to closely monitor the covid19 pandemic including its resurgence in key markets we will continue promoting the health safety and wellbeing of workers and their loved ones in response to the covid19 pandemic we have established a crossfunctional covid19 program management office that reviews the latest data from our business and site leaders and identifies and addresses emerging risks and issues and we have put in place global policies and protocols based on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders which we continue to review and update we balance our companywide approach by assessing risk and adjusting our response at the site level taking into consideration each countrys or areas covid19 case trends and related measures we have commenced a phased approach to returning our employees onsite which included modifications to certain of our facilities as we adapt to a hybrid work environment 

the business impact of the covid19 pandemic has created new and different demand dynamics in the market our personal systems business benefited from the remote working and learning environment including growth in gaming we saw continued strong demand in consumer pcs and mix shifts from low end to premium products in commercial pcs in the second half of fiscal year 2021we had seen a strong chromebook demand in first half of the year in printing consumer print demand remained strong and commercial print is expected to continue its gradual improvement as more offices reopen also favorable pricing including historically low promotions and incentives have contributed positively towards average selling prices “asps” and gross margin in both personal systems and printing we estimate sales and marketing program incentives based on a number of factors like historical experience expected customer behavior and market conditions these estimates have been and may continue to be impacted by lowerthanexpected incentives due to increased supply constraints shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impact of the covid19 pandemic demand fulfillment has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by industry wide commodity and component constraints primarily integrated circuits and panels manufacturing disruptions in asia and logistics challenges globally at least in shortterm 

as the covid19 pandemic continues and new variants of the virus emerge we are seeing a resurgence of the pandemic in key markets we have and may experience future disruptions in supply manufacturing and logistics including in asia and with our suppliers and outsourcing partners the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations cash flows and financial position will depend on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to the severity duration and scope of the pandemic including the impact of coronavirus mutations and resurgences the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic and prevent or limit any reoccurrence the development availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides

critical accounting policies and estimates   

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states “us” generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of october 31 2021 the impact of covid19 on our business continued to unfold as a result many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available our estimates may change in future periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp’s board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 “overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we evaluate customers’ ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience financial metrics and customer credit scores 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions there are contracts which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of performance obligations that are distinct the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations 

we evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct good or services a performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract 

transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer if the transaction price includes a variable amount we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method we reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

distributor programs and incentive offerings rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns we use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on historical experience expected consumer behavior and market conditions 

when a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations such as hardware andor services we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price the selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price “ssp” we establish ssp using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold separately “observable price” and in some instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority when observable price is not available we establish ssp based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement in most arrangements with multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price 

revenue is recognized when or as a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer we generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms for fixedprice support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of standready obligations payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the duration of the contract in instances when revenue is derived from sales of thirdparty vendor products or services we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor we consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty obligation may be required 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit credit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount

rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit credit cost for fiscal year 2021 



taxes on earnings 

as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2029 

material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 60 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions pension and related interest we adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable we may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our provision for taxes net earnings and cash flows for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions along with the impact of covid19 factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent third parties to perform an appraisal when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment may include changes in business climate market conditions or other events impacting the reporting unit if we determine an impairment is more likely than not based on our qualitative assessment a quantitative assessment of impairment is performed 

performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include among others revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables if we determine the carrying amount exceeds fair value goodwill is impaired and the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property “ip” commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” are not a meaningful indicator of hp’s potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2021 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations   

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplement the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue with the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which excludes the effect of foreign currency 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly exchange rates from the comparative period and excluding any hedging impact recognized in the current period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results the constant currency measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



  

net revenue 

in fiscal year 2021 total net revenue increased 121 increased 102 on a constant currency basis as compared to the prioryear period net revenue from the united states increased 110 to 224 billion and outside of the united states increased 127 to 411 billion the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks supplies consumer and commercial printing and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by decline in desktops the increase in net revenue is due to strong demand and higher asps driven by work from home and remote learning 

a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under “segment information” below 

gross margin

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rate was 134 in fiscal year 2021 in fiscal year 2021 our effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to changes in valuation allowances and favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore and malaysia 

for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 in fiscal year 2021 and further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the components of net revenue and the weighted net revenue change by business unit were as follows 



1 weighted net revenue change percentage points measures contribution of each business unit towards overall segment revenue growth it is calculated by dividing the change in revenue of each business unit from the prioryear period by total segment revenue for the prioryear period 

fiscal year 2021 compared with fiscal year 2020 

personal systems net revenue increased 112 increased 88 on a constant currency basis in fiscal year 2021 as compared to the prioryear period the net revenue increase was primarily due to growth in notebooks and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by decline in desktops the net revenue increase was driven by 98 increase in unit volume and 13 increase in asps the increase in unit volume was primarily due to growth in notebooks resulting from strong demand driven by work from home remote learning and gaming partially offset by decline in desktops also industrywide supply chain constraints limited unit growth during the fiscal year 2021 the increase in asps was primarily due to favorable pricing including lower promotions and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by mix shifts 

consumer pcs revenue increased 199 driven by unit growth in notebooks and desktops and higher asps commercial revenue increased 64 primarily driven by unit growth in notebooks partially offset by lower asps driven by higher chromebook mix and unit declines in desktops 

consequently net revenue increased 185 in notebooks and decreased 43 in desktops and 81 in workstations 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 13 percentage points the increase was primarily due to an increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue the increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable pricing including lower promotions and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by higher commodity and logistics costs operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 07 percentage points primarily due to rd investments in innovation gotomarket initiatives and higher variable compensation

the components of the net revenue and weighted net revenue change by business unit were as follows 



  1 weighted net revenue change percentage points measures the contribution of each business unit towards overall segment revenue growth it is calculated by dividing the change in revenue of each business unit from the prior period by total segment revenue for the prioryear period 

fiscal year 2021 compared with fiscal year 2020 

printing net revenue increased 141 increased 132 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2021 as compared to the prioryear period the growth in net revenue was primarily driven by a growth in supplies consumer and commercial net revenue for supplies increased 90 as compared to the prioryear period primarily driven by favorable pricing including lower promotions and improvement in enterprise and smb demand printer asps increased 262 and printer unit volume increased 30 as compared to the prioryear period printer asps increased primarily due to favorable pricing including lower promotions the increase in printer unit volume was driven by both consumer and commercial while there has been unit growth compared to prioryear period we continue to experience supply chain constraints including component shortages which limited growth during fiscal year 2021 

net revenue for commercial increased 189 as compared to the prioryear period due to a 76 increase in printer unit volume and a 204 increase in asps the printer unit volume increased due to improved demand as compared to prioryear period which was impacted by covid19 the increase in asps was primarily driven by favorable pricing and mix shifts 

net revenue for consumer increased 306 as compared to the prioryear period due to a 274 increase in asps and a 24 increase in printer unit volume the increase in asps was primarily driven by favorable pricing the printer unit volume increased due to strong demand from remote working and learning 

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 40 percentage points for the fiscal year 2021 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to increase in gross margin driven by favorable pricing including lower promotions partially offset by mix shifts operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat 

corporate investments 

the loss from operations in corporate investments for the fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects and investments in digital enablement 

liquidity and capital resources   

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity while the impacts from the covid19 pandemic were originally expected to be temporary however with the emergence of new variants there remains uncertainty around the extent and duration of the pandemic and how our liquidity and working capital needs may be impacted in the future periods as a result we believe that current cash cash flow from operating activities new borrowings available commercial paper authorization and the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet hp’s operating cash requirements planned capital expenditures interest and principal payments on all borrowings pension and postretirement funding requirements authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments for the foreseeable future additionally if suitable acquisition opportunities arise the company may obtain all or a portion of the required financing through additional borrowings while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a which are incorporated herein by reference 

during the fiscal year 2021 hp completed four acquisitions with a combined purchase price of 854 million net of cash acquired of which 400 million was recorded as goodwill and 385 million as intangible assets related to these acquisitions for more information see note 18 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which is incorporated herein by reference

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

our cash and cash equivalents balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the united states the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” made significant changes to the us tax law including a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings the payments associated with this onetime transition tax will be paid over eight years and began in fiscal year 2019 we expect a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to us income tax upon a subsequent repatriation to the united states as a result of the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax upon repatriation as we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds including reducing our gross debt level or other uses 

liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents marketable debt securities and total debt were as follows 



1 includes highly liquid us treasury notes us agency securities nonus government bonds corporate debt securities money market and other funds we classify these investments within other current assets in consolidated balance sheets including those with maturity dates beyond one year based on their highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations 

our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



operating activities   

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 21 billion for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to higher earnings from operation including net gain from the onetime oracle litigation proceeds of 18 billion partially offset by higher cash utilized in working capital activities as a result of changes in demand dynamics and supply chain constraints due to covid19 

key working capital metrics 

management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level the table below presents the cash conversion cycle 



the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring macroeconomic factors seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for credit losses by a 90day average of net revenue the decrease in dso as compared to prioryear period was due to strong collections and favorable revenue linearity 

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold the increase in dos as compared to prioryear period was primarily due to higher strategic buys to better assure supply of commodities in personal systems and recovering printing inventory from the impacts of covid19 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold the decrease in dpo compared to prioryear period was primarily due to higher commodity costs partially offset by working capital management activities 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities remained flat for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to decrease in investments of 06 billion and collateral related to derivative instruments of 03 billion partially offset by higher net payments for acquisitions of 09 billion 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 30 billion in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to higher share repurchases of 31 billion and lower proceeds from debt issuance of 10 billion partially offset by lower payment of debt of 06 billion and higher proceeds from commercial paper of 04 billion 

share repurchases and dividends 

in fiscal year 2021 hp returned 72 billion to the shareholders in the form of share repurchases of 63 billion and cash dividends of 09 billion as of october 31 2021 hp had approximately 64 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations approved by hp’s board of directors hp intends to continue to repurchase shares at an elevated level of at least 40 billion in fiscal year 2022 

for more information on our share repurchases see note 12 “stockholders’ deficit” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

capital resources 

debt levels   



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted leverage ratio 

shortterm debt increased by 04 billion and longterm debt increased by 08 billion for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 the net increase in total debt was primarily due to issuance of unsecured senior debt in june 2021 amounting to 20 billion and commercial paper of 04 billion issued in september 2021 which was partially offset by payment of 10 billion in july 2021 towards redemption of existing notes maturing in september and december 2021 

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 10 “financial instruments” in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” which is incorporated herein by reference 

on may 26 2021 we entered into a new 50 billion 5year sustainabilitylinked senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility the ‘new revolving facility” which will be available until may 26 2026 commitment fees interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the new revolving facility vary based on hp’s external credit ratings and certain sustainability metrics 

as of october 31 2021 we continue to maintain the new revolving facility funds borrowed under the new revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

on june 16 2021 we issued 20 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes across various maturities we used approximately 10 billion of the proceeds from such issuance to fund the redemption of existing notes maturing in september and december 2021 for more information on the new notes and the redemption of existing notes see note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which is incorporated herein by reference 

available borrowing resources 

as of october 31 2021 we had available borrowing resources of 579 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to the new revolving facility 

the amendment to our 2019 shelf registration statement to convert to a nonautomatic shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february 25 2021 and enables us to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings 50 billion in the aggregate of debt securities common stock preferred stock depository shares and warrants 

for more information on our borrowings see note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information they obtain during our ongoing discussions while we currently do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt a downgrade from our current credit rating may increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facility reduce market capacity for our commercial paper require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts and may have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position depending on the extent of such downgrade we can access alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facility if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

contractual and other obligations 

our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2021 were as follows 



1 amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our shortterm and longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments discounts or premiums 

2 amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our shortterm and longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our us dollar global notes to variable interest rates the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31 2021 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt 

3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

4 retirement and postretirement benefit plan contributions in fiscal year 2022 we expect to contribute approximately 44 million to nonus pension plans 36 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants and 4 million to cover benefit claims for our postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution required by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions and payments to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

5 cost savings plans as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect to make future cash payments of approximately 03 billion we expect to make future cash payments of 02 billion in fiscal year 2022 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2023 these payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments for more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements see note 3 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

6 uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2021 we had approximately 584 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities for more information on our uncertain tax positions see note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in over 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2021 were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the japanese yen and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent in cost of sales in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2021 and 2020 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchang e l oss of 168 million and 77 million at october 31 2021 and october 31 2020 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we may use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve a floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability in interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2021 and 2020 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 73 million at october 31 2021 and 36 million at october 31 2020

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

introduction 

this compensation discussion and analysis describes our executive compensation philosophy and program the compensation decisions the hr and compensation “hrc” committee has made under the program and the considerations in making those decisions in fiscal 2019 

named executive officers our neos for fiscal 2019 are 

 following the end of fiscal 2019 mr weisler stepped down as our president and ceo on november 1 2019 and mr lores was appointed to the role upon stepping down from such positions mr weisler continues to be employed by the company as senior executive advisor a nonexecutive officer role through our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders mr weisler will also continue to serve as a member of the board of directors until the company’s 2020 annual meeting of stockholders 

executive summary 

the hrc committee continues to review and refine our compensation programs to support our evolving business strategy and attract high caliber executive talent the hrc committee’s assessment includes regular stockholder engagement and consideration of stockholder feedback hp’s fiscal 2019 executive compensation structure remained the same as its fiscal 2018 program 

below are brief highlights of key compensation decisions with respect to neos 

we provided competitive target pay opportunities where amounts and mix were consistent with peers and stable year over year 

target total direct compensation “tdc” consists of base salary percentofsalary target annual incentives that would be earned for achieving 100 of goals and longterm incentive grantdate value neo base salaries were unchanged for fiscal 2019 except a 74 promotional increase for ms rivera upon being appointed president strategy and business management in addition to her ongoing role as chief legal officer and secretary plus a 36 market adjustment for mr weisler hp’s president and ceo target annual incentives were unchanged at 200 of salary for mr weisler and 125 of salary for each of the other neos regular longterm incentive grant values increased moderately consistent with the market 

we aligned real pay delivery with performance through rigorous goal setting and performance measurement 

while our target tdc opportunities reflect market practice our real pay delivery reflects performance annual incentives reward shortterm performance measured against applicable enterprisewide business unit and individual goals goals were set for the overall company and businesses against internal budgets for revenues net earningsprofit and free cash flow as a percent of revenue nonfinancial individual performance goals under the management by objectives “mbo” program were set for each neo meanwhile regular annual longterm incentive grants were approximately 60 in parsus that reward strategic performance measured by relative tsr compared to the sp 500 and eps measured in two and three year overlapping segments as explained on pages 1618 the remaining 40 is in rsus that are primarily for ownership and retention with the delivered value tied to stock price and reinvested dividend equivalents 

neos earned annual incentives averaging 1172 of target for fiscal 2019 individual bonuses varied from 932 to 1507 of target and hp’s president  ceo was at 1115 the company achieved abovetarget results with respect to hp net earningsprofit and free cash flow margin revenue results were below target further neos successfully delivered against their mbos as detailed on pages 1516 

 

neos received payout for segment 1 fy18 and segment 2 fy17 parsus measurement periods ending in fiscal 2019 eps fy18 and eps fy19 were above target fiscal 20172019 relative tsr approximated the 35 th percentile of the sp 500 fiscal 20182019 relative tsr approximated the 15 th percentile of the sp 500 

we regularly engaged with and listened to stockholders practiced strong governance and mitigated potential compensationrelated risks 

our executive compensation program is continuously reviewed for peer group alignment and strategic relevance as part of a process that includes ongoing stockholder engagement at the annual meeting in 2019 our sayonpay proposal was approved by over 93 of the voted shares indicating strong stockholder support consequently changes have not been extensive to ensure alignment with our threeyear financial plan we have moved our longterm performancebased incentives parsus to a single threeyear performance period with full vesting only after three years of service and achievement of financial goals for that timeframe we are also changing relative tsr from a standalone measure to a “modifier” on earnouts determined based on the threeyear performance period we feel that this will increase focus on lineofsight strategic performance while continuing close alignment between stockholder value creation and real pay delivery 

we transitioned to a new hp president  ceo at the start of fiscal 2020 successfully executing the board’s successionplanning process 

after a robust indepth succession planning assessment mr lores was appointed as president and ceo effective november 1 2019 mr lores’s initial target tdc was set moderately below the peer group median and the hrc committee’s intent is to move him to the median or above median over the period of the next twoorthree years based on company and individual performance mr lores did not receive a promotion grant or any special rewards in connection to his appointment as president and ceo 

executive compensation program oversight and authority 

role of the hrc committee and its advisor the hrc committee continued to retain fw cook as its independent consultant during fiscal 2019 and to work with them and management on all aspects of our pay program for senior executives the hrc committee makes recommendations regarding the ceo’s compensation to the independent members of the board for approval and reviews and approves the compensation of the remaining section 16 officers including our neos each hrc committee member is an independent nonemployee director with significant experience in executive compensation matters 

the hrc committee continually considers feedback from stockholders and the potential executive compensation implications of evolving business and strategic objectives based on these considerations the hrc determined that it would be appropriate to make some finetuning changes in the program structure for 2020 described further on page 19 that we believe are in our stockholders’ interests we believe that our current compensation structure and proposed changes incent and reward achievement of specific goals reinforce yearoveryear results and provide an attractive payforperformance opportunity that encourages retention and leadership engagement 

fw cook provides analyses and recommendations that inform the hrc committee’s decisions identifies peer group companies for competitive market comparisons evaluates market pay data and competitiveposition benchmarking provides analyses and inputs on program structure performance measures and goals provides updates on market trends and the regulatory environment as it relates to executive compensation reviews various management proposals presented to the hrc committee related to executive and director compensation and works with the hrc committee to validate and strengthen the payforperformance relationship and alignment with stockholder interests fw cook does not perform other services for hp and will not do so without the prior consent of the hrc committee chair fw cook meets with the hrc committee chair and the hrc committee outside the presence of management while in executive session 

the hrc committee met six times in fiscal 2019 and all six of these meetings included an executive session fw cook participated in five of the meetings and when requested by the hrc committee chair in the preparatory meetings and the executive sessions 

role of management and the ceo in setting executive compensation the ceo recommends compensation for section 16 officers including neos other than himself for approval by the hrc committee the board considered market competitiveness business results experience and individual performance when evaluating fiscal 2019 neo compensation and the overall compensation structure the chief human resources officer and other members of our executive compensation team together with members of our finance and legal organizations work with the ceo to design and develop the compensation program to recommend changes to existing program provisions applicable to neos and other senior executives as well as financial and other targets to be achieved under those programs prepare analyses of financial data peer comparisons and other briefing materials to assist the hrc committee in making its decisions and implement the decisions of the hrc committee 

during fiscal 2019 management continued to engage meridian compensation partners llc “meridian” as its compensation consultant the hrc committee took into consideration that meridian provided executive compensationrelated services to management when it evaluated any information and analyses provided by meridian all of which were also independently reviewed by fw cook as applicable on the hrc committee’s behalf 

 

during fiscal 2019 mr weisler provided input to the hrc committee regarding performance metrics and the setting of appropriate performance targets for his direct reports mr weisler also recommended mbos for the neos other than himself and the other senior executives who report directly to him mr weisler is subject to the same financial performance goals as the executives who lead global functions and mr weisler’s mbos and compensation are established by the hrc committee and recommended to the independent members of the board for approval 

use of comparative compensation data and compensation philosophy 

the hrc committee reviews the compensation of our section 16 officers in comparison to that of executives in similar positions at our peer group companies our peer group includes companies we compete with for executive talent due to our geographical proximity and technology industry overlap the hrc committee takes size differentiations into consideration when reviewing the results of market data analysis the hrc committee uses this information to evaluate how our pay levels and practices compare to market practices 

when determining the peer group the following characteristics were considered 

 we believe the resulting peer group provides hp and the hrc committee with a valid comparison and benchmark for the company’s executive compensation program and governance practices for fiscal 2019 the hrc committee added apple direct peer and micron technology sizeappropriate technology company the hrc committee also removed amazon procter  gamble and verizon as all exceeded size range and were not direct peers the hp peer group for fiscal 2019 as approved by hrc committee consisted of the following companies 

fiscal 2019 peer group 

  

process for setting and awarding executive compensation 

a broad range of facts and circumstances are considered in setting our overall executive compensation levels in fiscal 2019 the hrc committee continued to set target compensation levels within a competitive range of the market median although in some cases lower or higher based on each executive’s situation eg attraction and retention of critical talent the board maintains a total ceo target compensation package that approximates the median of our competitive market and is consistent with our pay positioning strategy and payforperformance philosophy 

the primary factors considered when determining pay opportunities for our neos are market competitiveness internal equity and individual performance the weight given to each factor is not formulaic and may differ from year to year or by individual neo for example when we recruit externally market competitiveness experience and the candidatespecific circumstances may weigh more heavily in the compensation decision process in contrast when determining yearoveryear compensation changes for current neos internal equity and individual performance may factor more heavily in the decision 

the hrc committee spends significant time determining the appropriate goals for our annual and longterm incentive plans which make up the majority of neo compensation management makes an initial recommendation of the goals which is then assessed by the hrc committee’s independent compensation consultant and discussed and approved by the hrc committee major factors considered in setting financial goals for each fiscal year are business results from the most recently completed fiscal year budgets and strategic plans macroeconomic factors guidance and analyst expectations industry performance conditions or goals specific to a particular business segment and strategic initiatives mbos are set based on major shared and individual strategic operating and tactical initiatives 

following the close of the fiscal year the hrc committee reviews actual financial results and mbo performance against the goals that it had set for the applicable plans for that year with payouts under the plans determined based on performance against the established goals the hrc committee meets in executive session to review the mbo performance of the ceo and to determine a recommendation for his annual pfr incentive award to be approved by the independent members of the board see “2019 annual incentives” below for a further description of our results and corresponding incentive payouts 

listening to our stockholders on compensation 

we regularly engage with our stockholders on a variety of issues including their views on best practices in executive compensation the following changes to our executive compensation program shown here reflect those conversations with stockholders 

  at the 2019 annual meeting our annual sayonpay proposal received the support of over 93 of the votes cast as part of its 2019 executive compensation discussions the hrc committee reviewed the advisory vote result and considered it to be supportive of the company’s compensation practices 

determination of fiscal 2019 executive compensation 

under our total rewards program executive compensation consists of base salary annual incentives longterm incentives benefits and perquisites 

the hrc committee regularly explores ways to improve our executive compensation program by considering stockholder feedback our current business needs and strategy and peer group practices for 2019 the committee decided to maintain a consistent compensation structure for executives since it supports our business strategy and aligns pay with stockholder interests 

2019 base salary our executives receive a small percentage of their overall compensation in the form of base salary which is consistent with our philosophy of tying the majority of pay to performance the neos are paid an amount in the form of base salary sufficient to attract qualified executive talent and maintain a stable management team 

 

the hrc committee aims to set executive base salaries at or near the market median for comparable positions in fiscal 2019 salaries comprise on average 11 of our neos’ overall compensation consistent with our peers to decide the ceo’s salary the hrc committee reviews analyses and recommendations provided by fw cook 

for fiscal 2019 mr weisler’s salary was increased from 14 million to  145 million to recognize his contributions and better align with the market median for fiscal 2019 the hrc committee did not change the base salary for mr fieler mr lores or mr cho during fiscal 2018 mr fieler’s base salary had been increased to 690000 during july 2018 and mr cho’s base salary had been increased to 675000 during june 2018 in conjunction with their promotions to cfo and president personal systems respectively ms rivera’s base salary was increased from 675000 to 725000 due to her new responsibilities as president strategy and business management while retaining her role as chief legal officer and secretary 

 2019 annual incentives the fiscal 2019 annual pfr incentive plan consisted of the following three core financial metrics revenue net earningsprofit and corporate free cash flow as a percentage of revenue a fourth metric mbos was used to further drive individual performance and achievement of key strategic goals each metric was weighted at 25 of the target award value each individual metric may fund up to 250 of target however the maximum annual pfr incentive for each executive is capped at 200 of target 

the target annual pfr incentive awards for fiscal 2019 were set at 200 of salary for the ceo and 125 of salary for the other neos 

for fiscal 2019 the hrc committee again established an “umbrella” formula governing the maximum bonus and then exercised negative discretion in setting actual bonuses under the umbrella formula each section 16 officer including each neo was allocated a pro rata share of 075 of net earnings based on his or her target annual pfr incentive award subject to a maximum bonus of 200 of the neo’s target bonus and the maximum 15 million individual cap under the stock incentive plan below this umbrella funding structure actual payouts were determined based upon financial metrics and mbos established and evaluated by the hrc committee for section 16 officers including each neo and by the independent members of the board for the ceo 

   

 the specific metrics their linkage to corporate results and the weighting that was placed on each were chosen because the hrc committee believed that 

 the following chart sets forth the definition of and rationale for each of the financial performance metrics that was used for the fiscal 2019 annual incentive plan 

   

following fiscal 2019 the hrc committee reviewed performance against the financial metrics and certified the results as follows 

  mr weisler  at the end of the fiscal year the independent members of the board evaluated mr weisler’s performance against all of his mbos which included but were not limited to setting strategic direction for the company based on optimizing stockholder value maintaining supplies stabilization growing profitable share in personal systems engaging with all major constituents including financial analysts media key governmental figures partners and customers to execute the hp strategy and ensuring hp has a robust evaluation and talent program after conducting a thorough review of mr weisler’s performance the independent members of the board determined that his mbo performance reflected a number of accomplishments but overall had been achieved below target due to print supplies performance mr weisler had strong accomplishments including the following 

 as ceo mr weisler evaluated the performance of each of the other section 16 officers including each of the other neos and presented the results of those evaluations to the hrc committee at its november 2019 meeting the evaluations included an analysis of the officers’ performance against all of their mbos the hrc committee reviewed the ceo’s assessment of the degree of attainment of the mbos of the other section 16 officers and set their mbo scores the results of these evaluations for the other neos are summarized below 

mr fieler  the hrc committee determined that mr fieler’s mbos performance had been achieved below target due to print supplies performance overall mr fieler demonstrated strategic thoughtful and engaged leadership in running the finance function his strong operational perspective supported the company through business changes mr fieler has strong relationships with the investor relations community and is critical to ensuring our results deliver against financial expectations 

 

mr lores  the hrc committee determined that mr lores’s mbos performance had been achieved below target due to print supplies performance mr lores did continue reinventing the print business with a focus on differentiated innovation business model transformation and strategic ma over the past year mr lores did a remarkable job working with the hp board on a comprehensive global review of the company strategy and business operations with a focus on simplifying its operating model evolving its business models and driving significant improvement in its cost structure while making the company more digitally enabled and customer centric 

ms rivera  the hrc committee determined that ms rivera’s mbo performance had been achieved above target ms rivera worked closely with the businesses on critical matters such as supplies infringements counterfeit seizures and ip protection she did an excellent job on corporate governance tariffs investigations launching the “transformation management office” and customer service transformation initiatives ms rivera is a wellrespected leader with a strong understanding of commercial decisions and is a strong partner in business technology and governance matters 

mr cho  the hrc committee determined that mr cho’s mbo performance had been achieved above target despite the various challenges in the marketplace mr cho did an excellent job in delivering profits and steady revenue progress he did a remarkable job in the introduction and roll out of new products such as dragonfly in asia mr cho is a thoughtful and well respected leader in the organization with a strong team to drive the business appropriately 

based on the findings of these performance evaluations the hrc committee and in the case of the ceo the independent members of the board evaluated performance against the nonfinancial metrics for the neos as follows 

 based on the level of performance described above on both the financial and nonfinancial metrics for fiscal 2019 the payouts to the neos under the annual pfr incentive were as follows 

 longterm incentive compensation the hrc committee established a total longterm incentive target value for each neo in early fiscal 2019 that was 60 weighted in the form of parsus and 40 weighted in the form of timebased rsus the high proportion of performancebased awards reflects our payforperformance philosophy the timebased awards support retention and are linked to stockholder value and ownership which are important goals of our executive compensation program 

 

2019 parsus the fiscal 2019 parsus have the same structure as used in the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 parsus fiscal 2019 parsus have a twoand threeyear vesting period subject to one two and threeyear performance periods that began at the start of fiscal 2019 and continue through the end of fiscal 2019 2020 and 2021 under this program 50 of the parsus including dividend equivalent units are eligible for vesting based on eps and 50 are eligible for vesting based on relative tsr performance these parsus vest as follows 166 of the units are eligible for vesting based on eps performance of year one with continued service over two years 166 of the units are eligible for vesting based on eps performance of year two with continued service over three years 166 of the units are eligible for vesting based on eps performance of year three with continued service over three years 25 of the units are eligible for vesting based on relative tsr performance over two years with continued service over two years and 25 of the units are eligible for vesting based on relative tsr performance over three years with continued service over three years this structure is depicted in the chart below 

  eps was chosen because it is a critical driver of longterm stockholder value and because of our focus on bottomline profitability in the business transformation strategy year 1 fiscal 2019 eps goals were set after consideration of historical performance internal budgets external expectations and peer group performance 

relative tsr was chosen as a performance measure because it is a direct measure of stockholder value and rewards for outperformance relative to the broader market 

eps and relative tsr are weighted equally in determining earned parsus the first segment 42 of total target units will vest after the end of fiscal 2020 subject to year 1 eps performance and relative tsr performance for the first two years the second segment 58 of total target units will vest after the end of fiscal 2021 subject to year 2 eps performance year 3 eps performance and relative tsr performance for the three years 

for more information on grants of parsus to the neos during fiscal 2019 see “compensation tables—grants of planbased awards in fiscal 2019” 

2019 rsus 2019 rsus and related dividend equivalent units vest ratably on an annual basis over three years from the grant date threeyear vesting is common in our industry and supports executive retention and alignment with stockholder value 

 

fiscal 2019 longterm incentive compensation at target the following table shows combined total grant values for grants attributable to fiscal 2019 it is important to note that these values are target opportunities to earn future valuebased compensation and are not actual earned amounts which will be determined after three years based on continued employment and performance against the eps and relative tsr goals 

 values in the summary compensation table are different than the target values described in the table above in the summary compensation table consistent with accounting standards amounts reflect the grant date fair value for the full tsr component two and threeyear performance period and the eps component for year 1 2019 for which goals were approved in january 2019 grant date fair values for the eps component for year 2 2020 and year 3 2021 are not included in the grant date fair value reported in the summary compensation table since eps goals for those years are approved in their respective fiscal year 

the summary compensation table for fiscal 2019 also includes a portion of the fiscal 2018 parsus year 2 eps 2019 and 2017 parsus year 3 eps 2019 for which the goal was approved in fiscal 2019

ceo transition 

dion weisler stepped down from his positions as president and chief executive officer of the company effective november 1 2019 upon stepping down from such positions mr weisler continued to be employed by the company in a nonexecutive role as a senior executive advisor during the period between november 1 2019 through january 31 2020 mr weisler’s compensation arrangements remained unchanged from those in place while he served as president and chief executive officer of the company the board approved continuing to employ mr weisler as a senior executive advisor beyond january 31 2020 through the date of the company’s 2020 annual meeting of stockholders with his compensation consisting solely of his base salary at the monthly rate of 120833 which was mr weisler’s base salary rate for fiscal year 2019 mr weisler also continued to serve as a member of the board and will continue to do so until the company’s 2020 annual meeting of stockholders he has not received and will not receive any compensation in connection with his services as a member of the board 

fiscal 2020 compensation program 

the hrc committee regularly identifies and evaluates ways to improve our executive compensation program we believe that our current compensation structure effectively aligns real pay delivery with critical financial and strategic nonfinancial goals reinforces yearoveryear improvement and growth offers a stable and consistent message to both stockholders and participants and provides an attractive payforperformance opportunity to encourage retention and leadership engagement 

however as we plan to discuss in further detail in the fiscal 2020 proxy statement we made the following changes that we believe are in our stockholders’ interests and are appropriate to the characteristics and business strategy of the company and to ensure our compensation is tied to our threeyear strategic and financial plan 

 fiscal 2021 compensation program 

as the hrc committee embarks upon our compensation plan design for 2021 and beyond we will be looking at the most appropriate measures to continue reinforcing the commitments articulated in our longterm financial plans while eps and tsr are important measures that tie management and stockholder interest key metrics like operating profit and cash flow could be impactful as threeyear measures tied to our longterm incentives operating profit and cash flow are critical value drivers to deliver on the longterm commitments we have made to stockholders the final compensation structure will be discussed in more detail in our 2021 proxy 

benefits 

we do not provide our executives including the neos with special or supplemental us defined benefit pension or health benefits our neos receive health and welfare benefits including retiree medical benefits if eligibility conditions are met under the same programs and subject to the same eligibility requirements that apply to our employees generally 

benefits under all us pension plans were frozen effective december 31 2007 benefits under the electronic data systems “eds” pension plan ceased upon hp’s acquisition of eds in 2008 as a result no neo or any other hp employee accrued a benefit under any hp us defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2019 the amounts reported as an increase in pension benefits in the summary compensation table are for those neos who previously accrued a benefit in a defined benefit pension plan prior to the cessation of accruals and reflect changes in actuarial values only not additional benefit accruals 

the neos along with other executives who earn base pay or an annual incentive in excess of certain limits of the code or greater than 150000 are eligible to participate in the 2005 executive deferred compensation plan the “edcp” this plan is maintained to permit executives to defer some of their compensation in order to also defer taxation on such amounts this is a standard benefit plan also offered by most of our peer group companies the edcp permits deferral of base pay in excess of the amount allowed under the qualified hp 401k plan the 401kdeferral limit for calendar 2019 was 19000 and up to 95 of the annual incentive payable under the stock incentive plan the pfr plan and other eligible plans in addition we make a 4 matching contribution to the edcp on base pay contributions in excess of irs limits up to a maximum of two times that limit maximum of 11200 in calendar 2019 

 

this is the same percentage of matching contributions those executives are eligible to receive under the 401k plan in effect the edcp permits these executives and all eligible employees to receive a 401ktype matching contribution on a portion of basepay deferrals in excess of irs limits amounts deferred or matched under the edcp are credited with hypothetical investment earnings based on investment options selected by the participant from among nearly all the proprietary funds available to employees under the 401k plan no amounts earn abovemarket returns benefits payable under the edcp are unfunded and unsecured 

executives are also eligible to have a yearly hppaid medical exam as part of the hp us executive physical program this includes a comprehensive exam thorough health assessment and personalized health advice this benefit is also offered by our peer group companies 

consistent with its practice of not providing any special or supplemental executive defined benefit programs including arrangements that would otherwise provide special benefits to the family of a deceased executive in 2011 the hrc committee adopted a policy that unless approved by our stockholders pursuant to an advisory vote we will not enter into a new plan program or agreement or modify an existing plan program or agreement with a section 16 officer including the neos that provides for payments grants or awards following the death of the officer in the form of unearned salary or unearned annual incentives accelerated vesting or the continuation in force of unvested equity grants perquisites and other payments or awards made in lieu of compensation except to the extent that such payments grants or awards are provided or made available to our employees generally 

we provide our executives with financial counseling services to assist them in obtaining professional financial advice a common benefit among our peer group companies for convenience and to increase the understanding and effectiveness of our executive compensation program 

limited perquisites 

we provide a small number of perquisites to our senior executives including the neos for a list of all perquisites provided to our neos for fiscal 2019 please refer to the all other compensation table on page 25 

due to our global presence we maintain one corporate aircraft in the event a neo is accompanied by a guest or family member on the aircraft for personal reasons as approved by the ceo the neo is taxed on the value of this usage according to the relevant code rules there is no tax grossup paid on the income attributable to this value among our neos mr weisler is the only executive that used the corporate aircraft for personal use during fiscal 2019 which was for convenience and security 

our audit committee periodically conducts global risk management reviews which include reviewing home security services of neos services considered necessary by the audit committee may be paid for by hp due to the range of security issues that may be encountered by key executives of any large multinational corporation 

termination and change in control protections 

severance and longterm incentive change in control plan for executive officers our section 16 officers including all of the neos are covered by the severance and longterm incentive change in control plan for executive officers “speo” which is intended to protect us and our stockholders and provide a level of transition assistance in the event of an involuntary termination of employment under the speo participants who incur an involuntary termination ie a termination not for cause and who execute a full and effective release of claims following such termination are eligible to receive severance benefits in an amount determined as a multiple of base pay plus the average of the actual annual incentives paid for the preceding three years in the case of the neos other than the ceo the multiplier is 15 in the case of the ceo the multiplier is 20 in all cases this benefit will not exceed 299 times the sum of the executive’s base pay plus target annual incentive as in effect immediately prior to the termination of employment 

although most of the compensation for our executives is performancebased and largely contingent upon the achievement of financial goals the hrc committee continues to believe that the speo is appropriate for the attraction and retention of executive talent in addition we find it more equitable to offer severance benefits based on a standard formula for the section 16 officers including all of the neos because severance often serves as a bridge when employment is involuntarily terminated and should therefore not be affected by other longerterm accumulations as a result and consistent with the practice of our peer group companies other compensation decisions are not generally based on the existence of this severance protection 

in addition to the cash benefit speo participants are eligible to receive 1 a prorata annual incentive for the year of termination based on actual performance results at the discretion of the hrc committee 2 prorata vesting of unvested equity awards and for performancebased equity awards only if any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and 3 payment of a lumpsum healthbenefit stipend of an amount equal to 18 months’ cobra premiums for continued group medical coverage for the executive and his or her eligible dependents 

severance benefits in the event of a change in control in order to better ensure the retention of our executive leadership team in the event of a potentially disruptive corporate transaction the speo also includes change in control terms for our neos in 

 

addition to the benefits provided for involuntary terminations the speo provides for full vesting of outstanding stock options rsus and parsus upon involuntary termination not for cause or voluntary termination for good reason as defined in the plan within 24 months after a change in control “double trigger” and in situations where equity awards are not assumed by the surviving corporation a “modified double trigger” the speo further provides that under a double trigger parsus will vest based on target performance whereas under a modified double trigger parsus will vest based upon the greater of the number of parsus that would vest based on actual performance and the number of parsus that would vest prorata based upon target performance we do not provide tax gross ups in connection with terminations including terminations in the event of a change in control 

the hrc committee is focused on ensuring that the change of control provisions in the speo are consistent with market practice provide clarity to prospective and current executives and will help attract and retain talent 

other compensationrelated matters 

succession planning among the hrc committee’s responsibilities described in its charter is to oversee succession planning and leadership development the board plans for succession of the ceo and annually reviews senior management selection and succession planning that is undertaken by the hrc committee as part of this process the independent directors annually review the hrc committee’s recommended candidates for senior management positions to see that qualified candidates are available for all positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of the candidates the criteria used when assessing the qualifications of potential ceo successors include among others strategic vision and leadership operational excellence financial management executive officer leadership development ability to motivate employees and an ability to develop an effective working relationship with the board we also host a board buddy program through which each executive officer is aligned to a board member as a mentor to aid the executive’s development while giving board members a deeper understanding of the daytoday operations of the company 

in fiscal 2019 an executive talent review was conducted along with succession plans for each of the executive leaders successors were identified to reflect necessary skill sets performance potential and diversity development plans for successors were also established to ensure readiness and will be managed throughout the year in addition to the annual succession planning process the hrc committee participates in an indepth performance discussion of each executive officer at the time of the annual compensation review during fiscal 2019 we leveraged our robust indepth succession planning to successfully maneuver through various leadership changes on the executive team we executed a ceo assessment process in partnership with the board to identify internal and external candidates for mr weisler’s replacement which led to unanimous board support for mr lores we also shifted other executives into new or expanded roles based on business needs and tied to succession and development plans further there is a people update at each hrc committee meeting which includes a review of key people processes and developments for that quarter 

in addition the executive team participated in a robust development process that included individual assessments interviews with executive coaches and an individualized development plan that can be leveraged throughout the year development themes for the entire executive team will be addressed during quarterly facetoface meetings for full team development 

stock ownership guidelines and prohibition on hedging our stock ownership guidelines are designed to align executives’ interests with those of our stockholders and mitigate compensationrelated risk the current guidelines provide that within five years of assuming a designated position the ceo should attain an investment position in our stock equal to seven times his base salary and all other section 16 officers reporting directly to the ceo should attain an investment position equal to five times their base salaries shares counted toward these guidelines include any shares held by the executive directly or through a broker shares held through the 401k plan shares held as restricted stock shares underlying timevested rsus and shares underlying vested but unexercised stock options 50 of the inthemoney value of such options is used for this calculation mr weisler is the only neo who has served in a role covered by our stock ownership guidelines for over five years and his ownership exceeds the current guidelines our other neos are on pace to meet the stock ownership guidelines within the allotted time frame 

the hrc committee has adopted a policy prohibiting all employees including executive officers and directors from engaging in any form of hedging transaction derivatives equity swaps forwards etc involving company securities including among other things short sales and transactions involving publicly traded options in addition with limited exceptions our executive officers are prohibited from holding our securities in margin accounts and from pledging our securities as collateral for loans we believe that these policies further align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders 

 

accounting and tax effects the impact of accounting treatment is considered in developing and implementing our compensation programs including the accounting treatment as it applies to amounts awarded or paid to our executives 

the impact of federal tax laws on our compensation programs is also considered including the deductibility of compensation paid to the neos as limited by section 162m of the code for prior fiscal years section 162m included an exception from the deductibility limitation for qualified “performancebased compensation” this exception however has been repealed for tax years beginning in fiscal 2019 under the tax cuts and jobs act as such compensation paid to certain of our executive officers in excess of 10 million is not deductible unless it qualifies for certain transition relief applicable for compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect as of november 2 2017 in addition the tax cuts and jobs act increased the scope of individuals subject to the deduction limitation thus compensation originally intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from section 162m may not be fully deductible although our compensation program may take into consideration the section 162m rules as a factor these considerations will not necessarily limit compensation to amounts deductible under section 162m despite the modifications to section 162m the hrc committee intends to continue to implement compensation programs that it believes are competitive and in the best interests of hp and its stockholders 

policy for recoupment of performancebased incentives in fiscal 2006 the board adopted a “clawback” policy that provides board discretion to recover certain annual incentives from senior executives including the neos whose fraud or misconduct resulted in a significant restatement of financial results the policy specifically allows for the recovery of annual incentives paid at or above target from those senior executives whose fraud or misconduct resulted in the restatement where the annual incentives would have been lower absent the fraud or misconduct to the extent permitted by applicable law additionally our incentive plan document and award agreements allow for the recoupment of performancebased annual incentives and longterm incentives consistent with applicable law and the clawback policy 

also in fiscal 2014 we added a provision to our grant agreements to clarify that equity awards are subject to the clawback policy award agreements also provide board discretion to cause forfeiture of certain outstanding cash and equity awards for fraud or misconduct that results in reputational harm to hp even when such fraud or misconduct does not result in a significant restatement of financial results 

hr and compensation committee report on executive compensation

ceo pay ratio disclosure 

in accordance with sec rules we are reporting our ceo pay ratio as set forth in the summary compensation table our ceo’s annual total compensation for fiscal 2019 was 19317972 our median employee’s annual total compensation was 75013 resulting in a ceo pay ratio of 2581 

in calculating the ceo pay ratio the sec rules allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies apply certain exclusions and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations therefore our reported ceo pay ratio may not be comparable to ceo pay ratios reported by other companies due to differences in industries and geographical dispersion as well as the different estimates assumptions and methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their ceo pay ratios 

our ceo pay ratio is based on the following methodology 

 director compensation and stock ownership guidelines 

nonemployee director compensation is determined annually by the independent members of the board acting on the recommendation of the hrc committee in formulating its recommendation the hrc committee considers market data for our peer group and input from the independent compensation consultant retained by the hrc committee mr weisler and mr lores as employees of the company do not receive any separate compensation for their hp board service 

for the 2019 board year which began march 1 2019 and therefore approximates the period between annual stockholder meetings when nonemployee directors are regularly elected each nonemployee director was entitled to receive an annual cash board retainer of 105000 nonemployee directors may elect to defer up to 50 of their annual cash retainer additionally in lieu of the annual cash retainer nonemployee directors may elect to receive an equivalent value of equity either entirely in fully vested shares or in equal values of shares and stock options for fiscal 2019 two nonemployee directors elected to receive an equivalent value of equity in shares and stock options and two nonemployee directors elected to defer their annual cash retainer 

each nonemployee director also received an annual equity board retainer of 215000 for service during the 2019 board year with regular grants on the date of the annual stockholder 

 

meeting under special circumstances the annual equity retainer may be paid in cash no annual equity retainer was paid in cash during fiscal 2019 typically the annual equity retainer is paid at the election of the director either entirely in fully vested shares or in equal values of shares and stock options the number of shares subject to the equity awards is determined based on the fair market value of our stock on the grant date and the number of shares subject to stock option awards is determined as of the grant date based on a blackscholesmerton option pricing formula equity grants to nonemployee directors are primarily intended to strengthen alignment with stockholder interests and to reinforce a longterm ownership view of the company and its value retention is not the focus of equity grants for nonemployee directors and could cause entrenchment which is why servicerelated vesting on equity awards was eliminated in july 2017 nonemployee directors may elect to defer the settlement of shares received as part of the program until either a the first to occur of the director’s death disability as defined in section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or when the nonemployee director no longer serves as a member of the hp board a “separation from service” as defined in section 409a of the code or b april 1 of a given year however nonemployee directors may not defer the issuance of shares received upon the exercise of their stock options 

the chairman of the board receives an additional 200000 annual cash retainer in recognition of the greater duties that the position requires in addition to the regular annual cash and equity retainers and the chairman retainer described above the nonemployee directors who served as chairs of standing committees during fiscal 2019 received cash retainers for such service the board approved annual cash retainers for committee chairs as follows for chair service during fiscal 2019 

 each nonemployee director also receives 2000 for board meetings attended in excess of ten meetings per board year which begins in march and ends the following february and 2000 for each committee meeting attended in excess of a total of ten meetings of each committee per board year 

nonemployee directors are reimbursed for their expenses in connection with attending board meetings including expenses related to spouses when spouses are invited to attend board events and they may use the company aircraft for travel to and from board meetings and other company events

 item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 

director independence 

our corporate governance guidelines which are available on our website at httpsinvestorhpcomgovernancegovernancedocumentsdefaultaspx  provide that a substantial majority of the board will consist of independent directors and that the board can include no more than three directors who are not independent directors the independence standards can be found as exhibit a to our corporate governance guidelines our director independence standards are consistent with and in some respects more stringent than the nyse director independence standards in addition each member of the audit committee meets the heightened independence standards required for audit committee members under the applicable listing and sec standards and each member of the hrc committee meets the heightened independence standards required for compensation committee members under the applicable listing standards and sec standards 

under our corporate governance guidelines a director will not be considered independent in the following circumstances 

 for these purposes an “immediate family” member includes a person’s spouse parents stepparents children stepchildren siblings mother and fatherinlaw sons and daughtersinlaw brothers and sistersinlaw and anyone other than domestic employees who shares the director’s home 

in determining independence the board reviews whether directors have any material relationship with hp an independent director must not have any material relationship with hp either directly or as a partner stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with hp nor any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director in assessing the materiality of a director’s relationship to hp the board considers all relevant facts and circumstances including consideration of the issues from the director’s standpoint and from the perspective of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation and is guided by the standards set forth above 

in making its independence determinations the board considered transactions occurring since the beginning of fiscal 2017 between hp and entities associated with the independent directors or their immediate family members in addition to the transactions described below under “fiscal 2019 relatedperson transactions” if any the board’s independence determinations included consideration of the following transactions 

current directors 

  

 as a result of this review the board has determined the transactions described above and below under “fiscal 2019 relatedperson transactions” if any would not interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director the board has also determined that with the exception of messrs lores and weisler i each of hp’s remaining directors including ms alvarez mr banerji mr bennett mr bergh ms brownphilpot dr burns ms citrino mr clemmer ms matsuoka mr mobley and mr suresh and ii each of the members of the audit committee the hrc committee and the ngsr committee has or had no material relationship with hp either directly or as a partner stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with hp and is or was independent within the meaning of the nyse and our director independence standards the board has determined that mr lores is not independent because of his status as our current president and ceo and mr weisler is not independent due to his prior service as our president and ceo until november 1 2019 and his subsequent role as senior executive advisor to the company 

related person transactions policies and procedures 

related person transactions policy 

we have adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between us and our nonemployee directors director nominees executive officers beneficial owners of more than 5 of hp’s stock and their respective immediate family members where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is expected to exceed 100000 in a single calendar year 

the policy provides that the ngsr committee reviews certain transactions subject to the policy and decides whether to approve or ratify those transactions in doing so the ngsr committee determines whether the transaction is in the best interests of hp in making that determination the ngsr committee considers among other factors it deems appropriate 

  

the ngsr committee has delegated authority to the chair of the ngsr committee to preapprove or ratify transactions where the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than 1 million 

a summary of any new transactions preapproved by the chair is provided to the full ngsr committee for its review at each of the ngsr committee’s regularly scheduled meetings

printing groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance 

 corporate investments 

corporate investments includes hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

 the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market we believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and subgeographic specificities for each of our businesses we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers for other customers and for consumers we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and small businesses and commercial resellers mainly targeting smbs and midmarket accounts 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers “oms” around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand additionally we manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or alternate sources of supply are readily available however we have relied on sole sources for some laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations mitigating the effect of a disruption for instance we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of a3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party not to renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the information technology “it” industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products we strive to make our products in an ethical and sustainable manner we have committed to building an efficient resilient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers’ demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce this provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus on diversity and inclusion gives us a solid base on which to build future growth 

research and development 

innovation across products services business models and processes is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see “risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2019 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 27000 patents 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is essential to hp as a whole or to any of hp’s business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property “ip” from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see “risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” “risk factors—our products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties” and “risk factors—thirdparty claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of some product life cycles 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see “risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings and our sustainability performance 

the markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments 

the competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below 

personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions the pc market units showed marginal growth our primary competitors are lenovo group limited dell inc acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation and samsung electronics co ltd in particular geographies we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or “white box” manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our designs our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing  the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products our primary competitors include canon inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation ltd seiko epson corporation the ricoh company ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer nonoriginal supplies including imitation refill and 

remanufactured alternatives which are often available for lower prices but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to hp original inkjet and toner supplies these and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers or distributors or such resellers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost nonoriginal supplies our competitive advantages include our comprehensive highquality solutions for the home office and publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features sustainability our brand and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors see “risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products and their safe use 

we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account among other things published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment 

we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as “product takeback legislation” we are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption reusing or recycling we intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs 

in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws or standards our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations supply chain and our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements as these and other new laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines we strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more costeffective and less greenhouse gasintensive technology solutions to our customers we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business this commitment is reflected and outlined in our sustainability policy our comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

our business faces many challenges we must address one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends which may include declines in the markets in which we operate for example a competitive pricing environment and weakened market in certain geographies with associated customer pricing sensitivity has presented market challenges in printing a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our global multitier distribution network limit potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners adapt to new or changing marketplaces or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we have in the recent past and may again in the future face macroeconomic challenges including weakness in certain geographic regions and global political developments that impact international trade such as trade disputes and increased tariffs we may also be vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address such challenges given the broad range of geographic markets in which we and our customers and partners operate if we experience these challenges and do not succeed in our efforts to mitigate them or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application 

software and internet infrastructure offerings and our sustainability performance if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is a negative reception to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could also decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example nonoriginal supplies including imitation refill or remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

customers are increasingly using online and omnichannel resellers and distributors to purchase our products these resellers and distributors often sell our products alongside competing products including nonoriginal supplies or they may highlight the availability of lower cost nonoriginal supplies we expect this competition will continue and it may negatively impact our financial performance particularly if large commercial customers purchase competing products instead of hp products 

if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories and adapt to new and changing marketplaces for our products for example our gotomarket strategy including online omnichannel and contractual sales needs to evolve inline with market dynamics forces and demand if we cannot innovate develop and execute evolutionary strategies in this changing environment then we may not be able to successfully compete and maintain the value proposition of our products including supplies any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share cash flows results of operations and financial condition for example our strategy includes advancing our position in the personal systems and printing markets in personal systems we are 

focused on reinventing computing experiences growing the lifetime value of our products and accelerating services and solutions in printing we are focused on driving print innovation maximizing the value of our installed base of printers accelerating our contractual business model and pivoting our business models to providing customers choice our strategy also includes disrupting in our industrial businesses primarily by expanding our graphics and 3d printing solutions and unlocking new sources of value from microfluidics 

we must optimize our cost structure make longterm investments develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives or other investments may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel and our customers may not adopt our new business models 

our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones our competitors may also create products that replace ours as a result any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

if we cannot continue to produce highquality and secure products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes unsatisfactory performance under service contracts and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in thirdparty components included in our products including security vulnerabilities as illustrated by the “spectre” and “meltdown” sidechannel exploit threats in order to address quality and security issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement effective solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors particularly with respect to defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties 

if we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality and security issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality and security issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance in the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with thirdparty components we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation techniques such as firmware updates furthermore mitigation techniques for vulnerabilities in thirdparty components may be ineffective or may result in adverse performance system instability and data loss or corruption if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers’ expectations in addition quality and security issues including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in thirdparty components can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

the net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our net revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue 

which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers increased tariffs component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may also have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs increased tariffs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations for example our supplies business has recently experienced declining revenues due to declines in market share installed base and usage and increased customer pricing sensitivity our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business thirdparty suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations due to the international nature of our thirdparty supplier network our financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers and increased tariffs which could increase the cost of certain components products and services that we may not be able to offset in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers risks related to supply chain working conditions and materials sourcing and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 



services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these developments could adversely affect our future cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins any failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or reduced assortments of our products moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial 

resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends they may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors’ financial conditions abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges our forecasts may not accurately predict demand and distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods including a multitiered channel may reduce our visibility into inventories demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products could also make our forecasting more difficult and impact pricing in the market if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors in addition factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest by revenues many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively “business combination and investment transactions” risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 



 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill tangible or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include impairment charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive 

and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring plans in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs including the plans announced in october 2016 which we amended in may 2018 and the plan announced in october 2019 we began implementing the 2020 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to complete the restructuring by the end of fiscal 2022 implementation of any restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all or the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency adverse effects on employee morale loss of key employees andor other retention issues during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property “ip” laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain ip rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our ip rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such ip rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of our ip rights of our inkjet printer supplies against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip rights may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties  

some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or 

such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our ip thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our ip without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our ip rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these ip rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights finally we may rely on thirdparties to enforce certain ip rights for instance we rely on canon to enforce ip rights associated with certain laserjet products failure by canon to do so could impair our ability to protect our market share for those products 

thirdparty claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their ip rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase ip assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed ip at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that ip claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business claims of ip infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us additionally claims of ip infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships 

further our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon it equipment such as pcs multifunction devices and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

individuals or organizations including malicious computer programmers and hackers statesponsored organizations or nationstates may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns such individuals or organizations also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and 

business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our ip or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business additionally the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business while we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security problems such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches moreover these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures in some instances we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time in the past we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized use of our systems or those of third parties which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business and result in government enforcement actions and litigation and potential liability for us for example the gdpr imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4 of worldwide annual turnover andor €20 million we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure including portions provided by third parties also may experience interruptions outages delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations migration work or other causes from time to time any such events could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive than planned such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly 

the risks that accompany our services businesses differ from those of our other businesses for example the success of our services business depends to a significant degree on attracting clients to our services retaining these clients and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from these clients our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option andor subject to cancellation rights with penalties for early termination we may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our clients or our clients may reduce the scope of the services they contract for factors that may influence contract termination nonrenewal or reduction include business downturns dissatisfaction with our services or products attached to services we provide our retirement or lack of support for our services our clients selecting alternative technologies to replace us the cost of our services as compared to the cost of services offered by our competitors general market conditions or other reasons we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost clients or reductions in services while our services agreements typically include penalties for early termination these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses in the event a client terminates a services agreement early or reduces the scope of the agreement our clients could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future in addition the pricing and other terms of some of our services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the product margin of our services business as a result we may not generate the revenues we may have anticipated from our services businesses within the timelines anticipated if at all 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract be able to hire retain train motivate develop transition and deploy qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we have in the past experienced the impacts of macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions and markets and we may experience similar impacts in the future ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services political developments impacting international trade including continued uncertainty surrounding brexit trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the united states and china may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions or drive political or national sentiment weakening demand for our products and services 

economic weakness and uncertainty and political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade including the willingness of nonus consumers to purchase goods or services from us corporations may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit or if any of our distributors including wholesale and retail distributors lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately 65 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019 came from outside the united states in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

beginning in 2018 the united states commenced certain trade actions including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from china and other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could increase the cost of our products and the components that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact our overall gross margin and profitability tariffs could also make our products more expensive for customers which could make our products less competitive and reduce demand 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars global economic events including trade disputes 

economic sanctions and emerging market volatility and associated uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate which may contribute to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound continued uncertainty regarding brexit may result in future exchange rate volatility in addition in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established because a majority of our revenues are generated outside the united states fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of sales 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations in addition global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into north and south america our operations and those of our significant suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason such as those listed above or other economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers our distributors and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their orders which may adversely affect our results of operations 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows 

our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement in addition tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example the organization for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” has recently recommended changes to numerous longstanding international tax principles if countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright for example we are subject to laws regulations and standards concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling reuse treatment and disposal of our products including print supplies and batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product reparability reuse and takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies past downgrades of hewlettpackard company’s ratings increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and reduced market capacity for our commercial paper future 

downgrades could have the same effects and could also require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industryspecific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report for example we make significant estimates and assumptions when accounting for revenue recognition taxes on earnings and restructuring and other charges in addition as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks related to the separation 

the allocation of ip rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation and the shared use of certain ip rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain ip rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the ip assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of ip in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp’s trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp in addition as a result of the allocation of ip as part of the separation we no longer own ip allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting ip ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that for us federal income tax purposes the separation qualified for both the company and our stockholders as a taxfree reorganization within the meaning of sections 368d1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we andor our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise entered into several agreements including among others a separation and distribution agreement and an employee matters agreement the separation and distribution agreement and employee matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations hewlett packard enterprise has spun off or separated certain of its businesses since the separation and some of its obligations under these and other agreements have transferred to the successor entities we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities has separated are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

financial condition and results of operations continued 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices imaging and printing products and related technologies solutions and services we sell to individual consumers smbs and large enterprises including customers in the government health and education sectors we have three reportable segments personal systems printing and corporate investments the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook pcs workstations thin clients commercial mobility devices retail pos systems displays and other related accessories software support and services the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware supplies solutions and services as well as scanning devices corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects 

 we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends such as forecasted declining pc client markets and home printing markets a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape with increasing online and omnichannel presence additional challenges we face at the segment level are set forth below 

 our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions accordingly we face global macroeconomic challenges tariffdriven headwinds uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates weaker macroeconomic conditions and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment the full impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time 

to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes analytics and efficiencies we also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals improving channel execution and inventory management strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus strengthening our pricing discipline and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities 

specifically in october 2019 we announced costreduction and operational efficiency initiatives intended to simplify the way we work move closer to our customers and facilitate specific investment in our business these efforts include transforming our operating model to integrate our sales force into a single commercial organization and reducing structural costs across the company through our restructuring plan approved in september 2019 the “fiscal 2020 plan” we expect to invest some of the savings from these efforts across our businesses including investing to build our digital capabilities over time we expect these investments will make us more efficient and allow us to advance our positions in personal systems and printing while also disrupting new industries where we see attractive medium to longterm growth opportunities however the rate at which we are able to invest in our business and the returns that we are able to achieve from these investments will be

affected by many factors including the efforts to address the execution industry and macroeconomic challenges facing our business as discussed above as a result we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and the anticipated benefits of these efforts may not materialize 

we typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states “us” generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp’s board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 “overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we evaluate customers’ ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience financial metrics and customer credit scores 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions there are contracts which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of performance obligations that are distinct the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations 

we evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct good or services a performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract 

transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer if the transaction price includes a variable amount we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method we reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns we use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on historical experience expected consumer behavior and market conditions 

when a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations such as hardware andor services we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price the selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price “ssp” we establish ssp using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

separately “observable price” and in some instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority when observable price is not available we establish ssp based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement in most arrangements with multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price 

revenue is recognized when or as a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer we generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms for fixed price support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of standready obligations payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the duration of the contract in instances when revenue is derived from sales of thirdparty vendor products or services we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor we consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 18 of annual net revenue 

restructuring and other charges 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements other charges include nonrecurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs incurred in connection with the separation or information technology rationalization efforts for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in “results of operations” below and in note 3 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2019  



taxes on earnings 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” made significant changes to the us tax law the tcja lowered our us statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings 

in december 2017 the sec staff issued sab no 118 which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a one year “measurement period” in january 2019 we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tcja with no material changes to the provisional amounts recorded during the measurement period 

in january 2018 the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global minimum tax provisions of tcja the global minimum tax provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations we have elected to treat the global minimum tax inclusions as period costs 

as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027 

material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate the effects of the tcja related to these policies are referenced and discussed in detail in note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions pension and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent thirdparties to perform an appraisal when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or perform a quantitative impairment test based on a qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be performed 

in the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions we base the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019  resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as a result we concluded that a quantitative impairment test was not necessary 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and existing assets and liabilities we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency interest rate and return on certain investments exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2019  the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was 24 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 392 million and 166 million  respectively as of october 31 2019  

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 9 “fair value” and note 10 “financial instruments” respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property “ip” commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” are not a meaningful indicator of hp’s potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2019  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplement the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue with the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly average exchange rates from the comparative period and hedging activities from the prioryear period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results the constant currency measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



  

net revenue 

in fiscal year 2019 total net revenue increased 05 increased 20 on a constant currency basis as compared to the prioryear period net revenue from the united states remained flat at 206 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 07 to 382 billion the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks desktops and workstations in personal systems partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and a decline in printing supplies 

in fiscal year 2018 total net revenue increased 123 increased 101 on a constant currency basis as compared to the prioryear period net revenue from the united states increased 66 to 206 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 157 to 379 billion the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks desktops supplies commercial printing hardware revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts 

a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under “segment information” below 

gross margin 

our gross margin was 190 for fiscal year 2019 compared with 182 for fiscal year 2018 the increase was primarily due to higher rate in personal systems driven by lower supply chain costs 

our gross margin was 182 for fiscal year 2018 compared with 184 for fiscal year 2017 the decrease was primarily due to higher commercial hardware unit placements in printing and an increase in commodity and logistics costs in personal systems partially offset by higher pricing in personal systems and favorable foreign currency impacts 

a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “segment information” below 

operating expenses 

research and development “rd” 

rd expense increased 7 in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to continuing investments in innovation and key growth initiatives

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges increased by 143 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to charges from the fiscal 2020 plan and the restructuring plan approved in october 2016 the “fiscal 2017 plan” which was later amended in may 2018 

restructuring and other charges decreased by 230 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to lower charges from the fiscal 2017 plan 

acquisitionrelated charges 

acquisitionrelated charges for the fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 relate primarily to thirdparty professional and legal fees and integrationrelated costs as well as fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory

interest and other net 

interest and other net expense increased by 536 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to tax indemnifications related to the termination of the tax matters agreement “tma” with hewlett packard enterprise during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 

interest and other net expense increased by 726 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the reversal of indemnification receivables from hewlett packard enterprise pertaining to various income tax audit settlements and loss on extinguishment of debt 

benefit from provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 249 768 and 229 in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in fiscal year 2019 our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the resolution of various audits changes in valuation allowances and impacts of us tax reform in fiscal year 2018 our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 233 primarily due to transitional impacts of us tax reform and resolution of various audits and tax litigation in fiscal year 2017 our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore china malaysia and ireland additionally the overall effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 was impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and state income taxes 

for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 233 and 35 in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

realignment 

effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019 we implemented an organizational change to align our business unit financial reporting more closely with our current business structure the organizational change resulted in the transfer of certain samsungbranded product categories from commercial to consumer within the printing segment we reflected this change to our business unit information in prior reporting periods on an asif basis the reporting change had no impact to previously reported segment net revenue consolidated net revenue earnings from operations net earnings or net earnings per share “eps”

fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 

printing net revenue decreased 36 decreased 30 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2019 as compared to prioryear period the decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in supplies consumer hardware revenue and unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by an increase in commercial hardware revenue net revenue for supplies decreased 48 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to demand weakness printer unit volume 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

decreased 48 compared to the prioryear period the decrease in printer unit volume was driven by unit decrease in consumer hardware 

net revenue for commercial hardware increased 22 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the acquisition of the apogee group 

net revenue for consumer hardware decreased 67 as compared to the prioryear period due to a 54 decrease in printer unit volume and 17 decrease in asps the unit volume decrease was driven by inkjet home consumer business and laserjet home business the decrease in asps was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 01 percentage points for the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to higher gross margin the gross margin increased primarily due to rate improvement in commercial hardware partially offset by lower supplies revenue 

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

printing net revenue increased 111 increased 95 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2018 as compared to prioryear period the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the increase in supplies and hardware revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts net revenue for supplies increased 84 as compared to the prioryear period including the acquisition of samsung’s printer business printer unit volume increased 127 while asps increased 17 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in printer unit volume was primarily driven by unit increases in commercial and consumer hardware including the samsungbranded printers printer asps increased primarily due to favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by the dilution impact from samsungbranded lowend a4 products

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 09 percentage points for the fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and lower gross margin the gross margin decreased primarily due to lower supplies mix and the dilution impact of samsungbranded lowend products partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts and operational improvements operating expenses increased primarily driven by the acquisition of samsung’s printer business and increases in investments in key growth initiatives and gotomarket 

corporate investments 

the loss from operations in corporate investments for the fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to expenses associated with hp labs and our incubation and investment projects 

liquidity and capital resources   

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures acquisitions restructuring activities maturing debt income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a which are incorporated herein by reference 

our cash and cash equivalents balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with the majority of those amounts held outside of the united states we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the united states the tcja made significant changes to the us tax law including a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings the payments associated with this onetime transition tax will be paid over eight years and began in fiscal year 2019 we expect a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

will no longer be subject to us income tax consequences upon a subsequent repatriation to the united states as a result of the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax consequences upon repatriation as we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds including reducing our gross debt level or other uses 

liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents marketable debt securities and total debt were as follows 



 our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



operating activities   

net cash provided by operating activities increased marginally by 01 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 09 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and cash generated from working capital management activities 

working capital metrics 

management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level the table below presents the cash conversion cycle 



the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

2018 the increase in dso compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively was primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity 

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2019 the decrease in dos compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to reduction in inventory driven by reclassification of certain balances to other current assets pursuant to adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for fiscal year 2018 the dos was lower primarily due to a focus on inventory management 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2019 the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2018 was higher primarily due to working capital management activities partially offset by lower inventory purchasing volume for fiscal year 2018 the dpo remained flat compared to fiscal year 2017 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 03 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to lower net payments for acquisitions 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 10 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a decrease in investments classified as availableforsale investments within other current assets by 16 billion  and collateral related to our derivatives of 04 billion  partially offset by the payment of 10 billion for the acquisition of samsung’s printer business 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 08 billion in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to lower payment of debt of 15 billion partially offset by a decrease in outstanding commercial paper amounts of 07 billion 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 44 billion in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the payment to repurchase approximately 185 billion of debt higher share repurchase amount of 11 billion and higher outstanding commercial paper of 09 billion in fiscal year 2017 

capital resources 

debt levels   



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

shortterm debt decreased by 11 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a decrease in outstanding commercial paper amounts of 09 billion 

longterm debt decreased by 22 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the payment to repurchase approximately 185 billion in aggregate principal amount of us dollar global notes 

our debttoequity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders’ deficit our debttoequity ratio changed by 51x in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ deficit balance of 06 billion  

our debttoequity ratio changed by 71x in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ deficit balance of 28 billion  

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 10 “financial instruments” in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

available borrowing resources 

we had the following resources available to obtain short or longterm financing 



the 2016 shelf registration statement will expire in december 2019 around which time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement 

as of october 31 2019 we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of 40 billion that will be available until march 30 2023 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes 

for more information on our borrowings see note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facility have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of any such downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we can access alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facility if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

offbalance sheet arrangements   

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we have thirdparty shortterm financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers for more information on our thirdparty shortterm financing arrangements see note 7 “supplementary financial information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in over 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2019 were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the japanese yen and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent in cost of sales in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2019 and 2018  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2019 and 2018  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 81 million and 75 million at october 31 2019 and october 31 2018  respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2019 and 2018  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2019 and 2018  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 49 million at october 31 2019 and 69 million at october 31 2018

printing groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance 

 corporate investments 

corporate investments  includes hp labs and certain business incubation projects 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

 the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts to the regional and subregional specificities for each of our businesses each of our businesses and regions manages the definition and execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers for other customers and for consumers we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and small businesses and commercial resellers mainly targeting smbs and midmarket accounts 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers “oms” around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use 

multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand additionally we manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or alternate sources of supply are readily available however we have relied on sole sources for some laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations mitigating the effect of a disruption for instance we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of a3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party not to renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the information technology “it” industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products we strive to make our products in an ethical and sustainable manner we have committed to building an efficient resilient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers’ demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce this provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus on diversity and inclusion gives us a solid base on which to build future growth 

research and development 

innovation across products services business models and processes is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see “risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2018 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 26000 patents including patents acquired from samsung 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is essential to hp as a whole or to any of hp’s business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property “ip” from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see “risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of some product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see “risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings and our sustainability performance 

the markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments 

the competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below 

personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition the pc market unit decline has moderated while market revenue has improved due to higher average selling prices our primary competitors are lenovo group limited dell inc acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation and samsung electronics co ltd in particular regions we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or “white box” manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our design our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing  the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products our primary competitors include canon inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation ltd seiko epson corporation the ricoh company ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for hp original inkjet and toner supplies which are often available for lower prices but generally offer lower print quality and reliability other competitors also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hp’s laser and inkjet products particularly outside of the united states where ip protection is inadequate or ineffective our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high quality solutions for the home office and publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our brand and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors see “risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products and their safe use 

we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account among other things published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment 

we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as “product takeback legislation” we intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs 

in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations supply chain and our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change we strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more costeffective and less greenhouse gasintensive technology solutions to our customers as these and other new laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with our sustainability policy our comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

our business faces many challenges we must address one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends which may include declines in the markets in which we operate a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we have in the recent past and may again in the future face macroeconomic challenges including weakness in certain geographic regions and global political developments that impact international trade such as trade disputes and increased tariffs we may also be vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address such challenges given the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we experience these challenges and do not succeed in our efforts to mitigate them or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support and security if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is a negative reception to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could also decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example the refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses our strategy is to successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics scale our 3d printing managed print services and device as a service businesses and execute on our personal systems growth strategy by providing specialized products and services that address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones our competitors may also create products that replace ours as a result any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes unsatisfactory performance under service contracts and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in thirdparty components included in our products including security vulnerabilities as illustrated by the recent “spectre” and “meltdown” sidechannel exploit threats in order to address quality and security issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement effective solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors particularly with respect to defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties 

if we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality and security issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality and security issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance in the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with thirdparty components we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation techniques such as firmware updates furthermore mitigation techniques for vulnerabilities in thirdparty components may be ineffective or may result in adverse performance system instability and data loss or corruption if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers’ expectations in addition quality and security issues including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in thirdparty components can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars global economic events including trade disputes economic sanctions and emerging market volatility and associated uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate which may contribute to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound continued uncertainty regarding brexit may result in future exchange rate volatility in addition in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of sales 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we have in the past experienced the impacts of macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions and markets and we may experience similar impacts in the future ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect 

macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services political developments impacting international trade including continued uncertainty surrounding brexit trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the united states and china may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions 

economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses 

the net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our net revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may also have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or reduced assortments of our products moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively 

affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors’ financial conditions abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business thirdparty suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations due to the international nature of our thirdparty supplier network our financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers and tariffs in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers risks related to supply chain working conditions and materials sourcing and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 



components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

 business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason such as those listed above or other economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being 

consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest by revenues many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately 65 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2018 came from outside the united states in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 



the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively “business combination and investment transactions” risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill tangible or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired 

we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include impairment charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we announced a restructuring plan in october 2016 which we amended in may 2018 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs implementation of the restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all or the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our october 2016 restructuring plan see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property “ip” laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain ip rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our ip rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such ip rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of our ip rights of our inkjet printer supplies against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip rights may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties  

some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our ip thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our ip without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our ip rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these ip rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their ip rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase ip assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed ip at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that ip claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business claims of ip infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us additionally claims of ip infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships 

further our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon it equipment such as pcs multifunction devices and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could 

be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

the allocation of ip rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation and the shared use of certain ip rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain ip rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the ip assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of ip in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp’s trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp in addition as a result of the allocation of ip as part of the separation we no longer own ip allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting ip ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly 

the risks that accompany our services businesses differ from those of our other businesses for example the success of our services business depends to a significant degree on attracting clients to our services retaining these clients and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from these clients our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option andor subject to cancellation rights with penalties for early termination we may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our clients or our clients may reduce the scope of the services they contract for factors that may influence contract termination nonrenewal or reduction include business downturns dissatisfaction with our services or products attached to services we provide our retirement or lack of support for our services our clients selecting alternative technologies to replace us the cost of our services as compared to the cost of services offered by our competitors general market conditions or other reasons we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost clients or reductions in services while our services agreements typically include penalties for early termination these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses in the event a client terminates a services agreement early or reduces the scope of the agreement our clients could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future in addition the pricing and other terms of some of our services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the product margin of our services business as a result we may not generate the revenues we may have anticipated from our services businesses within the timelines anticipated if at all 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industryspecific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies past downgrades of hewlettpackard company’s ratings increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and reduced market capacity for our commercial paper future downgrades could have the same effects and could also require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition uncertainties related to the interpretation of the tcja could materially impact our tax obligations and effective tax rate as well as our business strategy and tax planning 

our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws in addition various tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered that could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example the organization for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” has recently recommended changes to numerous longstanding international tax principles if countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract be able to hire retain train motivate develop transition and deploy qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers including statesponsored organizations or nationstates may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business while we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security problems such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches in the past we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized use of our systems or those of third parties which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business and result in government enforcement actions and litigation and potential liability for us for example the gdpr imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4 of worldwide annual turnover andor €20 million we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure including portions provided by third parties also may experience interruptions outages delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations migration work or other causes from time to time any such events could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive than planned such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock 

risks related to the separation 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that for us federal income tax purposes the separation qualified for both the company and our stockholders as a taxfree reorganization within the meaning of sections 368d1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we andor our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise entered into several agreements including among others a separation and distribution agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement and a commercial agreement the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations hewlett packard enterprise has spun off or separated certain of its businesses since the separation and some of its obligations under these and other agreements have transferred to the successor entities we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities has separated are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

financial condition and results of operations continued 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices imaging and printing products and related technologies solutions and services we sell to individual consumers smbs and large enterprises including customers in the government health and education sectors we have three reportable segments personal systems printing and corporate investments the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook pcs workstations thin clients commercial mobility devices retail pos systems displays and other related accessories software support and services the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware supplies solutions and services as well as scanning devices corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation projects 

 we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends such as forecasted declining pc client markets and flat home printing markets a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

 our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions accordingly we face global macroeconomic challenges tariffdriven headwinds uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates weaker macroeconomic conditions and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment the impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time 

to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we continue to work on improving our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities 

we typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance

separation transaction 

 on november 1 2015 we completed the separation of hewlett packard enterprise hewlettpackard company’s former enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses and entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between hp and hewlett packard enterprise going forward including among others a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement and a master commercial agreement 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states “us” generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp’s board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 “overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority we evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale 

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 18 and 20 of annual net revenue respectively 

restructuring and other charges 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements other charges include nonrecurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in “results of operations” below and in note 3 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2018  



taxes on earnings 

the tax cuts and jobs act “the tcja” made significant changes to the us tax law the tcja lowered our us statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018 we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 760 million as a provisional estimate under the sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 

in december 2017 the sec staff issued sab no 118 which addresses how a company recognizes provisional estimates when a company does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the tcja the measurement period ends when a company has obtained prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting but cannot extend beyond one year the final impact of the tcja may differ from the provisional estimates due to changes in interpretations of the tcja legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tcja changes in accounting standard for income taxes and related interpretations in response to the tcja and updates or changes to estimates used in the provisional amounts in fiscal year 2018 we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 760 million related to the 56 billion net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings partially offset by a 33 billion net expense for the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments over eight years a 12 billion net expense for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new us statutory tax rate and a 317 million net expense related to realization on us deferred taxes that are expected to be realized at a lower rate resolution of the provisional estimates of the tcja effects that are different from the assumptions made by us could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

prior to the enactment of the tcja our effective tax rate included the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we had planned to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027 

material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate the effects of the tcja related to these policies are referenced and discussed in detail in note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 60 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions pension and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent thirdparties to perform an appraisal when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or perform a quantitative impairment test based on a qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be performed 

in the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions we base the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018  resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as a result we concluded that a quantitative impairment test was not necessary 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2018  the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was 24 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 515 million  and 195 million  respectively as of october 31 2018  

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 9 “fair value” and note 10 “financial instruments” respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property “ip” commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” are not a meaningful indicator of hp’s potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2018  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations   

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplement the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue with the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly average exchange rates from the comparative period and hedging activities from the prioryear period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results the constant currency measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



  

net revenue 

in fiscal year 2018 total net revenue increased 123 increased 101 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal year 2017 net revenue from the united states increased 66 to 206 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 157 to 379 billion the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks desktops supplies commercial printing hardware revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts 

in fiscal year 2017 total net revenue increased 79 increased 87 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal year 2016 net revenue from the united states increased 71 to 193 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 84 to 328 billion the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks desktops and supplies revenue partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts

gross margin 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

our gross margin was 182 for fiscal year 2018 compared with 184 for fiscal year 2017 the decrease was primarily due to higher commercial hardware unit placements in printing and an increase in commodity and logistics costs in personal systems partially offset by higher pricing in personal systems and favorable foreign currency impacts 

our gross margin was 184 for fiscal year 2017 compared with 187 for fiscal year 2016 the primary factors impacting the gross margin decrease were lower personal system gross margin driven by higher commodity costs unfavorable foreign currency impacts and a higher mix of personal systems revenue partially offset by productivity improvements in printing 

a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “segment information” below 

operating expenses 

research and development “rd” 

rd expense increased 18 in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to continuing investment in printing including the acquisition of samsung’s printer business 

rd expense decreased 2 in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower spend as a result of the launch of a3 products in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by continuing investment in printing

benefit from provision for taxes 

as a result of us tax reform a blended us federal statutory rate of 23 was computed for the fiscal year ending october 31 2018 our effective tax rates were 768 229 and 291 in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in fiscal year 2018 our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 233 primarily due to transitional impacts of us tax reform and resolution of various audits and tax litigation in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore china malaysia and

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

  

printing net revenue increased 111 increased 95 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2018 the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the increase in supplies and hardware revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts net revenue for supplies increased 84 as compared to the prioryear period including the acquisition of samsung’s printer business printer unit volume increased 127 while asps increased 16 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in printer unit volume was primarily driven by unit increases in commercial and consumer hardware including the samsungbranded printers printer asps increased primarily due to favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by the dilution impact from samsungbranded lowend a4 products

gross margin decreased primarily due to lower supplies mix and the dilution impact of samsungbranded lowend products partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts and operational improvements operating expenses increased primarily driven by the acquisition of samsung’s printer business and increases in investments in key growth initiatives and gotomarket 

fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 

printing net revenue increased 33 increased 39 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2017 the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the increase in supplies revenue net revenue for supplies increased 45 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the change in the supplies sales model in the prioryear period and better discount management partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts printer unit volume increased 34 while asps decreased 09 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in printer unit volume was primarily driven by unit increases in consumer hardware and larger opportunity to place incremental units with positive net present value printer asps decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

net revenue for commercial hardware is flat as compared to the prioryear period driven by a decline in other printing solutions largely due to the divestiture of marketing optimization assets in the prioryear period offset by revenue from managed print services and 3d printing in fiscal year 2017 asps decreased by 01 while unit volume increased by 20 the unit volume increased primarily due to a larger opportunity to place incremental units with positive net present value the decrease in asps was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by a mix shift to higherend printers

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 04 percentage points for the fiscal year 2017 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by an improved gross margin the gross margin increased due to operational improvements partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts operating expenses increased primarily due to a gain from the divestiture of marketing optimization assets in the prioryear period and an increase in marketing investments 

corporate investments 

the loss from operations in corporate investments for the fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to expenses associated with hp labs and our incubation projects 

liquidity and capital resources   

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures acquisitions restructuring activities maturing debt income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a which are incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with the majority of those amounts held outside of the united states we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

on november 1 2018 we made a cash payment of 422 million in connection with the acquisition of the apogee group a uk based office equipment dealer “oed” and provider of print outsourced services and document and process technology the cash payment is subject to customary closing and other adjustments and would be finalized in future periods 

amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the united states the tcja made significant changes to the us tax law including a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings the payments associated with this onetime transition tax will be paid over eight years beginning 2019 we expect a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to us income tax consequences upon a subsequent repatriation to the united states as a result of the

transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax consequences upon repatriation as we evaluate the impact of the tcja and the future cash needs of our operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds including reducing our gross debt level or other uses

our cash and cash equivalents marketable debt securities and total debt were as follows 



 our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



operating activities   

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 09 billion  for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and cash generated from working capital management activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 04 billion  for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher cash generated from working capital management activities 

working capital metrics 

management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level the table below presents the cash conversion cycle 



the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal year 2018 the 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

increase in dso compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity for fiscal year 2017 the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to strong collections 

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2018 the dos was lower primarily due to a focus on inventory management for fiscal year 2017 the dos was higher primarily due to leveraging our balance sheet particularly through higher strategic buys and sea shipments to better assure supply of commodities in short supply 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2018 the dpo remained flat compared to fiscal year 2017 for fiscal year 2017 the dpo was higher primarily due to increased inventory purchases and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 10 billion  for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a decrease in investments classified as availableforsale investments within other current assets by 16 billion  and collateral related to our derivatives of 04 billion  partially offset by the payment of 10 billion  for the acquisition of samsung’s printer business 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 18 billion  for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to net investment activity of 11 billion  classified as availableforsale investments within other current assets collateral of 02 billion  related to our derivatives and proceeds from a business divestiture of 05 billion  in fiscal year 2016 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 44 billion  in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the payment to repurchase approximately 185 billion  of debt higher share repurchase amount of 11 billion  and higher outstanding commercial paper of 09 billion  in fiscal year 2017 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 132 billion  in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 as the net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year 2016 included the cash transfer of 104 billion  to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation and the redemption of 21 billion  of us dollar global notes and fiscal year 2017 included a higher outstanding commercial paper of 09 billion  

capital resources 

debt levels   



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

shortterm debt increased by 04 billion  and longterm debt decreased by 22 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to the payment to repurchase approximately 185 billion in aggregate principal amount of us dollar global notes 

shortterm debt increased by 10 billion  for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 the net increase in total debt was primarily due to a higher outstanding of commercial paper of 09 billion  

our debttoequity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders’ deficit our debttoequity ratio changed by 707x in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ deficit balance of 28 billion  

our debttoequity ratio changed by 054x in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to an increase in total debt balances of 10 billion

available borrowing resources 

we had the following resources available to obtain short or longterm financing 



as of october 31 2018 we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of 40 billion which will be available until march 30 2023 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes as of october 31 2018 we had 09 billion of commercial paper outstanding 

we increased our issuance authorization under our commercial paper program from 40 billion to 60 billion in november 2017 in december 2017 we also entered into an additional revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provided us with 15 billion of available borrowings until november 30 2018 we elected to terminate this 15 billion revolving credit facility early effective august 17 2018 

for more information on our borrowings see note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based on publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of any such downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we can access alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

actual cash payments for the tax to be much lower as we expect to reduce the overall liability by more than half once tax credits and other balance sheet tax attributes are used 

offbalance sheet arrangements   

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we have thirdparty shortterm financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers for more information on our thirdparty shortterm financing arrangements see note 7 “supplementary financial information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 44 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2018  were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the british pound and the indian rupee for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent in cost of sales in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2018  and 2017  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2018  and 2017  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 75 million and 64 million at october 31 2018  and october 31 2017  respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2018  and 2017  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2018  and 2017  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 69 million at october 31 2018  and 61 million at october 31 2017

printing groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance 

 corporate investments 

corporate investments  includes hp labs and certain business incubation projects 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

 the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our key business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers we typically manage direct online sales as well as 

channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers “oms” around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customer’s particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or alternate sources of supply are readily available however we have relied on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations mitigating the effect of a disruption for instance we source majority of our a4 and a portion of a3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party not to renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement 

we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the information technology “it” industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products we strive to make our products in an ethical and sustainable manner we have committed to building an efficient resilient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers’ demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce this provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus in diversity and inclusion gives us a solid base on which to build future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 2 “segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 63 of our overall net revenue in fiscal year 2017 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hp’s international operations see “risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a and note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation across products services business models and processes is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 12 billion in each of fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see “risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2017 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 18000 patents 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hp’s business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property “ip” from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see “risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of some product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see “risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings and our sustainability performance 

the markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments 

the competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below 

personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition the pc market unit decline has moderated while market revenue has improved due to higher average selling prices our primary competitors are lenovo group limited dell inc acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation and samsung electronics co ltd in particular regions we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or “white box” manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our design our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing  the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products our primary competitors include canon inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation ltd seiko epson corporation the ricoh company ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for hp original inkjet and toner supplies which are often available for lower prices but generally offer lower print quality and reliability other competitors also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hp’s laser and inkjet products particularly outside of the united states where ip protection is inadequate or ineffective our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high quality solutions for the home office and publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features our brand and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors see “risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability 

our approach to sustainability covers a broad range of sustainability issues across three pillars environment society and integrity we prioritize issues to address based on their relative importance to our culture business success and sustainable development 

environment  we are focused on reinventing the way that products are designed manufactured used and recovered as we shift our business model and operations toward a low carbon and circular economy that promotes greater energy efficiency resource productivity and waste reduction working with our supply chain partners we strive to reduce the environmental impact of our products at every stage of the value chain 

society  we are using our technology innovation and scale to promote a more just and inclusive society we strive to empower workers and provide protections for the people who make our products our agreements with our suppliers require that workers receive fair treatment safe working conditions and freely chosen employment we work to enforce these requirements with suppliers through proactive engagement and training and corrective action plans when needed working with business and nonprofit partners we deploy our technology capital and resources to advance quality learning outcomes and digital inclusion 

integrity  we are committed to acting with integrity fairness and accountability which we believe are fundamental to an inclusive society and a thriving business we also expect ethical behavior by our employees partners and suppliers and we have structures programs and processes in place to safeguard human rights across our value chain 

goals  our current longterm sustainability goals are 

climate change 

 natural resources 

 society 

 integrity 

 for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products and their safe use 

we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account among other things published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment 

we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as “product takeback legislation” we intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs 

in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change we strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations and product portfolio and deliver more costeffective and less greenhouse gasintensive technology solutions to our customers as these and other new laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with our sustainability policy our comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors see “risk factors—our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference in addition for a discussion of our environmental contingencies see note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is also incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

our business faces many challenges we must address one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends which may include declines in the markets in which we operate a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in emerging markets and europe and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support and security if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price 

pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics develop and introduce 3d printers and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones our competitors may also create products that replace ours as a result any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers’ 

expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate in addition the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of sales 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example until recently we experienced the impacts of macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets and we may experience similar impacts in these or other regions in the future ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services the continuing uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s exit from the european union may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions 

economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses 

the net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our net revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our net revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors’ financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us 

other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers risks related to supply chain working conditions and materials sourcing and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 



products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel or the laser printer engines and toner cartridges that we obtain from canon alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason such as those listed above or other economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately 63 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017 came from outside the united states in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively “business combination and investment transactions” risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 



those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which such as our acquisition of samsung’s printer business may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 



 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we announced a restructuring plan in october 2016 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs implementation of the restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our october 2016 restructuring plan see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property “ip” rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties  

some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a 

consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

further our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

the allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp’s trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation we no longer own intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly 

the risks that accompany our services businesses differ from those of our other businesses for example the success of our services business depends to a significant degree on attracting clients to our services retaining these clients and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from these clients our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option andor subject to cancellation rights with penalties for early termination we may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our clients or our clients may reduce the scope of the services they contract for factors that may influence contract termination nonrenewal or reduction include business downturns dissatisfaction with our services or 

products attached to services we provide our retirement or lack of support for our services our clients selecting alternative technologies to replace us the cost of our services as compared to the cost of services offered by our competitors general market conditions or other reasons we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost clients or reductions in services while our services agreements typically include penalties for early termination these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses in the event a client terminates a services agreement early or reduces the scope of the agreement our clients could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future in addition the pricing and other terms of some of our services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the product margin of our services business as a result we may not generate the revenues we may have anticipated from our services businesses within the timelines anticipated if at all 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industryspecific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies prior to the separation fitch ratings moody’s investor service and standard  poor’s rating services had downgraded hewlettpackard company’s ratings past 

downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results in addition various tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered including potential tax reform within the united states that could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example the organization for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” has recently recommended changes to numerous longstanding international tax principles if countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract be able to hire retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers including statesponsored organizations or nationstates may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business while we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security problems such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches in the past we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized use of our systems which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock 

risks related to the separation 

the separation of hewlettpackard company into two independent publicly traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

on november 1 2015 we completed the separation of our enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses from our personal systems and printing businesses the process of completing the separation involved significant costs and expenses we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational marketing or other benefits from the separation as an independent publicly traded company we are a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to review our acquisitions dispositions and other transactions including those related to the separation in light of the economic and legislative environment 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that for us federal income tax purposes the separation qualified for both the company and our stockholders as a taxfree reorganization within the meaning of sections 368d1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we andor our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise entered into several agreements including among others a separation and distribution agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement and a commercial agreement the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations hewlett packard enterprise has spun off or separated certain of its businesses since the separation and some of its obligations under these and other agreements have transferred to the successor entities we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities has separated are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

overview 

we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices imaging and printing products and related technologies solutions and services we sell to individual consumers small and mediumsized businesses “smbs” and large enterprises including customers in the government health and education sectors we have three segments for financial reporting purposes personal systems printing and corporate investments the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer personal computers “pcs” workstations thin clients commercial tablets and mobility devices retail pointofsale systems displays and other related accessories software support and services for the commercial and consumer markets the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware supplies solutions and services as well as scanning devices corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation projects 

 we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends such as flat pc device and home printing markets a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

 our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions accordingly we face global macroeconomic challenges such as the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union commonly known as “brexit” uncertainty in the markets and weaker macroeconomic conditions the impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time 

to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities

we typically experience higher net revenues in our first and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states “us” generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp’s board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 “overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

  

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

  

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

  

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority we 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

  

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

  

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale 

  

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period 

  

warranty 

  

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 20 and 23 of annual net revenue respectively 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements other charges include nonrecurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in “results of operations” below and in note 3 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

  

retirement and postretirement benefits 

  

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement 

  

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2017  



  

taxes on earnings 

  

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

  

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided united states federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the united states federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027 material changes in our 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

inventory 

  

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

  

goodwill 

  

we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or perform a quantitative impairment test based on a qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be performed 

in the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions we base the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as a result we concluded that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary 

  fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2017  the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was 25 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 121 million  and 372 million  respectively as of october 31 2017  

  

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 9 “fair value” and note 10 “financial instruments” respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property “ip” commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14 “litigation and contingencies” are not a meaningful indicator of hp’s potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2017  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations   

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplement the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue with the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which excludes the change of foreign currency exchange fluctuations and hedging activities from the prioryear period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results the constant currency measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



  

net revenue 

  

in fiscal year 2017 total net revenue increased 79 increased 87 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal year 2016 net revenue from the united states increased 71 to 193 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 84 to 328 billion the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks desktops and supplies revenue partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

  

in fiscal year 2016 total net revenue decreased 63 decreased 20 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal year 2015 net revenue from the united states increased 17 to 180 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 104 to 302 billion the primary factors contributing to the net revenue decline were unfavorable foreign currency impacts weak market demand competitive pricing pressures and the change in the supplies sales model the net revenue decline was driven by decline in supplies commercial and consumer printers commercial and consumer desktops and consumer notebooks partially offset by growth in commercial notebooks 

  

a more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under “segment information” below 

gross margin 

our gross margin was 184 for fiscal year 2017 compared with 187 for fiscal year 2016 the primary factors impacting the gross margin decrease were lower personal system gross margin driven by higher commodity costs unfavorable foreign currency impacts and higher mix of personal systems revenue partially offset by productivity improvements in printing 

  

our gross margin was 187 for fiscal year 2016 compared with 193 for fiscal year 2015 the decline in gross margin performance was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by operational improvements

a more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “segment information” below 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development “rd” 

  

rd expense decreased 2 in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower spend as a result of the launch of a3 products in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by continuing investment in printing 

rd expense increased 2 in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to incremental investments in a3 and 3d printing partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  

sga expense increased 14 in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a gain from the divestiture of marketing optimization assets in fiscal year 2016 and an increase in field selling costs 

  

sga expense decreased 19 in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to gains from the divestiture of certain software assets to open text corporation lower corporate governance and other overhead costs related to the preseparation combined entity our costsaving initiatives and favorable foreign currency impacts these effects were partially offset by the gain from the divestiture of snapfish in the prioryear period 

amortization of intangible assets 

  

amortization expense decreased by 15 million and 86 million in fiscal year 2017 and in fiscal year 2016 respectively yearoveryear primarily due to assets from prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods 

restructuring and other charges 

  

restructuring and other charges increased by 157 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the restructuring plan announced in october 2016 the “fiscal 2017 plan” and certain nonrecurring costs including those as a result of the separation 

restructuring and other charges increased by 142 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to severance pay and infrastructure related charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in september 2015 the “fiscal 2015 plan” 

interest and other net 

  

interest and other net expense increased by 455 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prioryear period the increase was primarily due to lower tax indemnification income in fiscal year 2017 from hewlett packard enterprise for certain tax liabilities that hp is jointly and severally liable for but for which it is indemnified by hewlett packard enterprise under the tax matters agreement 

interest and other net expense decreased by 600 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prioryear period the decrease was primarily due to higher tax indemnification income in fiscal year 2016 from hewlett packard enterprise under the tax matters agreement and lower foreign currency losses partially offset by lower interest income 

  

provision for taxes 

  

our effective tax rates were 229 291 and 53 in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore china malaysia and ireland we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore have not provided 

hp inc and subsidiaries

financial condition and results of operations continued 

us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings in addition to the above factors the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2017 were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and state income taxes and the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2016 were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions

financial condition and results of operations continued 

net revenue for commercial hardware decreased 2 as compared to the prioryear period driven by a decline in other printing solutions largely due to the divestiture of marketing optimization assets in the prioryear period partially offset by revenue from 3d printing in fiscal year 2017 asps decreased by 01 while unit volume increased by 20 the unit volume increased primarily due to a larger opportunity to place incremental units with positive net present value the decrease in asps was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by a mix shift to higherend printers net revenue for consumer hardware increased 3 as compared to the prioryear period due to a 4 increase in printer unit volume partially offset by 04 decrease in asps the unit volume increase was driven by the home business the decrease in asps was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by better discount management

able to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a which is incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with the majority of those amounts held outside of the united states we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

on november 1 2017 hp made a cash payment of 11 billion to samsung electronics co ltd in connection with the acquisition of its printer business 

amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law some would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on amounts repatriated to the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations

operating activities   

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 04 billion  for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016the increase was primarily due to higher cash generated from working capital management activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 38 billion  for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 since the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 included the impact of discontinued operations which is not included in the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the separation 

working capital metrics 

management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level the table below presents the cash conversion cycle 



the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal year 2017 the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to strong collections for fiscal year 2016 the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to favorable revenue linearity and strong collections partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

         dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2017 the dos was higher primarily due to leveraging our balance sheet particularly through higher strategic buys and sea shipments to better assure supply of commodities in short supply for fiscal year 2016 the dos was flat compared to fiscal year 2015 due to strong inventory management offset by higher inventory balance to support future sales levels 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2017 the dpo was higher primarily due to increased inventory purchases and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers for fiscal year 2016 the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers and increased strategic inventory purchases 

investing activities 

         net cash used in investing activities increased by 18 billion  for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to net investment activity of 11 billion  classified as availableforsale investments within other current assets collateral of 02 billion  related to our derivatives and proceeds from a business divestiture of 05 billion  in fiscal year 2016 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 56 billion  for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to capital expenditures and payments made in connection with business acquisitions net of cash acquired in fiscal year 2015 by the discontinued operations 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 132 billion  in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 as the net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year 2016 included the cash transfer of 104 billion  to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation and the redemption of 21 billion  of us dollar global notes and fiscal year 2017 included a higher outstanding of commercial paper of 09 billion  

net cash used in financing activities increased by 152 billion  in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the cash transfer of 104 billion  to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation the redemption of 21 billion  of us dollar global notes and cash utilization of 20 billion  for repurchases of common stock and dividends

capital resources 

debt levels   



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

shortterm debt increased by 10 billion  for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 the net increase in total debt was primarily due to a higher outstanding of commercial paper of 09 billion  

shortterm debt decreased by 21 billion  and longterm debt increased by 01 billion  for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to the redemption of 21 billion  of fixed rate us dollar global notes in november 2015 

our debttoequity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders’ deficit equity our debttoequity ratio increased by 054x in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to an increase in total debt balances of 10 billion  

our debttoequity ratio decreased by 206x in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to negative equity resulting from the transfer of net assets of 325 billion  to hewlett packard enterprise and the redemption of 21 billion  of fixedrate us dollar global notes due to the separation 

during fiscal year 2017 and 2016 we generated operating cash flow of 37 billion  and 33 billion  respectively 

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 10 “financial instruments” in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

available borrowing resources 

we had the following resources available to obtain short or longterm financing 



as of october 31 2017 we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of 40 billion which will be available until april 2 2019 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes 

we increased our issuance authorization under our commercial paper program from 40 billion to 60 billion in november 2017 in december 2017 we also entered into a revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides us with 15 billion of available borrowings until november 30 2018 

for more information on our borrowings see note 11 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of any such downgrade could have a negative impact on

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 44 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2017  were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the british pound and the indian rupee for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent in cost of sales in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2017  and 2016  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2017  and 2016  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 64 million and 41 million at october 31 2017  and october 31 2016  respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2017  and 2016  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2017  and 2016  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 61 million at october 31 2017  and 51 million at october 31 2016

where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers we typically manage direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers “oms” around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customer’s particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption for instance we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any nonrenewal or limitation or reduction of the scope of our agreement with canon could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and do not anticipate nonrenewal of this agreement 

we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the information technology “it” industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see “risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability also plays a role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products some customer segments expect that our products are made in an ethical and sustainable manner which we strive to ensure through our sustainability programs we have committed to building an efficient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosure for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 3 “segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 63 of our overall net revenue in fiscal year 2016 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hp’s international operations see “risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a and note 12 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 12 billion in fiscal year 2016 12 billion in fiscal year 2015 and 13 billion in fiscal year 2014 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see “risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2016 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 18000 patents 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hp’s business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property “ip” from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see “risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see “risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings and our sustainability performance 

the markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments 

the competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below 

personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition the decline in the pc market has moderated though the pc market still faces uncertainty our primary competitors are lenovo group limited dell inc acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation and samsung electronics co ltd in particular regions we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or “white box” manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing  the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products our primary competitors include canon inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation ltd seiko epson corporation the ricoh company ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for hp original inkjet and toner supplies which are often available for lower prices but generally offer lower print quality and reliability other competitors also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hp’s laser and inkjet products particularly outside of the united states where ip protection is inadequate or ineffective our competitive advantages include our comprehensive solutions for the home office and publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities our brand and the accessibility of our products through a broadbased distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors see “risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

sustainability 

our approach to sustainability covers a broad range of sustainability issues across three pillars environment society and integrity we prioritize issues to address based on their relative importance to our business success and sustainable development 

environment  we are focused on reinventing the way that products are designed manufactured used and recovered as we shift our business model and operations toward a materials and energyefficient circular economy that promotes greater resource productivity and aims to reduce waste working with our supply chain partners we strive to reduce the environmental impact of our products at every stage of the value chain 

society  we strive to empower workers and ensure protections for the people who make our products our agreements with our suppliers require that workers receive fair treatment safe working conditions and freely chosen employment we work to enforce these requirements with suppliers through proactive engagement and training and corrective action plans when needed 

integrity  we are committed to acting with integrity fairness and accountability which we believe are fundamental to an inclusive society and a thriving business we also expect ethical behavior by our employees partners and suppliers and we have structures programs and processes in place to safeguard human rights across our value chain 

goals  our current longterm sustainability goals are 

 

for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products and their safe use 

we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment 

we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as “product takeback legislation” we intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs 

in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change we strive to continually improve the energy efficiency of our product portfolio and deliver more costeffective and less greenhouse gasintensive technology solutions to our customers as these and other new laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with our sustainability policy our comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors see “risk factors—our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations” in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference in addition for a discussion of our environmental contingencies see note 15 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is also incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the declines in the pc market and home printing a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in emerging markets and europe and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays 

in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support and security if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics develop and introduce 3d printers and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or acquire and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones our competitors may also create products that replace ours as a result any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers’ expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our results 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate in addition the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of sales 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services brexit and the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s exit from the european union has also begun to negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future 

economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses 

the net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our net revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our net revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of 

variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors’ financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers each of which is described below 



unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

sales outside the united states made up approximately 63 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2016 in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 



 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively “business combination and investment transactions” risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 



 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing for example our acquisition of samsung’s printer business is subject to regulatory review in numerous jurisdictions including south korea and the european union as well as customary closing conditions dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 



 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we announced a restructuring plan in october 2016 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs implementation of the restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our october 2016 restructuring plan see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property “ip” rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties  

some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

further our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

the allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp’s trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation we no longer own intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly 

the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 



unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services business 

 failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock for these reasons investors should 

not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies fitch ratings moody’s investor service and standard  poor’s rating services downgraded hewlettpackard company’s ratings in the past past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results in addition various tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered that could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any 

failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock 

risks related to the separation 

the separation of hewlettpackard company into two independent publicly traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

on november 1 2015 we completed the separation of our enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses from our personal systems and printing businesses the process of completing the separation involved significant costs and expenses uncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational marketing or other benefits from the separation as an independent publicly traded company we are a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to review our acquisitions dispositions and other transactions including those related to the separation in light of the economic and legislative environment 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that for us federal income tax purposes the separation qualified for both the company and our stockholders as a taxfree reorganization within the meaning of sections 368d1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax expenses resulting from the separation in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separation which may be material if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we andor our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise entered into several agreements including among others a transition services agreement a separation and distribution agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement a commercial agreement and an it service agreement the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hewlett packard enterprise and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use incorporation and bundling in oem products and services resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of hewlett packard enterprise’s subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for us we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hewlett packard enterprise is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc device market and home printing a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

 

 

we may also face challenges as a result of the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union commonly known as “brexit” the outcome of brexit and its impact on our business cannot be known until the terms and

timing of the united kingdom’s exit are clearer until that time we may face various brexitrelated challenges that may include uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates and weaker macroeconomic conditions 

to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states “us” generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp’s board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 “overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

  

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

  

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

  

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority we evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

  

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

  

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale 

  

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period 

  

warranty 

  

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 22 and 25 of annual net revenue respectively 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements other charges include nonrecurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in “results of operations” below and in note 4 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

  

retirement and postretirement benefits 

  

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long

term return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement 

  

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 5 “retirement and postretirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2016  



  

taxes on earnings 

  

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

  

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided united states federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the united 

hp inc and subsidiaries

states federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 7 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

inventory 

  

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

  

goodwill 

  

we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test based on the qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed 

in the first step of the impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions we base the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step we measure the reporting unit’s assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016  resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

units exceeded their respective carrying values as a result we concluded that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary 

  

fair value of derivative instruments 

  

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2016  the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was 179 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 325 million and 97 million respectively as of october 31 2016  

  

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

  

for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 10 “fair value” and note 11 “financial instruments” respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

loss contingencies 

  

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property “ip” commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 15 “litigation and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 15 “litigation and contingencies” are not a meaningful indicator of hp’s potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2016  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

financial condition and results of operations continued 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplementally present the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



  

net revenue 

  

in fiscal year 2016 total net revenue from continuing operations decreased 63 decreased 2 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal year 2015 net revenue from the united states increased 17 to 180 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 104 to 302 billion the primary factors contributing to the net revenue decline were unfavorable currency impacts weak market demand competitive pricing pressures and the change in the supplies sales model the net revenue decline was driven by decline in supplies commercial and consumer printers commercial and consumer desktops and consumer notebooks partially offset by growth in commercial notebooks 

in fiscal year 2015 total net revenue from continuing operations decreased 92 decreased 47 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal year 2014 net revenue from the united states decreased 26 to 177 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 122 to 337 billion the primary factors contributing to the net revenue decline were unfavorable currency impacts particularly in emea weak market demand and competitive pricing pressures the net revenue decline was driven by desktops and supplies partially offset by growth in notebooks and graphics products

our gross margin from continuing operations decreased to 193 for fiscal year 2015 compared with 198 for fiscal year 2014 the primary factors impacting gross margin performance were competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts partially offset by favorable component costs in personal systems favorable mix of ink and graphics supplies and operational cost improvements 

  

a more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “segment information” below 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development “rd” 

  

rd expense increased 2 in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to incremental investments in a3 and 3d printing partially offset by favorable currency impacts 

  

rd expense decreased 8 in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to favorable currency impacts 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  

sga expense decreased 19 in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to gains from the divestiture of certain software assets to open text corporation lower corporate governance and other overhead costs related to the preseparation combined entity our cost saving initiatives and favorable currency impacts these effects were partially offset by the gain from the divestiture of snapfish in the prioryear period 

  

sga expense decreased 12 in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to favorable currency impacts and declines in gotomarket costs as a result of lower commissions and productivity initiatives 

  

amortization of intangible assets 

  

amortization expense decreased by 86 million and 27 million in fiscal year 2016 and in fiscal year 2015 respectively primarily due to prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods 

restructuring and other charges 

  

restructuring and other charges increased by 142 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to severance pay and infrastructure related charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in september 2015 the “fiscal 2015 plan” 

on october 10 2016 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan the “fiscal 2017 plan” which will be implemented through fiscal year 2019 hp recognized 24 million of charges related to the fiscal 2017 plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 

restructuring and other charges decreased by 113 million in fiscal year 2015 primarily due to lower charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in may 2012 the “fiscal 2012 plan” hp recognized 39 million of charges related to the fiscal 2015 plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 

interest and other net 

  

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

interest and other net expense decreased by 600 million in fiscal year 2016 the decrease was primarily due to changes in indemnification receivables from hewlett packard enterprise for certain tax liabilities that hp is jointly and severally liable for but for which it is indemnified by hewlett packard enterprise under the tax matters agreement and lower foreign currency losses partially offset by lower interest income 

interest and other net expense decreased by 5 million in fiscal year 2015 the decrease was due to lower other miscellaneous expense 

  

provision for taxes 

  

our effective tax rates were 291 53 and 243 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore china malaysia and ireland we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore has not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings in addition to the above factors the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2016 were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

  

for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our provision for taxes see note 7 “taxes on earnings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

in fiscal 2016 we recorded 301 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year for continuing operations these amounts primarily include uncertain tax position charges of 525 million related to preseparation tax matters in addition we recorded 62 million of net tax benefits on restructuring and other charges 52 million of net tax benefits related to the release of foreign valuation allowances and 41 million of net tax benefits arising from the retroactive research and development credit provided by the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 signed into law in december 2015 and 70 million of other tax benefit 

in fiscal year 2015 we recorded 12 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year these amounts included 17 billion of tax benefits due to a release of valuation allowances pertaining to certain us deferred tax assets 449 million of tax charges related to uncertain tax positions on pension transfers 70 million of tax benefits related to state tax impacts and 6 million of income tax charges related to various other items in addition we recorded 33 million of income tax charges on restructuring and pensionrelated costs

the components of net revenue and the weighted net revenue change by business unit were as follows 





  

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015   

personal systems net revenue decreased 49 decreased 09 on a constant currency basis in fiscal year 2016 the net revenue decline in personal systems was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and weak market demand personal systems net revenue decreased as a result of a 35 decline in unit volume along with a 1 decline in average selling price “asp” as compared to the prioryear period the unit volume decline was primarily due to an overall decline in desktops and consumer notebooks partially offset by unit volume growth in commercial notebooks the decline in asp was primarily due to competitive pricing in the commercial segment partially offset by favorable pricing in the consumer segment and favorable mix shift in consumer highend premium products 

consumer and commercial revenue both decreased by 5 primarily due to weak market demand partially offset by an increase in commercial notebooks and pc services net revenue declined 2 in notebooks 9 in desktops 7 in workstations and 9 in other as compared to the prioryear period the net revenue decline in other was primarily due to lower sales in consumer tablets and personal systems options partially offset by revenue growth in pc services 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 06 percentage points in fiscal year 2016 the increase was primarily due to growth in gross margin driven by favorable commodity costs combined with product mix and increase in pc services the effects of which were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in revenue operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased by 01 percentage point primarily driven by an increase in field selling cost

printing net revenue decreased 140 decreased 93 on a constant currency basis for fiscal year 2016 the decline in net revenue was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts weakness in demand impact from the change in the supplies sales model and competitive pricing pressures these factors resulted in a net revenue decline across supplies and consumer and commercial hardware net revenue for supplies decreased 151 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts demand weakness combined with a competitive pricing environment and impact of the change in the supplies sales model printer unit volume decreased 12 and asp increased by 2 as compared to the prioryear period printer unit volume decreased due to weakness in demand our pricing discipline and focus on placing positive npv units printer asp increased primarily due to a favorable mix shift to highvalue printers partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts 

  

net revenue for commercial hardware decreased 6 for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prioryear period primarily driven by a 6 decline in unit volume and a decrease in other peripheral printing solutions the unit volume in commercial hardware declined primarily due to a unit volume decline in laserjet printers the asp in commercial hardware increased slightly primarily due to mix shift to highvalue printer sales offset by unfavorable currency impacts printer unit volume in consumer hardware declined 15 combined with a decline in other printing solutions largely driven by the divestiture of snapfish in the prioryear period and a 9 decline in asp resulted in a 30 decline in consumer hardware net revenue for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the unit volume decline in consumer hardware was primarily due to weakness in demand our pricing discipline and our continued efforts to place positive npv units the asp in consumer hardware decreased primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts

liquidity and capital resources   

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures restructuring activities maturing debt income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions however our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with majority of those amounts held outside of the united states we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

in september 2016 hp entered into a definitive agreement to acquire samsung electronics co ltd’s printer business for 105 billion the transaction is expected to close within 12 months pending regulatory review and other customary closing conditions 

amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law some would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external

our historical statements of cash flows represent the combined cash flows and key cash flow metrics of hp prior to the separation and have not been revised to reflect the effect of the separation for further information on discontinued operations see note 2 “discontinued operations” in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by  33 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 since the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 included the impact of discontinued operations which is not included in the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the separation 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 58 billion  for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 the decrease was due primarily to lower cash generated from working capital management activities payments for separation costs lower cash receipts from contract manufacturers and financing receivables lower net earnings in the current period unfavorable currency impacts as well as higher cash payments for prepaid expenses and employee benefits 

working capital metrics 

management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level the table below presents the cash conversion cycle as of october 31 2016 and october 31 2015 



  

hp inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable “dso” and days of supply in inventory “dos” less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable “dpo” items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal year 2016 the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to favorable revenue linearity and strong collections partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts for fiscal year 2015 the increase in dso compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to lower usage of cash discounts by our customers 

  

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2016 the dos was flat compared to fiscal year 2015 due to strong inventory management offset by higher inventory balance to support future sales levels for fiscal year 2015 the increase in dos compared to fiscal year 2014 was due to higher inventory balance to support future sales levels 

  

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal year 2016 the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily the result of extension of payment terms with our product suppliers and increased strategic inventory purchases for fiscal year 2015 the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily the result of purchasing linearity and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 56 billion  for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to capital expenditures and payments made in connection with business acquisitions net of cash acquired in fiscal year 2015 by the discontinued operations 

net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 27 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of aruba networks inc which was transferred to hewlett packard enterprise as a part of the separation 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities increased by 158 billion  in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the cash transfer of  104  billion to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation the redemption of  21  billion of us dollar global notes and cash utilization of  20  billion for repurchases of common stock and dividends 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 79 billion  for fiscal year 2015 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 66 billion in fiscal year 2014 the change was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in october 2015 by hewlett packard enterprise in principal amount of 146 billion and higher proceeds from issuance of commercial paper partially offset by the redemption of 66 billion of us dollar global notes and higher repayment of commercial paper as compared to fiscal year 2014

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

  

shortterm debt decreased by  21  billion and longterm debt increased by  01 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to redemption of  21  billion of fixed rate us dollar global notes in november 2015 

  

shortterm debt decreased by 04 billion and longterm debt decreased by 89 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to the redemption of 66 billion of us dollar global notes in connection with the separation and maturities of 25 billion of us dollar global notes in fiscal year 2015 during the month of november 2015 we paid 21 billion for the redemption of us dollar global notes as part of the final settlement of the debt redeemed as a part of the separation 

our debttoequity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders’ equity our debttoequity ratio decreased by 208x in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to negative equity resulting from the transfer of net assets of 325 billion to hewlett packard enterprise and redemption of 21 billion of fixedrate us dollar global notes due to the separation during fiscal year 2016 we generated operating cash flow of 32 billion our debttoequity ratio decreased by 035x in fiscal year 2015 due to a decrease in total debt balances of 93 billion coupled with an increase in total stockholders’ equity by 10 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 

  

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 11 “financial instruments” in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as of october 31 2016 we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of  40  billion which will be available until april 2 2019 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes 

available borrowing resources 

  

as of october 31 2016 we had available borrowing resources of 822 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to our 40 billion senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility discussed above for more information on our borrowings see note 12 “borrowings” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

credit ratings 

  

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of any such downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we can access alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 44 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2016  were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the british pound and the indian rupee for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2016  and 2015  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2016  and 2015  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 41 million and 54 million for continuing operations at october 31 2016  and october 31 2015  respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2016  and 2015  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2016  and 2015  the sensitivity analyses for continuing operations indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 51 million at october 31 2016  and 67 million at october 31 2015

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems and movement to continuous ink supply systems a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in central and eastern europe and russia and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given our large and diverse portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support and security if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or 

specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products services and solutions to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate 

global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of sales 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on 

changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers each of which is described below 

• component shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products we represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays • excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of 23 

favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • singlesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on canon for laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges we also rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs and workstations and we rely on amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 24 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

sales outside the united states made up approximately 64 of our net revenue for fiscal 2015 in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors • local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and oems • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

• managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations • we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers other thirdparties or market trends • certain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by hewlettpackard company resulted and in the future any such transactions by us may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans • any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable • our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representatives • the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated • in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders • we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition • our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate • an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter • business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operations 27 

• if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

• successfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus • persuading customers and distributors not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns 28 

• persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with thirdparties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we announced a restructuring plan in september 2015 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plan including details regarding the plan announced in september 2015 see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties  

some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by thirdparties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these thirdparties at all or on reasonable terms or such thirdparties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property for example some of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete 

defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition thirdparties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

thirdparties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp inc and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

further our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving our company in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from hp inc levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

the allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise company hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp incs trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp inc in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hp inc will no longer have ownership of intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly 

the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced business from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances • the pricing and other terms of some of our service agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services business • some of our service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements may involve the development and deployment of new technologies varying degrees of performance risk exist in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our services business 31 

• if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

hewlettpackard companys stock price has historically fluctuated and our stock price may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hp incs stock difficult to predict 

our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions future stock price performance board of directors executive team our competitors or our industry in general • the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flows changes in estimates by the investment community or our financial outlook and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by our competitors and other companies in the it industry 32 

• developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and • the timing and amount of our share repurchases general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies fitch ratings moodys investor service and standard  poors rating services downgraded hewlettpackard companys ratings in the past past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of 

new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data 

about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed 

retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp inc deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers • specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and • controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp inc could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock 

risks related to the separation 

the separation of hewlettpackard company into two independent publiclytraded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

on november 1 2015 we completed the separation of our enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses from its personal systems and printing businesses the process of completing the separation has involved significant costs and expenses uncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational marketing or other benefits from the separation as an independent publiclytraded company we are a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that for us federal income tax purposes the separation qualified for both the company and our stockholders as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368d1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgement but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax expenses resulting from the separation in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separation which may be material if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor hewlett packard enterprise could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

hewlett packard enterprise or hp inc may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements including among others a transition services agreement a separation and distribution agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement a commercial agreement and an it service agreement the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hewlett packard enterprise and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use incorporation and bundling in oem products and services resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of hewlett packard enterprises subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for us we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hewlett packard enterprise is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

hp inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the process of completing the separation was highly complex and involved significant costs and expenses accordingly we incurred separation costs and foreign tax expenses associated with separating into two companies in fiscal 2015 we recorded nonrecurring separation costs and net foreign tax expenses of 16 billion which were primarily related to thirdparty consulting contractor fees and other incremental costs directly associated with the separation process we expect total separation charges and net foreign tax expenses to be approximately 180 million in fiscal 2016 additionally the separation into two independent companies is expected to result in total dissynergies of approximately 400 million to 450 million annually which costs are primarily associated with corporate functions such as finance legal it real estate and human resources such dissynergies are expected to be divided approximately equally between hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise 

we recorded a deferred tax asset on these costs and expenses as they were incurred through fiscal 2015 we expect a portion of these deferred tax assets associated with separation costs and expenses will be eliminated given that some will be nondeductible at the time the separation is executed furthermore we concluded on the legal form of the separation and in may 2015 announced that hewlett packard enterprise will be the spinnee company in the united states us accordingly we implemented certain internal reorganizations of and transactions among our whollyowned subsidiaries and operating activities in preparation for the legal form of separation as a result we recognized gross incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal entities of approximately 300 million and foreign tax credits of approximately 100 million in fiscal 2015 with additional tax credit amounts expected over several years as of october 31 2015 we also expect separationrelated capital expenditures of approximately 30 million in fiscal 2016 

in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties going forward including among others a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a transition service agreement a real estate matters agreement a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we transferred substantially all of the assets liabilities and operations of enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses to hewlett packard enterprise in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015

hp consolidated net revenue declined 73 decreased 21 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the leading contributors to the net revenue decline were unfavorable currency impacts across all major segments key account runoff and soft demand in infrastructure technology outsourcing ito in es lower desktop sales in personal systems and lower sales of printers and supplies partially offsetting these declines was growth within the eg segment from sales of iss servers gross margin was 240 248 billion and 239 266 billion for fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the 01 percentage point increase in gross margin was due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in underperforming contracts in es partially offsetting the gross margin increase was the impact from a higher mix of iss products in eg competitive pricing pressures in printing and the impact from the sale of intellectual property ip in the prioryear period we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio hps operating margin decreased by 11 percentage points in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to separation costs pension plan settlement charges data center impairments and the impact from the sale of ip in the prioryear period partially offsetting these

declines was the gross margin increase lower selling general and administrative sga expenses and lower restructuring charges

we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market certain of our legacy hardware businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

the macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below 

• in personal systems we are witnessing soft demand in the personal computer pc market as customers hold onto their pcs longer thereby extending pc refresh cycles demand for pcs is being impacted by weaker macroeconomic conditions and currency devaluations in certain asian and european markets additionally industry wide pc channels in some regions are working through excess channel inventory which is impacting sell in as such we see continued market headwinds for the next several quarters however we are optimistic and see opportunity in the market long term given our strength in commercial and the launch of windows 10 combined with intels skylake processor family transition which may represent a catalyst for demand through introduction of breakthrough form factors in personal systems we are maintaining our strategic focus on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multioperating systems multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes additionally hp is investing significantly in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks detachable notebooks and commercial tablets in order to meet customer preference for mobile thinner and lighter devices • in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets we are also experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment due to aggressive pricing from our japanese competitors given the weakness of the japanese yen to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers in the consumer market our ink in the office products are driving unit volume due to our officejet pro product lines the ink in the office 46 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

initiative also targets shifting ink into smbs through our officejet pro x printers which leverage our pagewide array technology in the commercial market our focus is on placing higher value printer units which also offers a positive annuity of toner and ink and accelerating growth in graphics we are accomplishing this in several growth areas in multifunction and enterprise ink printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand in managed print services which presents a strong aftermarket supplies opportunity and in graphics with product innovation such as our indigo product line we plan to continue this focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to more valueadded units and expanding our innovative ink laser and graphics programs 

• in eg we are experiencing challenges due to multiple market trends including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment in addition demand for our business critical systems bcs products continues to weaken as has the overall market for unix products the effect of lower bcs and traditional storage revenue along with a higher mix of iss density optimized server products and midrange converged storage solutions is impacting support attach opportunities in technology services ts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and gotomarket execution challenges while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking storage blade servers and wireless networking • in es we are facing challenges including managing the revenue runoff from several large contracts pressured public sector spending a competitive pricing environment and market pressures from a mixed economic recovery in europe the middle east and africa emea we are also experiencing commoditization in the it infrastructure services market that is placing pressure on traditional ito pricing and cost structures there is also an industrywide shift to highly automated assetlight delivery of it infrastructure and applications leading to headcount consolidation to be successful in addressing these challenges we must execute on the es multiyear turnaround plan which includes a cost reduction initiative to align our costs to our revenue trajectory a focus on new logo wins and strategic enterprise services ses and initiatives to improve execution in sales performance and accountability contracting practices and pricing • in software we are facing challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges to be successful in addressing these challenges we must improve our gotomarket execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer needs and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud big data and security to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale 

for the various software products we sell eg big data analytics and applications application delivery management enterprise security and it operations management we assess whether the software products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable 

we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract customer support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided

on a whenandifavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered 

for hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in hosting arrangements we consider the rights provided to the customer eg whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software in determining whether the arrangement includes the sale of a software license in hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event we recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unitpriced contracts revenue for fixedprice outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straightline basis if the service is provided evenly over the contract term provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are recorded as a component of cost of sales 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 25 and 27 of annual net product revenue respectively

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as result of interim remeasurement 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the

expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2015 



taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2026 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 105 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to the consolidated statement of earnings in the period it is abandoned the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units goodwill is tested for impairment at the 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

reporting unit level as of october 31 2015 our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 2 except for es which includes two reporting units mphasis limited and the remainder of es 

in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 19 to approximately 2600 of carrying amounts the software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 19 

hp inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 7 to approximately 2400 of the carrying amounts with the software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 7 the fair value of the software reporting unit is estimated using equal weighting of both the income and market approaches our software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges if we are not successful in addressing these challenges our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the software reporting unit the fair value of the software reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publiclytraded companies changes in managements business strategy or significant and sustained declines in our stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2015 the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was 526 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 11 billion and 05 billion respectively as of october 31 2015 

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased

observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 11 and note 12 respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference are not a meaningful indicator of hps potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2015 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

interest and other net expense increased by 7 million in fiscal 2014 the increase was due primarily to higher currency transaction losses partially offset by lower interest expense from a lower average debt balance 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 38 235 and 215 in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on hps effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore china malaysia ireland and netherlands hp plans to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the us and therefore has not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings

segment information 

a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed 

effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2015 we implemented an organizational change to align our segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure this organizational change resulted in the transfer of thirdparty multivendor support arrangements from the ts business unit within the eg segment to the ito business unit within the es segment we have reflected this change to our segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented which has resulted in the removal of intersegment revenue from the ts business unit within the eg segment and the related corporate intersegment revenue eliminations and the transfer of operating profit from the ts business unit within the eg segment to the ito business unit within the es segment 

in connection with the separation effective at the beginning of its fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we implemented an organizational change which resulted in the transfer of marketing optimization solutions business from the software segment to the commercial hardware business unit within the

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 58 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease was due primarily to lower cash generated from working capital management activities payments for separation costs lower cash receipts from contract manufacturers and financing receivables lower net earnings in the current period unfavorable currency impacts as well as higher cash payments for prepaids and employee benefits net cash provided by operating activities increased by 07 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to improvements in working capital management

days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2015 the increase in dso was due primarily to lower usage of cash discounts by our customers and longer standard payment terms for aruba for fiscal 2014 the decrease in dso was due primarily to the impact of currency and the expansion of our factoring programs 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2015 the increase in dos was due to higher inventory balance to support future sales levels for fiscal 2014 the increase in dos was due to a higher inventory balance in personal systems due in part to strategic and advanced buys 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2015 the increase in dpo was primarily the result of purchasing linearity and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers for fiscal 2014 the increase in dpo was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of any such downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we can rely on alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

18 million to its nonus pension plans approximately 36 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants and approximately 43 million to cover benefit claims for hps postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions and payments to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

6 restructuring plans as of october 31 2015 hp including hewlett packard enterprise expects future cash payments of approximately 32 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes 13 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with the remaining approximately 19 billion cash payments to be made through fiscal 2025 subsequent to the separation hp inc expects future cash payments of approximately 280 million in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes 90 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with the remaining approximately 190 million cash payments to be made through fiscal 2025 payments for restructuring have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments for more information on our restructuring activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 7 separation costs as of october 31 2015 hp including hewlett packard enterprise expects future cash payments of approximately 750 million in connection with our separation charges and net foreign tax payments which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with subsequent tax credit amounts expected over later years as of october 31 2015 we also expect separationrelated capital expenditures of approximately 60 million in fiscal 2016 subsequent to the separation hp inc expects future cash payments of approximately 180 million in connection with our separation charges and net foreign tax payments which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with subsequent tax credit amounts expected over later years as of october 31 2015 hp inc also expects separationrelated capital expenditures of approximately 30 million in fiscal 2016 payments for separation costs have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments 8 uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2015 we had approximately 37 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 15 million expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities for more information on our uncertain tax positions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we have thirdparty shortterm financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers the total aggregate maximum capacity of the financing arrangements was 33 billion as of october 31 2015 including an aggregate maximum capacity of 14 billion in nonrecourse financing arrangements and an aggregate maximum capacity of 19 billion in partialrecourse facilities for more information on our thirdparty revolving shortterm financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 79 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2015 were the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2015 and 2014 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 72 million and 62 million at october 31 2015 and october 31 2014 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense 

the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2015 and 2014 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 119 million at october 31 2015 and 80 million at october 31 2014

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution • independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products • systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and • advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager generally from eg or es to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers pps typically manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 65 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2014 came from outside the united states us 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 34 billion in fiscal 2014 31 billion in fiscal 2013 and 34 billion in fiscal 2012 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2014 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 34000 patents which represents a decrease over the number of patents in our portfolio at the end of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 this decrease is attributable in part to the sale of a portfolio of mobile computing intellectual property ip in january 2014 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license ip from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the ip rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their ip rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services enterprise it infrastructure products and solutions multivendor customer services and it management software and solutions we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems the market shift towards tablets within mobility the market shift to cloudrelated infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice business models another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are going after new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model and gotomarket execution in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the united states central eastern europe and russia and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our large portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

in may 2012 we announced a companywide restructuring plan the restructuring plan includes both voluntary early retirement programs and nonvoluntary workforce reductions significant risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees in addition our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support 

security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across all of those businesses while competing with companies that have much smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition for our products and services and as a result we may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products in addition the performance of our business critical systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for unix servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our itaniumbased products revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a changing and hybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute 

on this strategy we need to continue evolving our focus towards the delivery of integrated it solutions for our customers and to continue to invest and expand into cloud computing security big data and mobility any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial results 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions in addition after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or the employees of those contractors or subcontractors in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

our plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline or at all and will involve significant time and expense which could disrupt or adversely affect our business 

on october 6 2014 we announced plans to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies the separation which is currently targeted to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 is subject to approval by our board of directors of the final terms of the separation and market regulatory and certain other conditions unanticipated developments including changes in the competitive conditions of hewlettpackard enterprises and hp incs respective markets possible delays in obtaining various tax opinions or rulings regulatory approvals or clearances the uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in executing the separation could delay or prevent the 

completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected 

we have established a separation management office tasked with driving the separation process we expect that the process of completing the proposed separation will be timeconsuming and involve significant costs and expenses which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a discernible benefit if the separation is not completed executing the proposed separation will require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees which could adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion which could harm our businesses 

the separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational marketing or other benefits from the separation as independent publiclytraded companies hewlettpackard enterprise and hp inc will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect their respective business financial condition and results of operations further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

the proposed separation may result in disruptions to and negatively impact our relationships with our customers and other business partners 

uncertainty related to the proposed separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects the effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

we intend to obtain an opinion of outside counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the separation will qualify for both hp and its stockholders as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368a1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we intend to obtain a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs andor one or more opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for hp and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and any irs private letter ruling will be based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel or the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions andor irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in addition we may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax expense resulting from separations in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material 

economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa emea region china and other highgrowth markets the us federal government spending cuts that went into effect on march 1 2013 may further reduce demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses particularly our services businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and 

maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margins and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety 

of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm us in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or services offerings which could result in further costs and delays • oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin • contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectibility risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 24 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate any supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations and servers and amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and cash flows business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition six of our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general 

infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 65 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific hp suppliers and oms • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment 26 

• differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa for example as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the german public prosecutors office has been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of hp engaged in bribery embezzlement and tax evasion in addition the polish central anticorruption bureau is conducting investigations into potential fcpa violations by a former employee of an hp subsidiary in connection with certain publicsector transactions in poland although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

• managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations • we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers or other thirdparties • business combination and investment transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans • any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable • our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representatives • our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies • the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated • in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders • we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition • our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate 28 

• an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter • business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation • if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example in our third fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our former services segment and a 12 billion impairment charge as a result of an asset impairment analysis of the compaq trade name acquired in 2002 in addition in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with autonomy if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

integration issues are often complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns • persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with thirdparties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions while we do not currently plan to divest any of our major businesses we do regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic 

objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by thirdparties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these thirdparties at all or on reasonable terms or such thirdparties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition thirdparties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp and its customers the number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future if we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly 

the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances • the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our it services business • some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business 31 

• some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable thirdparty the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the cash flows of our it services business • if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our profitably could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or 32 

investment transactions future stock price performance board of directors executive team our competitors or our industry in general 

• the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by hp or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flows changes in estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry • developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies two of those rating agencies moodys investors service and standard  poors ratings services downgraded our ratings once during fiscal 2012 and a third rating agency fitch ratings downgraded our ratings twice during that fiscal year in addition moodys investors service downgraded our ratings again in november 2012 our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performancebased restricted units some of which contain conditions relating to hps stock price performance and hps longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting sharebased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and 

deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

unforeseen environmental costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non compliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers • specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and • controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp stock

the following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2014 



1 hp consolidated net revenue excludes intersegment net revenue and other segment earnings from operations exclude corporate and unallocated costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated charges 2 nm represents not meaningful 

hp net revenue declined 08 decreased 04 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the leading contributors to the hp net revenue decline were key account runoff in es and lower printing supplies volume partially offsetting the net revenue decline was growth in personal systems from commercial personal computers pcs which experienced growth across all product categories along with growth in consumer notebooks hps gross margin increased by 08 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in underperforming contracts in es and favorable currency impacts from the japanese yen and continued cost structure improvements in printing we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio hps operating margin was flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the gross margin increase improved business performance primarily in printing es and personal systems and lower intangible asset amortization offset by higher restructuring charges investments in research and development rd and higher selling general and administrative sga expenses the increase in sga expenses was partially offset by gains from sales of real estate 

our business continues to produce significant cash flow from operations generating 123 billion in fiscal 2014 additionally we invested 30 billion in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales repurchased 27 billion of common stock and paid dividends of 12 billion to stockholders as of october 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments were 155 billion representing an increase of approximately 30 billion from october 31 2013 

we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to continuing dynamic and accelerating market trends another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and

solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution the macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below 

• in personal systems we have been negatively impacted by the market shift towards tablet products within mobility products which has reduced the demand for pcs particularly consumer notebooks if benefits from our new product investments in this area do not materialize we will continue to be negatively impacted by this trend however the pace of the market decline is slowing with signs of stabilization and hp is gaining market share in personal systems we are maintaining our strategic focus on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to multios multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes in fiscal 2014 personal systems experienced revenue growth in commercial pcs with growth across all product categories particularly notebooks along with growth in consumer notebooks the increase in demand was due in part to customers migrating from the windows xp operating system benefits from the delayed installed base refresh cycle and new product introductions • in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets as well as an overall competitive pricing environment to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories developing emerging market opportunities and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers in fiscal 2014 printing experienced a revenue decline and an increase in operating profit as we continued our print strategies with a focus on driving high value printer unit placements in the consumer market our ink in the office products are driving unit volume due to demand for our officejet pro product lines particularly our officejet pro x printers which leverage our pagewide array technology the ink in the office initiative targets shifting ink into smbs more profitably in the commercial market our focus is on placing higher value printer units which also offer a positive annuity of toner we are accomplishing this in two growth areas in multifunction printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand and in managed print services which presents a strong aftermarket supplies opportunity we plan to continue this focus on replenishing the installed base with valueadded units and expanding our innovative ink and laser programs • in eg we are experiencing revenue challenges due to multiple market trends including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment in addition demand for our business critical systems bcs products continues to weaken along with the overall market for unix products and the effect of lower bcs revenue is impacting technology services ts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and gotomarket execution challenges and continue to pursue new product innovation in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking storage blade servers and wireless networking in fiscal 2014 eg experienced a decline in revenue and operating profit due to the previously mentioned challenging market environment in particular weak market demand in bcs and market shifts impacting storage elsewhere in eg we experienced areas of 45

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured as well as other revenue recognition principles including industry specific revenue recognition guidance 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale 

for the various software products we sell eg operating system software network enabling software it and management software and enterprise security software we assess whether the software products were sold standalone or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable 

we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on an ifandwhenavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered 

for hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied in hosting arrangements that include software licenses we consider the rights provided to the customer eg ownership of a license contract termination provisions and feasibility of the customer to operate the software in determining when to recognize revenue for the licenses 

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event we recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unitpriced contracts revenue for fixedprice outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straightline basis if the service is provided evenly over the contract term provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are recorded as a component of cost of sales 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 27 and 29 of annual net product revenue respectively 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan as a result of a historical study of the us plans in fiscal 2014 hp adopted a new mortality rate table which incorporated newly released mortality rates published by the society of actuaries this resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately 870 million for the us defined benefit plans the 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2014 



taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 105 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we changed our reporting units in connection with continued operational synergies and interdependencies between the enterprise servers storage and networking reporting unit and the ts reporting unit within the eg segment we combined these reporting units to create the eg reporting unit as of october 31 2014 our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in note 2 except for es which includes two reporting units mphasis limited and the remainder of es 

in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 18 to approximately 12000 of carrying amounts the software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 18 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 6 to approximately 10000 of the carrying amounts with the software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 6 the fair value of the software reporting unit is estimated using a weighting of both the income and market approaches our software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges if we are not successful in addressing these challenges our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the software reporting unit the fair value of the software reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publiclytraded companies changes in managements business strategy or significant declines in our stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2014 the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was 547 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 980 million and 405 million respectively as of october 31 2014 

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference are not a meaningful indicator of hps potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2014 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2014 total hp net revenue declined 08 decreased 04 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal 2013 us net revenue decreased 37 to 388 billion while net revenue from outside of the us increased 09 to 726 billion the leading contributors to the hp net revenue decline were key account runoff in es and lower printing supplies volume partially offsetting the net revenue decline was growth in personal systems from commercial pcs which experienced growth across all product categories along with growth in consumer notebooks 

from a segment perspective the primary factors contributing to the change in hp net revenue for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 are summarized as follows 

• es net revenue declined due primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts weak growth in new and existing accounts particularly in emea and contractual price declines • printing net revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in supplies • eg net revenue decreased due to net revenue declines in ts bcs and storage • software net revenue decreased due to lower net revenue from licenses support and professional services • hpfs net revenue decreased due primarily to lower portfolio revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset management activity primarily in customer buyouts • corporate investments net revenue increased due to the sale of intellectual property ip and • personal systems net revenue increased due to growth in commercial pcs particularly notebooks along with growth in consumer notebooks fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 total hp net revenue declined 67 decreased 55 on a constant currency basis as compared with fiscal 2012 us net revenue decreased 44 to 403 billion while net revenue from outside of the us decreased 79 to 720 billion the net revenue decline was due primarily to declines of approximately 10 7 5 and 3 in our personal systems es eg and printing segments respectively 

from a segment perspective the primary factors contributing to the change in hp net revenue for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 are summarized as follows 

• personal systems net revenue declined due to the decline in the overall pc market as a result of a customer shift particularly consumers to tablet products • es net revenue declined due primarily to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts due in part to weak public sector spending and enterprise it demand • eg net revenue declined due to multiple factors including competitive pricing challenges in iss a market decline for unix products impacting bcs declines in ts due in part to lower support for bcs products product transitions in storage and overall weak enterprise it demand • printing net revenue declined due to unfavorable currency impacts particularly the euro and declines in supplies and commercial printers 56

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

• hpfs net revenue decreased due primarily to lower rental revenue from a decrease in operating lease assets and • software net revenue declined due to lower license and professional services revenues from itcloud management and information management products a more detailed discussion of segment revenue is included under segment information below 

gross margin 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

hps gross margin increased by 08 percentage points for fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 from a segment perspective the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows 

• es gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies improving profit performance in underperforming contracts and labor savings as a result of restructuring • printing gross margin increased due primarily to favorable currency impacts from the japanese yen continued cost structure improvements and a favorable mix from a higher proportion of graphics and ink supplies • corporate investments gross margin increased due to the sale of ip • software gross margin increased due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in professional services • hpfs gross margin increased due to a higher portfolio margin primarily from lower bad debt expense a lower cost of funds and improved margins in remarketing sales • personal systems gross margin increased due primarily to operational cost improvements a favorable mix of commercial products and the sale of ip and • eg gross margin decreased due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of iss products lower mix of bcs products and competitive pricing pressure in iss and networking fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

hps gross margin decreased by 02 percentage points for fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 from a segment perspective the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows 

• eg experienced a gross margin decline due primarily to competitive pricing pressures in iss and to a lesser extent mix impacts from lower bcs and storage revenue • personal systems experienced a gross margin decline due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing pressures • es gross margin decreased due to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines • software gross margin decreased slightly due to higher development costs in itcloud management products 57 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

• hpfs gross margin increased slightly due primarily to higher portfolio margins from a lower mix of operating leases and higher margins on early buyouts and • printing gross margin increased due primarily to improvement in toner gross margins as a result of lower discounting and higher average revenue per unit aru in consumer printers a more detailed discussion of segment gross margins and operating margins is included under segment information below 

operating expenses 

research and development 

rd expense increased 10 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 with increases across each of our segments as we make investments in our strategic focus areas of cloud security big data and mobility 

rd expense decreased 8 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to the rationalization of rd in eg for bcs cost savings from restructuring and higher value added rd tax subsidy credits the decrease was partially offset by increased rd expense in our storage and iss business units and in software for innovationfocused spending in the areas of converged infrastructure and cloud 

selling general and administrative 

sga expense increased 1 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher compensation costs litigation expenses and higher selling costs from investments in the areas of cloud networking and storage partially offset by gains from sales of real estate and lower program spending in marketing 

sga expense decreased 2 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts that impacted all of our segments partially offsetting the decline were higher marketing expenses to support new product introductions and increased administrative expenses due in part to higher consulting project spending 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2014 due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods 

amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the intangible asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 related to autonomy and certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods 

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 80 billion and 57 billion associated with es and the acquisition of autonomy respectively in addition we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of 31 billion and 12 billion associated with the acquisition of autonomy and the compaq trade name respectively for more information on our impairment charges see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges increased in fiscal 2014 due primarily to higher charges in connection with the multiyear restructuring plan initially announced in may 2012 the 2012 plan and from increases to the 2012 plan announced in fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2014 hp increased the total for positions expected to be eliminated under the 2012 plan from 34000 to 55000 positions with these changes hp expects to recognize additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2015 

restructuring charges decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the 21 billion charge recorded in fiscal 2012 for the 2012 plan restructuring charges for fiscal 2013 were approximately 10 billion which included 12 billion of charges related to the 2012 plan that were partially offset by a reversal of 190 million of severance charges related to our fiscal 2010 es restructuring plan 

interest and other net 

interest and other net expense increased by 7 million in fiscal 2014 the increase was due primarily to higher currency transaction losses partially offset by lower interest expense from a lower average debt balance 

interest and other net expense decreased by 255 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven primarily by lower currency transaction losses coupled with lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and lower investment losses 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 235 215 and 60 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore netherlands china and ireland we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the us and therefore have not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings 

in addition to the above factors the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was impacted by nondeductible goodwill impairments and increases in valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets 

for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our provision for taxes see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

segment information 

a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed 

effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we implemented certain organizational changes to align the segment financial reporting more closely with our current business structure these organizational changes include 

• transferring the hp exstream business from the commercial hardware business unit within the printing segment to the software segment 59

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

• transferring the personal systems trade and warranty support business from the ts business unit within the eg segment to the other business unit within the personal systems segment • transferring the spare and replacement parts supporting the personal systems and printing segments from the ts business unit within the eg segment to the other business unit within the personal systems segment and the commercial hardware business unit within the printing segment respectively and • transferring certain cloudrelated incubation activities previously reported in corporate and unallocated costs and eliminations and in the eg segment to the corporate investments segment in addition we transferred certain intrasegment eliminations from the es segment and the eg segment to corporate intersegment revenue eliminations 

hp has reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented which has resulted in the transfer of revenue among the printing personal systems eg es and software segments and the transfer of operating profit among the printing personal systems eg software and corporate investments segments these changes had no impact on the previously reported financial results for the hpfs segment in addition none of these changes impacted hps previously reported consolidated net revenue earnings from operations net earnings net eps or consolidated assets

personal systems net revenue increased 66 increased 72 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 while the personal systems business continues to be challenged by the market shift towards mobility products the pace of the pc market decline is slowing with signs of stabilization driven by growth in commercial pcs the effects of which were partially offset by weakness in consumer pcs the revenue increase in personal systems was due to growth in commercial pcs particularly notebooks along with growth in consumer notebooks personal systems experienced revenue growth across all regions led by double digit revenue growth in emea which experienced improved demand the revenue increase was driven by an 82 increase in unit volume the effects of which were partially offset by a 15 decline in average selling prices asps the unit volume increase was primarily led by growth in commercial notebooks as well as strength in commercial desktops consumer notebooks and thin client products the decline in asps was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts the effects of which were partially offset by a favorable mix of commercial pcs net revenue for commercial clients increased 102 due primarily to the benefits from the delayed installed base refresh cycle the effects of customers migrating from the windows xp operating system and growth in all product categories partly driven by new product introductions including the hp elite products net revenue for consumer clients remained flat as growth in consumer notebooks partly driven by our new product lineup including chromebooks and hybrid products was offset by a decline in consumer desktops for fiscal 2014 net revenue for notebook pcs increased 9 desktop pcs increased 3 workstations increased 3 and other net revenue increased 16 the net revenue increase in other was due to the sale of ip and growth in mobility products primarily consumer tablets which were introduced in the second half of fiscal 2013 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 07 percentage points for fiscal 2014 the increase was driven by an increase in gross margin and a decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in gross margin was due primarily to operational cost improvements a favorable commercial mix and the sale of ip the effects of which were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due primarily to our cost structure optimization efforts the effects of which were partially offset by increased research and development investments for commercial mobility and immersive computing products as well as higher administrative expenses driven by lower bad debt recoveries as compared to fiscal 2013 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

personal systems net revenue decreased 102 decreased 90 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 the personal systems business continued to experience significant challenges due to the overall pc market decline as a result of a customer shift particularly consumers to tablet products the business also experienced broadbased regional demand weakness particularly in the emea region the decline in personal systems revenue was driven by an 8 decline in unit volume along with a 3 decline in asps the unit volume decrease was led by declines in consumer and notebook products as a result of the market shift to tablet products the decline in asps was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment net revenue for consumer clients decreased 19 while net revenue for commercial clients decreased 4 notebook pcs net revenue decreased 15 while desktop pcs net revenue decreased 8 workstations net revenue growth was flat while other net revenue increased 19 the net revenue increase in other was related to increased sales of extended warranties and thirdparty branded options and sales of consumer tablets

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 18 percentage points in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven by a decline in gross margin combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the decline in gross margin was due to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing pressures these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower component and warranty costs and a favorable mix of highermargin commercial products operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due primarily to the size of the revenue decline as well as slightly higher rd costs however operating expenses declined across most other expense categories as a result of benefits from our ongoing restructuring efforts 

printing 



the components of the weighted net revenue change by business unit were as follows 



fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2014 printing experienced a decline in revenue and an increase in operating profit as we continued to push our print strategies which includes driving high value printer unit placements and expanding our graphics products and managed print services portfolio printing net revenue decreased 38 decreased 34 on a constant currency basis for fiscal 2014 the decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in supplies the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics products and managed print services net revenue for supplies decreased 5 driven by demand weakness in toner and ink and a reduction in channel inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics supplies printer unit volume remained flat while average revenue per unit aru decreased 1 printer unit volume was flat due primarily to our continued efforts to target high value areas of the market which resulted in a decline in home printer units and lowvalue laserjet printer units the effects of which were offset by increased units in smb multifunction laser and graphics printers the decline in aru was due primarily to increased discounting driven by competitive pricing pressures net revenue for commercial hardware was flat as a 3 increase in printer unit volume was offset by a 3 decline in printer aru the unit volume in commercial hardware increased due primarily to growth in our multifunction laser printers and graphics printers the aru decline in commercial hardware was due primarily to a decline in

laserjet and graphics printers driven by a competitive pricing environment net revenue for consumer hardware decreased 4 driven by a 1 decline in printer unit volume and a 1 decline in aru along with a decline in other peripheral printing solutions the unit volume decline in consumer hardware was due to lower sales of home printers the effects of which were partially offset by growth in smb printers the aru decline in consumer hardware was due primarily to increased discounting for smb printers due to a competitive pricing environment the effects of which were partially offset by a favorable mix of high value home printers 

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 17 percentage points for fiscal 2014 as an increase in gross margin more than offset an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the gross margin increase was due to favorable currency impacts primarily driven by the japanese yen continued cost structure improvements and a favorable mix from a higher proportion of graphics and ink supplies the effects of which were partially offset by a competitive pricing environment operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due primarily to higher rd expenses as a result of our investments in enterprise products and 3d printing the effects of which were partially offset by reduced marketing expenses 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

printing net revenue decreased 26 decreased 1 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven by unfavorable currency impacts particularly weakness in the euro and declines in supplies and commercial printers net revenue for supplies decreased 3 due to unfavorable currency impacts and lower volumes of toner and ink supplies these effects were partially offset by growth in large format printing supplies printer unit volumes declined by 3 while aru increased by 1 printer unit volumes decreased largely due to declines in lowend consumer printers as we continued our focus on highervalue ink in the office and ink advantage products the increase in aru was driven by a mix shift to highvalue consumer printers the effect of which was partially offset by higher discounting in commercial printers net revenue for commercial hardware decreased 3 which was driven by a 6 decline in aru that was partially offset by a volume increase of 2 the decline in commercial hardware net revenue was partially offset by net revenue growth in the graphics services and managed print services businesses net revenue for consumer hardware remained flat due to a 7 increase in aru the effect of which was offset by a 5 reduction in volume unit volume and aru increased within highvalue consumer printers as a result of our continued focus on those more profitable printers 

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 18 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in gross margin combined with lower operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the gross margin increase was due to improvement in toner gross margins resulting from lower discounting higher aru in consumer printers and lower cost of sales in toner and commercial printers due to a favorable currency impact from the japanese yen these positive effects were partially offset by an unfavorable mix of lowermargin consumer printers operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due to lower administrative rd and field selling costs as a result of benefits from our ongoing restructuring efforts these effects were partially offset by higher marketing expenses to support new product introductions

es net revenue decreased 69 decreased 68 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 performance in es remains challenged by the impact of several large contracts winding down and lower public sector spending in emea particularly in the united kingdom and several other countries in emea the net revenue decrease in es was due primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts weak growth in new and existing accounts particularly in emea and contractual price declines these effects were partially offset by net revenue growth in our ses portfolio which includes information management and analytics security and cloud services net revenue in infrastructure technology outsourcing ito decreased by 8 in fiscal 2014 due to revenue runoff in key accounts weak growth in new and existing accounts particularly in emea and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts partially offset by growth in cloud and security revenue and favorable currency impacts net revenue in application and business services abs decreased by 5 in fiscal 2014 due to revenue runoff in a key account weak growth in new and existing accounts particularly in emea and unfavorable currency impacts partially offset by growth in information management and analytics and cloud revenue 

es earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 08 percentage points in fiscal 2014 the increase in operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies improving profit performance in underperforming contracts and labor savings as a result of restructuring partially offset by unfavorable impacts from revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and existing accounts the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by the size of the revenue decline and higher administrative expenses and field selling costs the increase in current year administrative expenses was due to the prioryear period containing higher bad debt recoveries and insurance recoveries the increase in selling costs was the result of expanding the sales force coverage as we transition from a reactive sales model to a more proactive approach 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

es net revenue decreased 74 decreased 63 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 revenue performance in es continues to be challenged by several factors that impact the demand environment including weak public sector spending in the us and austerity measures in other countries particularly in the united kingdom and weak it services spend due to the mixed global recovery particularly in the emea region the net revenue decrease in es was driven primarily by net service revenue runoff contractual price declines in ongoing contracts and unfavorable currency impacts ito net revenue decreased by 6 in fiscal 2013 due to net service revenue runoff

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

software net revenue decreased 22 decreased 21 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 revenue growth in software is being challenged by the overall market and customer shift to saas solutions which is impacting growth in license and support revenue in fiscal 2014 net revenue from licenses support and professional services decreased by 3 2 and 5 respectively while saas net revenue increased by 5 

the decline in license net revenue was due to the market and customer shift to saas solutions which resulted in lower revenue from itcloud management and information management products partially offset by strength in some of our key focus areas of big data analytics and security the decrease in support net revenue was due to past declines in license revenue professional services net revenue decreased as we continue our focus on highermargin engagements these declines were partially offset by higher saas revenue due to improving demand for our saas solutions in itcloud management products and security products 

in fiscal 2014 software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 06 percentage points due to an increase in gross margin the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in gross margin was due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in professional services the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to investments in rd partially offset by lower sga expenses due to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts and improved operational expense management

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

software net revenue decreased 36 decreased 26 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 net revenue from licenses and professional services decreased by 16 and 13 respectively while net revenue from saas and support increased by 10 and 7 respectively 

the decline in software revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue from itcloud management and information management products due primarily to a large deal entered into in the prior year and the market shift to saas offerings the revenue decline was also due to lower professional services revenue from itcloud management and information management products as we manage the professional services portfolio to focus on highermargin solutions these declines were partially offset by higher growth in support revenue from our information management and security products and higher revenue growth in our saas offerings from itcloud management and information management products as we shift with the market to providing more saas offerings 

software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 16 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue the effect of which was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher development costs in itcloud management products and the comparative impact of a highly profitable software deal entered into in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by a lower mix of lowermargin professional services revenue the decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by lower field selling costs due to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts 

hp financial services 



fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

hpfs net revenue decreased by 36 decreased 33 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 due primarily to lower portfolio revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset management activity primarily in customer buyouts 

hpfs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 01 percentage points in fiscal 2014 the increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in gross margin was the result of a higher portfolio margin primarily from lower bad debt expense and a lower cost of funds and improved margins in remarketing sales the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher gotomarket investments 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

hpfs net revenue decreased by 50 decreased 42 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 due primarily to lower rental revenue from a decrease in average operating lease assets lower asset recovery services revenue and unfavorable currency impacts these effects were partially offset by higher revenue from remarketing sales and higher finance income from an increase in finance lease assets

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

hpfs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 08 percentage points in fiscal 2013 the increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue as a result of higher it investments the increase in gross margin was the result of higher portfolio margin from a lower mix of operating leases higher margin on early buyouts and lower bad debt expense 

financing originations 



new financing originations which represent the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services including intercompany activity increased 147 in fiscal 2014 and decreased 150 in fiscal 2013 respectively the increase in fiscal 2014 was driven by higher financing associated with hp product sales and related services offerings while the decrease in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by lower financing associated with hp product sales and services offerings and to a lesser extent unfavorable currency impacts 

portfolio assets and ratios 

the hpfs business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive hpfs amounts are substantially the same as those used by hp however intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for hpfs were as follows 



1 intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation 2 allowance for doubtful accounts for financing receivables includes both the short and longterm portions 3 debt attributable to hpfs consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes intercompany debt and borrowing and fundingrelated activity associated with hpfs and its subsidiaries debt attributable to hpfs totaled 107 billion and 108 billion at october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 respectively hpfs equity at both october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 was 15 billion we believe the hpfs debttoequity ratio is comparable to that of other similar financing companies 

at october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 hpfs cash balances were 829 million and 697 million respectively 

net portfolio assets at october 31 2014 decreased 13 from october 31 2013 the decrease generally resulted from unfavorable currency impacts partially offset by new financing volume in excess of portfolio runoff 

hpfs recorded net bad debt expenses and operating lease equipment reserves of 40 million 50 million and 62 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively

1 nm represents not meaningful 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the revenue increase for fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the sale of ip related to the palm acquisition 

the decrease in the loss from operations for fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the sale of ip the benefits of which were partially offset by higher expenses associated with cloudrelated incubation activities corporate strategy hp labs and global alliances 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 corporate investments net revenue was primarily related to licensing revenue from hp labs net revenue decreased from fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower residual activity from the webos device business and lower revenue from business intelligence products 

costs and expenses in corporate investments are due to activities in the segment from residual activity related to the webos device business hp labs certain incubation projects corporate strategy and global alliances 

liquidity and capital resources 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures restructuring activities maturing debt income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions however our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a which is incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the us we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the us most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us but under current law some would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the us and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents total debt and available borrowing resources were as follows 



1 in addition to these available borrowing resources we are able to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in may 2012 the 2012 shelf registration statement 

our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 07 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to improvements in working capital management net cash provided by operating activities increased by 10 billion for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to improvements in working capital management and a reduction in payments associated with webos contract cancellations 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our key working capital metrics were as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2014 the decrease in dso was due primarily to the impact of currency and the expansion of our factoring programs 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2014 the increase in dos was due to a higher inventory balance in personal systems due in part to strategic and advanced buys 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2014 the increase in dpo was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo the cash conversion cycle ended fiscal 2014 below what we expect to be a longterm sustainable rate items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a longterm sustainable rate include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher cash utilization for purchases of property plant and equipment offset by cash generated from sales of availableforsale securities net cash used in investing activities decreased by 07 billion for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower investments in property plant and equipment and higher net sales and maturities of availableforsale securities 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 14 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the decrease was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of us dollar global notes in january 2014 partially offset by higher debt repayments and repurchases of common stock net cash used in financing activities increased by 41 billion for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was due primarily to higher maturities of debt and net repayments of commercial paper for more information on our share repurchase programs see item 5 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference

capital resources 

debt levels 



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities our cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

shortterm debt and longterm debt decreased by 25 billion and 06 billion respectively for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the net decrease in total debt was due primarily to maturities of debt during fiscal 2014 we issued 20 billion of us dollar global notes under the 2012 shelf registration statement which mature in 2019 and repaid 49 billion of us dollar global notes we also issued 116 billion and repaid 115 billion of commercial paper in fiscal 2014 shortterm debt and longterm debt decreased by 06 billion and 52 billion respectively for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 both net decreases were due primarily to maturities of debt and net repayments of commercial paper the issuances and repayments of commercial paper were 161 billion and 162 billion in fiscal 2013 and 122 billion and 150 billion in fiscal 2012 respectively 

during fiscal 2015 25 billion of us dollar global notes are scheduled to mature of which 650 million matured in december 2014 for more information on our borrowings see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

our debttoequity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders equity our debttoequity ratio decreased by 010x in fiscal 2014 due to a decrease in total debt balances of 31 billion partially offset by a decrease in stockholders equity by 05 billion at the end of fiscal 2014 our debttoequity ratio decreased by 043x in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in total debt balances of 58 billion coupled with an increase in stockholders equity by 48 billion at the end of fiscal 2013

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based on publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them our credit ratings as of october 31 2014 were as follows 



after the announcement of our separation in october 2014 our credit ratings were assigned a negative outlook by standard  poors rating services and fitch rating services additionally moodys investors service placed us under review for downgrade in december 2013 moodys investors service affirmed its negative outlook assigned in november 2012 while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any of these rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we can rely on alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of debt or other securities under our existing 2012 shelf registration statement if necessary to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper

contractual and other obligations 

our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2014 were as follows 



1 amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments discounts or premiums 2 amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our us dollar global notes to variable interest rates the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31 2014 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 4 in fiscal 2015 hp anticipates making contributions of 686 million to its nonus pension plans expects to pay benefits of 35 million to its us nonqualified pension plan participants and expects to pay claims of 47 million under its postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions and payments to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 5 we expect future cash payments of 18 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes 10 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2015 with the remaining approximately 800 million cash payments to be made through fiscal 2021 payments for restructuring have been 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments for more information on our restructuring activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

6 as of october 31 2014 we had approximately 35 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 27 million expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities for more information on our uncertain tax positions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we have thirdparty revolving shortterm financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers the total aggregate maximum capacity of the financing arrangements was 30 billion as of october 31 2014 including an aggregate maximum capacity of 11 billion in nonrecourse financing arrangements and an aggregate maximum capacity of 19 billion in partialrecourse facilities for more information on our thirdparty revolving shortterm financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 75 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2014 were the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2014 and 2013 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2014 and 2013 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 62 million and 80 million at october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense 

the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2014 and 2013 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2014 and 2013 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 80 million at october 31 2014 and 95 million at october 31 2013

corporate investments 

corporate investments includes hp labs the webos business and certain business incubation projects 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution • independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products • systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and • advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services the mix of our business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses so while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager generally from eg or es to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers pps typically manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems manufacture products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order permits configuration of units to a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building 

products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also aim to acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 64 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2013 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe 

we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 31 billion in fiscal 2013 34 billion in fiscal 2012 and 33 billion in fiscal 2011 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2013 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 38000 patents which represented a slight increase over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if thirdparties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and 

services for example european sales often are weaker in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products some of our products also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we also are subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations and treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems the market shift towards tablets within mobility the market shift to cloudrelated infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice business models another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are going after new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model and gotomarket execution in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the united states western and northern europe and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our large portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

in may 2012 we announced a companywide restructuring plan expected to be implemented through the end of fiscal 2014 the restructuring plan includes both voluntary early retirement programs and nonvoluntary workforce reductions significant risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees in addition our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support 

security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across all of those businesses while competing with companies that have much smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition for our products and services and as a result we may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products in addition the performance of our business critical systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for unix servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our itaniumbased products revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business 

if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a changing and hybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute 

on this strategy we need to continue evolving our focus towards the delivery of integrated it solutions for our customers and to continue to invest and expand into cloud computing security big data and mobility any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial results 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions in addition after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or the employees of those contractors or subcontractors in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa emea region china and other highgrowth markets the us federal government spending cuts that went into effect on march 1 2013 may further reduce demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions economic 

weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses particularly our services businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue gross margins and profitability may suffer 

many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance to maintain our competitive position in these markets we must successfully develop and introduce new products and services among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in the price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and challenges of effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with new products meeting customer qualifications and customer evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue and gross margins may decline and our profitability may be harmed 

our revenue and gross margin also may suffer as a result of the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be overlaps in our current products and services and portfolios we have acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margins and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm us in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or services offerings which could result in further costs and delays • oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take 22 

advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin 

• contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectibility risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate any supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations and servers and amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and cash flows 23 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition six of our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 64 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific hp suppliers and oms • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and 

services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa for example as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements the german public prosecutors office the us department of justice and the securities and exchange commission have been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of hp engaged in bribery embezzlement and tax evasion in addition the us enforcement authorities as well as the polish central anticorruption bureau are conducting investigations into potential fcpa violations by a former employee of an hp subsidiary in connection with certain publicsector transactions in poland and the us enforcement authorities are conducting investigations into certain other publicsector transactions in russia poland the commonwealth of independent states and mexico among other countries although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

• managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations • we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers or other thirdparties • business combination and investment transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans • any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable 26 

• our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representatives • our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies • the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated • in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders • we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition • our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate • an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter • business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation • if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example in our third fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our former services segment and a 12 billion impairment charge as a result of an asset impairment analysis of the compaq trade name acquired in 2002 in addition in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with autonomy if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

integration issues are often complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations 27 

in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts 

• consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns • persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with thirdparties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions while we do not currently plan to divest any of our major businesses we do regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if thirdparties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by thirdparties 

we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these thirdparties at all or on reasonable terms or such thirdparties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition thirdparties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp and its customers the number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future if we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly 

the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for 29 

those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances 

• the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our it services business • some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business • some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable thirdparty the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the cash flows of our it services business • if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our profitably could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their 

formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions future stock price performance board of directors executive team our competitors or our industry in general • the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by hp or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flows changes in estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry • developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies two of those rating agencies moodys investors service and standard  poors ratings services downgraded our ratings once during fiscal 2012 and a third rating agency fitch ratings downgraded our ratings twice during 

that fiscal year in addition moodys investors service downgraded our ratings again in november 2012 our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service these downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified 

executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performancebased restricted units some of which contain conditions relating to hps stock price performance and hps longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting sharebased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could 

cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

unforeseen environmental costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers 34 

• specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and • controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp stock

the following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2013 



1 hp consolidated net revenue excludes intersegment net revenue and includes revenue from our corporate investments segment hp consolidated earnings from operations includes the amortization of intangible assets unallocated costs related to certain stockbased compensation expenses restructuring charges corporate and unallocated costs and eliminations a loss from the corporate investments segment and acquisitionrelated charges 

net revenue declined 67 decreased 55 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to revenue declines of approximately 10 8 5 and 3 in our personal systems es eg and printing segments respectively these revenue declines reflect a series of revenue growth challenges that impacted each of our segments to varying degrees the primary challenges included a significant contraction in the overall pc market which impacted personal systems weak public sector spending and enterprise it demand particularly in europe which impacted the es and eg segments competitive pricing pressures in the enterprise and pc markets which impacted both the eg and personal systems segments and unfavorable currency impacts and volume declines in supplies which impacted the printing segment gross margin decreased by 01 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the gross margin decline was due primarily to competitive pricing environments in the markets for eg and personal systems products and decreased revenue and contractual price declines for es partially offsetting these negative impacts was a gross margin increase in printing due primarily to improvements in toner and higher average selling prices for highervalue consumer printers operating margin increased by 156 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to the absence of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2013 additionally total research and development rd and selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased 29 due primarily to rd activity streamlining in eg particularly in business critical systems bcs and cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts that impacted all expense categories

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our business continues to produce significant cash flow from operations generating 116 billion in fiscal 2013 during the year we repaid 57 billion of debt returned 11 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 15 billion worth of common stock in addition we purchased 32 billion in capital assets we ended fiscal 2013 with an investment portfolio of 125 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments which was an increase of approximately 800 million from the end of fiscal 2012 

we entered fiscal 2013 having experienced a multiquarter decline in revenue and operating margins that decline in financial performance reflected a series of challenges that were facing our business some of those challenges related to structural and execution issues such as aligning costs to our revenue trajectory addressing the need to rationalize our rd investments and reinvest in it systems and rebuilding our channel partner relationships other challenges related to dynamic market trends such as the growth of mobility the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure the shift to softwareasaservice saas the transition towards cloud computing and aggressive pricing conditions we also confronted a series of significant macroeconomic challenges in fiscal 2013 such as a shift in consumer spending weak demand in the smb and enterprise sectors in europe and declining growth in some emerging markets 

during fiscal 2013 we continued to address these challenges by driving innovation across the company improving operations aligning our cost structure and rebuilding our balance sheet as a result of these efforts revenue declines have begun to moderate as we reap the early benefits of our investments in product innovation as decreasing costs driven by our restructuring efforts have begun to align to our revenue trajectory as our enterprise services business has begun to become more predictable and as our business performance has begun to improve in our printing business due to our focus on key initiatives such as ink in the office managed print services and ink advantage in addition we made investments targeted at our channel partner relationships through improvements in sales force and channel partner deal pricing tools and reporting infrastructure our strong cash flows from operations in fiscal 2013 also have allowed us to further reduce our debt 

as we enter fiscal 2014 we continue to experience challenges that represent trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to continuing dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems the market shift towards tablets within mobility the market shift to cloudrelated infrastructure software and services and the growth in saas business models another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are going after new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model and gotomarket execution in addition we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in europe the middle east and africa emea china and other highgrowth markets a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below 

• in personal systems we continue to be negatively impacted by the market shift towards tablet products within mobility which has reduced the demand for consumer and notebook products if benefits from our new product investments in this area do not materialize we will continue to be negatively impacted by this trend personal systems is also being impacted by consumer demand weakness particularly in emea and a competitive pricing environment 42 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

• in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility weak consumer demand weak demand in emea and a competitive pricing environment to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories developing emerging market opportunities and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers • in eg we are experiencing revenue declines due to multiple market trends and a highly competitive pricing environment including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products and the transition to cloud computing in addition the market for our bcs products continues to weaken as the overall market for unix products contracts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model and gotomarket execution challenges including improved channel execution and continue to pursue new product innovation such as hp moonshot servers 3par storage and the hp cloudsystem and in the areas of softwaredefined networking blade servers and wireless networking • in es we are facing market and macroeconomic pressures a competitive pricing environment internal execution challenges and weak public sector spending to be successful in addressing these challenges we must execute on our multiyear turnaround plan which includes a cost reduction initiative to align our costs to our revenue trajectory and initiatives targeted at improved execution in the areas of sales performance and accountability contracting practices and pricing • in software we are facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges to be successful in addressing these challenges we must improve our gotomarket execution with integrated customer solutions more aligned to customer demand and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on the important market opportunities in the areas of cloud big data security and mobility to address these challenges we need to continue to pursue new product innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand industry trends and with the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue applying the basic revenue recognition criteria ie when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured along with other revenue recognition principles including industry specific revenue recognition guidance we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation is required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among the elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting only when the delivered elements have standalone value uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights or other contingencies present for the delivered elements for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on the vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in arrangements with multiple elements allocation of the transaction price is determined at inception of the arrangement based on each unit of accountings relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partners have economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent upon any future event if the service is provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are uneven we generally recognize revenue on a straightline basis over the contract term losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period in which such contractual losses become probable and estimable 

we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for certain design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of a fixedprice contract as a result of revisions to cost estimates and overall contract losses where applicable we record such changes in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

for the various software products we sell eg operating system software network enabling software information technology and management software and enterprise security software we assess whether the associated software products were sold stand alone or with the hardware products if the software sold with the hardware product is morethanincidental and is essential to the functionality of the hardware we apply the software accounting guidance we recognize revenue from the sale of 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license for software products within the scope of the software accounting guidance we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements exists such as postcontract support and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue generated from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates on an ifandwhenavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered for software hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in software hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold the associated software revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual licenses or term licenses are sold subject to the above guidance in such software hosting arrangements we consider the rights provided to the customer eg ownership of a license contract termination provisions and feasibility of the customer to operate the software in determining how to account for the license fees in saas arrangements where software licenses are not sold the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription arrangement 

warranty provision 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 29 and 31 of annual net product revenue respectively 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level except for eg and es our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference eg includes two reporting units which are enterprise servers storage and networking essn and technology services ts es also consists of two reporting units which are mphasis limited and the remainder of es in fiscal 2013 we made two changes to our reporting units we identified mphasis limited as a reporting unit apart from the remainder of es and in connection with integration activities we combined the autonomy reporting unit with the legacy hp software business reporting unit 

in the first step of the impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach up to 50 of the concluded reporting unit fair value depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we used the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair values to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could reduce the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount for each reporting unit 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we must perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 14 to approximately 1200 of carrying amounts the software and essn reporting units have the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 31 and 14 respectively in estimating the fair value of our reporting units we have taken into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of august 1 2013 the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair values of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount ranging from approximately 2 to approximately 1000 of the carrying amounts this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in the software and essn reporting units having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 18 and 2 respectively we will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in managements business strategy or significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be potential indicator of impairment 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of the finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation program primarily consists of awards of restricted stock as well as stock options and to a lesser extent other award types the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to hps stock price on the date of grant for stock options determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating fair value requires the use of assumptions including the expected term of the option and the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the option we utilize the blackscholesmerton option pricing formula to value servicebased stock options we determine the expected term using our historical exercise and postvesting termination patterns we determine the expected stock price volatility using implied volatility from options traded on hps stock we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hps stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 

the amount of compensation recognized for awards of restricted stock and options is adjusted for an assumed level of forfeiture due to the presence of service or performance vesting conditions and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award these compensation costs are determined at the aggregate grant level for servicebased awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance andor market conditions to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such adjustments could materially affect our operating results 

for a further discussion on stockbased compensation refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent fiscal year we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year for us federal and state purposes respectively 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 80 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained accordingly our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we state our account receivables balance at net realizable value we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or a deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if the customers circumstances change we would adjust our estimate of the net realizable value of the receivables in addition we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors the financial condition of customers the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions information derived from competitive benchmarking significant onetime events and historical experience the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable 

the annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 004 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2013 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by 48 million 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates and foreign exchange hp mainly holds nonspeculative forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures at october 31 2013 the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was 519 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value every reporting period at october 31 2013 derivative assets and liabilities were 452 million and 656 million respectively 

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset or liability being valued hp generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of its derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability hp uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 8 and note 9 respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates future compensation growth rates and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period the future compensation growth rate assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future outlook the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm asset performance relative to expected longterm asset performance 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2013 changes in the weightedaverage assumptions would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost 

• a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return would have increased our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 65 million • a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 75 million and • an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation growth rate would have increased our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 18 million loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information for a further discussion on litigation and contingencies refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

results of operations 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the fiscal years ended october 31 2013 2012 and 2011 unless otherwise noted all comparative performance data included below reflect yearoveryear comparisons 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in the exchange rate from the prioryear period this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our

operational results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



1 cost of products cost of services and financing interest 2 for fiscal 2012 includes an 88 billion goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge associated with the autonomy reporting unit within the software segment an 80 billion goodwill impairment within the es segment and a 12 billion intangible asset impairment associated with the compaq trade name within the personal systems segment for fiscal 2011 represents impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of palm inc that were recorded as result of the decision announced on august 18 2011 to wind down the webos device business 3 for fiscal 2011 includes 276 million of charges in connection with the acquisition of autonomy which is primarily comprised of the 265 million net cost of british pound options bought to limit foreign exchange rate risk 

net revenue 

fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2013 our total net revenue decreased 67 decreased 55 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased 44 to 403 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 79 to 720 billion 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the components of the weighted net revenue change were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 each of our segments experienced a net revenue decline the leading factors contributing to the declines by segment are as follows 

• personal systems net revenue declined due to the contraction in the overall pc market as a result of a customer shift particularly consumers to tablet products • es net revenue declined due primarily to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts due in part to weak public sector spending and enterprise it demand • eg net revenue declined due to multiple factors including competitive pricing challenges in industry standard servers iss a market decline for unix products impacting bcs declines in ts due in part to lower support for bcs products product transitions in storage and overall weak enterprise it demand • printing net revenue declined due to unfavorable currency impacts particularly the euro and declines in supplies and commercial printers • hpfs net revenue decreased due primarily to lower rental revenue from a decrease in operating lease assets and • software net revenue declined due to lower license and professional services revenues from itcloud management and information management products fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2012 our total net revenue decreased 54 decreased 44 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased 45 to 421 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 59 to 782 billion our revenue decreased due primarily to a weak customer demand environment resulting in volume declines in our hardware businesses and printing supplies coupled with contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts in es software contributed favorably to our total net revenue change as a result of the acquisition of autonomy in october 2011

gross margin 

our total gross margin decreased 01 percentage points and 02 percentage points in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

from a segment perspective the total decrease in our gross margin was due primarily to gross margin decreases in eg personal systems es and software printing and to a lesser extent hpfs experienced gross margin increases the primary factors impacting gross margin performance for each of our segments are summarized below 

• eg experienced a gross margin decline due primarily to competitive pricing pressures in iss and to a lesser extent mix impacts from lower bcs and storage revenue • personal systems experienced a gross margin decline due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing pressures • es gross margin decreased due to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines • software gross margin decreased slightly due to higher development costs in itcloud management products • hpfs gross margin increased slightly due primarily to higher portfolio margins from a lower mix of operating leases and higher margins on early buyouts and • printing gross margin increased due primarily to improvement in toner gross margins as a result of lower discounting and higher average revenue per unit aru in consumer printers fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

from a segment perspective the total decrease in our gross margin was due primarily to gross margin decreases in es eg and to a lesser extent in personal systems printing and software hpfs experienced a gross margin increase the primary factors impacting gross margin performance for each of our segments are summarized below 

• es gross margin decreased due primarily to lower than expected revenue contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts a lower resource utilization rate and additional costs associated with certain contract deliverable delays • eg experienced a gross margin decline due to competitive pricing pressures particularly in iss and to a lesser extent in networking • personal systems gross margin decreased due primarily to higher component costs combined with an unfavorable currency impact • printing experienced a gross margin decrease due to an unfavorable currency impact driven by the strength of the japanese yen and from lower ink supplies volumes as a result of demand declines in all regions • software gross margin decreased due primarily to a lower mix of license revenue and • hpfs gross margin increased due primarily to lower bad debt expense 55

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

a more detailed discussion of segment operating margins is included under segment information below 

operating expenses 

research and development 

rd expense decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the rationalization of rd in eg for bcs cost savings from restructuring and higher value added rd tax subsidy credits the decrease was partially offset by increased rd expense in our storage and iss business units and in software for innovationfocused spending in the areas of converged infrastructure and converged cloud in fiscal 2013 rd expense as a percentage of revenue increased for software personal systems and es decreased for eg and was flat for printing 

rd expense increased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to additional expense from the acquisition of autonomy and innovationfocused spending for storage networking and converged cloud the increase was partially offset by the elimination of rd expense associated with the former webos device business in fiscal 2012 rd expense as a percentage of revenue increased for eg software printing and personal systems and was flat for es 

selling general and administrative 

sga expense decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts that impacted all of our segments partially offsetting the decline was higher marketing expenses to support new product introductions and increased administrative expenses due in part to higher consulting project spending in fiscal 2013 sga expense as a percentage of revenue increased for our eg es hpfs and personal systems segments due in part to the revenue declines taking place in these segments and decreased for our software and printing segments 

sga expense decreased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower marketing costs and 103 million in net gains from the sale of real estate in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2012 sga expense as a percentage of revenue increased for es and personal systems decreased for eg and software and was flat for printing and hpfs 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the intangible asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 related to autonomy and certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods 

amortization expense increased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to the intangible assets purchased as part of the autonomy acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the increase was partially offset by decreased amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods 

for more information on our amortization of intangible assets see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 80 billion and 57 billion associated with es and the acquisition of autonomy respectively in addition we recorded intangible asset 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

impairment charges of 31 billion and 12 billion associated with the acquisition of autonomy and the compaq trade name respectively 

for more information on our impairment charges see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the 21 billion charge recorded in fiscal 2012 for the restructuring plan announced in may 2012 the 2012 plan restructuring charges for fiscal 2013 were approximately 10 billion which included 12 billion of charges related to the 2012 plan that were partially offset by a reversal of 190 million of severance charges related to our fiscal 2010 es restructuring plan 

restructuring charges increased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to the 21 billion charge for the 2012 plan the effect of which was partially offset by lower charges from the fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2010 es restructuring plans restructuring charges for fiscal 2012 were 23 billion which included 21 billion of costs related to the 2012 plan 106 million of costs related to our fiscal 2008 restructuring plan and 75 million of costs related to our fiscal 2010 es restructuring plan 

for more information on our restructuring charges see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

as part of our ongoing business operations we incur workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs workforce rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as we continue to optimize our cost structure workforce rebalancing costs are included in our business segment results and we expect to incur additional workforce rebalancing costs in the future 

acquisitionrelated charges 

in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 we recorded acquisitionrelated charges of 22 million 45 million and 182 million respectively the decrease in fiscal 2013 and 2012 was due primarily to lower consulting and integration costs associated with the autonomy acquisition and a reduced level of acquisition activity 

interest and other net 

interest and other net decreased by 255 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven primarily by lower currency transaction losses coupled with lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances a gain on sale of investments and lower investment losses 

interest and other net increased by 181 million in fiscal 2012 the increase was driven primarily by higher interest expense due to higher average debt balances and higher currency transaction losses 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 215 60 and 212 in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented include china ireland the netherlands puerto rico and singapore we plan to reinvest some of the earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore have not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in addition to the above factors the overall tax rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were impacted by nondeductible goodwill impairments and increases in valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets

segment information 

a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the business segments disclosed 

we have implemented certain organizational realignments as a result of these realignments we reevaluated our segment financial reporting structure and effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 

• we created a new eg segment consisting of our ts business unit which was previously a part of our former essn segment • we created a new es segment consisting of our infrastructure technology outsourcing ito business unit and our application and business services abs business unit both of which were previously a part of our former services segment • we transferred our personal systems commercial products support business from our ts business unit to the other business unit within our personal systems segment • we transferred our enduser workplace support business from our ts business unit to our ito business unit within our new es segment and • we transferred the portion of our business intelligence services business that was a part of our corporate investments segment to our abs business unit within our new es segment as noted above as a result of these changes we created two new reportable segments the eg segment and the es segment also as noted above we eliminated two existing reportable segments the essn segment and the services segment taking into account these changes effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2013 our seven reportable segments are personal systems printing the enterprise group enterprise services software hp financial services and corporate investments 

printing and personal systems group 

printing and personal systems segments were realigned beneath a newly formed printing and personal systems group during fiscal 2012 we describe the results of the business segments within the printing and personal systems group in more detail below 

personal systems 



hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the components of the weighted net revenue change by personal systems business units were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



personal systems net revenue decreased 102 decreased 90 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 the personal systems business continues to experience significant challenges due to the overall pc market contraction as a result of a customer shift particularly consumers to tablet products the business is also experiencing broadbased regional demand weakness particularly in the emea region the decline in personal systems revenue was driven by an 8 decline in unit volume along with a 3 decline in average selling prices asps the unit volume decrease was led by declines in consumer and notebook products as a result of the market shift to tablet products the decline in asps was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment net revenue for consumer clients decreased 19 while net revenue for commercial clients decreased 4 notebook pcs net revenue decreased 15 while desktop pcs net revenue decreased 8 workstations net revenue growth was flat while other net revenue increased 22 the net revenue increase in other was related to increased sales of extended warranties and thirdparty branded options and sales of our newly introduced consumer tablets 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 17 percentage points in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven by a decline in gross margin combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the decline in gross margin was due to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing pressures these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower component and warranty costs and a favorable mix of highermargin commercial products operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due primarily to the size of the revenue decline as well as slightly higher rd costs however operating expenses declined across most other expense categories as a result of our ongoing restructuring efforts 

personal systems net revenue decreased 99 decreased 88 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2012 the revenue decline was due primarily to a decline in unit volumes the effect of which was partially offset by a nominal increase in asps asps increased due primarily to a mix shift toward higherend models the effect of which was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts unit volume was down 11 due primarily to continued demand weakness in both the consumer and commercial markets in fiscal 2012 net revenue from notebook pcs decreased 12 while net revenue from desktop pcs decreased 9 as a result of the overall market decline workstations revenue decreased 3 due to weak demand in the commercial pc market in fiscal 2012 net revenue for consumer clients decreased 15 while commercial client revenue decreased 6 

personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 12 percentage points in fiscal 2012 the decrease was due primarily to a gross margin decline resulting from higher component costs combined with an unfavorable currency impact these negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower warranty and logistics costs benefits from insurance proceeds related to flooding in thailand in july 2011 and an increased level of component vendor 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

rebates in addition operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due primarily to the decline in revenue coupled with increased investments in research and development the effects of which were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses 

printing 



the components of the weighted net revenue change by printing business units were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



printing net revenue decreased 26 decreased 10 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven by unfavorable currency impacts particularly weakness in the euro and declines in supplies and commercial printers net revenue for supplies decreased 3 due to unfavorable currency impacts and lower volumes of toner and ink supplies these effects were partially offset by growth in large format printing supplies printer unit volumes declined by 3 while aru increased by 1 printer unit volumes decreased largely due to declines in lowend consumer printers as we continued our focus on highervalue ink in the office and ink advantage products the increase in aru was driven by a mix shift to highvalue consumer printers the effect of which was partially offset by higher discounting in commercial printers net revenue for commercial hardware decreased 3 which was driven by a 6 decline in aru that was partially offset by a volume increase of 2 the decline in commercial hardware net revenue was partially offset by net revenue growth in the graphics services and managed print services businesses net revenue for consumer hardware remained flat due to a 7 increase in aru the effect of which was offset by a 5 reduction in volume unit volume and aru increased within highvalue consumer printers as a result of our continued focus on those more profitable printers 

printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 17 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in gross margin combined with lower operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the gross margin increase was due to improvement in toner gross margins resulting from lower discounting higher aru in consumer printers and lower cost of sales in toner and commercial printers due to a favorable currency impact from the japanese yen these positive effects were partially offset by an unfavorable mix of lowermargin consumer printers operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due to lower administrative rd and field selling costs as a result of our ongoing restructuring efforts these effects were partially offset by higher marketing expenses to support new product introductions

the components of the weighted net revenue change by es business units were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



es net revenue decreased 82 decreased 71 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 revenue performance in es continues to be challenged by several factors that impact the demand environment including weak public sector spending in the united states and austerity measures in other countries particularly in the united kingdom and weak it services spend due to the mixed global recovery particularly in the emea region the net revenue decrease in es was driven primarily by net service revenue runoff contractual price declines in ongoing contracts and unfavorable currency impacts ito net revenue decreased by 7 in fiscal 2013 due to net service revenue runoff contractual price declines in ongoing contracts and unfavorable currency impacts the effects of which were partially offset by net revenue growth in security and cloud offerings abs net revenue declined 10 in fiscal 2013 the net revenue decline was due primarily to net service revenue runoff and unfavorable currency impacts the effects of which were partially offset by revenue growth in cloud and information and analytics offerings revenue in abs was also negatively impacted by weakness in publicsector spending 

es earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 12 percentage points in fiscal 2013 the decrease was due to a decline in gross margin combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue gross margin declined due primarily to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by our continued focus on improving resource management and profit improvements on underperforming contracts operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due to higher administrative marketing and rd costs these effects were partially offset by reduced field selling costs due to lower headcountrelated costs during the year and other savings from our ongoing restructuring efforts 

es net revenue decreased 25 decreased 04 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2012 due to revenue decreases in all business units ito net revenue decreased by 3 in fiscal 2012 contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts increased deal selectivity designed to meet threshold margins and strategic fit and an unfavorable currency impact contributed to the decrease in revenues these effects were partially offset by an increase in productrelated revenue and increased revenue from cloud and security offerings abs net revenue decreased by 2 in fiscal 2012 the decrease was driven by

declines in shortterm project work combined with an unfavorable currency impact the effect of which was partially offset by increases in sales of cloud and information management and analytics offerings 

es earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 34 percentage points in fiscal 2012 the decrease was due primarily to a gross margin decline driven by lower than expected revenue contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts a lower resource utilization rate and additional costs associated with certain contract deliverable delays these effects were partially offset by a continued focus on operating improvements and cost initiatives that favorably impacted the cost structure of all business units 

software 



software net revenue decreased 36 decreased 26 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 net revenue from licenses and professional services decreased by 17 and 14 respectively while net revenue from saas and support increased by 10 and 8 respectively 

the decline in software revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue from itcloud management and information management products due primarily to a large deal entered into in the prior year and the market shift to saas offerings the revenue decline was also due to lower professional services revenue from itcloud management and information management products as we manage the professional services portfolio to focus on highermargin solutions these declines were partially offset by higher growth in support revenue from our information management and security products and higher revenue growth in our saas offerings from itcloud management and information management products as we shift with the market to providing more saas offerings 

software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 17 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue the effect of which was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher development costs in itcloud management products and the comparative impact of a highly profitable software deal entered into in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by a lower mix of lowermargin professional services revenue the decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by lower field selling costs due to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts

hp financial services 



hpfs net revenue decreased by 50 decreased 42 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 due primarily to lower rental revenue from a decrease in average operating lease assets lower asset recovery services revenue and unfavorable currency impacts these effects were partially offset by higher revenue from remarketing sales and higher finance income from an increase in finance lease assets 

hpfs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 08 percentage points in fiscal 2013 the increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue as a result of higher it investments the increase in gross margin was the result of higher portfolio margin from a lower mix of operating leases higher margin on early buyouts and lower bad debt expense 

hpfs net revenue increased by 62 increased 90 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2012 the net revenue increase was due primarily to portfolio growth along with higher buyout activity and higher endoflease revenue from residual expirations the effects of these changes were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements 

hpfs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 05 percentage points in fiscal 2012 the increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin the increase in gross margin was due primarily to lower bad debt expense the effect of which was partially offset by lower margins on endofterm activities including buyouts and lease extensions operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were flat due to our continued focus on cost efficiencies 

financing originations 



new financing originations which represent the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services including intercompany activity decreased 150 and 26 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively the decrease in new financing originations for both the periods was primarily driven by lower financing associated with hp product sales and services offerings and to a lesser extent unfavorable currency impacts 

portfolio assets and ratios 

the hpfs business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company however intercompany 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 

the portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for hpfs were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



1 portfolio assets include gross financing receivables of approximately 72 billion and 77 billion at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively and net equipment under operating leases of 24 billion at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 as disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference portfolio assets also include capitalized profit on intercompany equipment transactions of approximately 07 billion and 09 billion at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively and intercompany leases of approximately 21 billion at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively both of which are eliminated in consolidation 2 allowance for doubtful accounts includes both the shortterm and the longterm portions of the allowance on financing receivables 3 hpfs debt consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes intercompany debt and 09 billion of borrowing and funding related activity associated with hpfs and its subsidiaries at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 debt allocated to hpfs totaled 108 billion and 113 billion respectively hpfs equity at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 was 15 billion and 16 billion respectively we believe the allocated intercompany debt to equity ratio above is comparable to that of other similar financing companies at october 31 2013 and 2012 hpfs cash balances were 697 million and 700 million respectively 

net portfolio assets at october 31 2013 decreased 46 from october 31 2012 the decrease resulted from lower levels of new financing originations early customer buyouts and unfavorable currency impacts 

hpfs recorded net bad debt expenses of 57 million 54 million and 60 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively

corporate investments 



in fiscal 2013 corporate investments net revenue was primarily related to licensing revenue from hp labs net revenue decreased from fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower residual activity from the webos device business and lower revenue from business intelligence products 

costs and expenses in corporate investments are due to activities in the segment from residual activity related to the webos device business hp labs certain incubation projects corporate strategy and global alliances 

in fiscal 2012 the revenue decrease in corporate investments was a result of lower sales due to the wind down of the webos device business announced in august 2011 

corporate investments reported a smaller loss from operations in fiscal 2012 due primarily to the recognition of charges in fiscal 2011 related to the wind down of the webos device business the loss from operations in corporate investments was also due to expenses associated with corporate strategy global alliances and hp labs 

liquidity and capital resources 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures restructuring activities maturing debt income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to discretionary investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions however our use of a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to borrowing resources under all such conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the united states we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states

could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents total debt and available borrowing resources for each of the three years ended october 31 were as follows 



1 in addition to these available borrowing resources we are able to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in may 2012 the 2012 shelf registration statement 2 available borrowing resources does not include £22 billion 36 billion in borrowing resources under our 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan agreement that was entered into in august 2011 and terminated in november 2011 sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics from our consolidated statements of cash flow

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 10 billion for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was due primarily to the impact of improved payment terms from suppliers and a reduction in payments associated with webos contract cancellations the impact of which was partially offset due to higher cash utilization in inventory net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 21 billion for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease was due primarily to lower net earnings and higher utilization of cash resources for payment of accounts payable the impact of which was partially offset by lower investments in inventory and higher cash generated from collections of accounts and financing receivables 

our key working capital metrics are as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average net revenue our accounts receivable balance was 159 billion as of october 31 2013 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average cost of goods sold our inventory balance was 60 billion as of october 31 2013 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold our accounts payable balance was 140 billion as of october 31 2013 

our working capital requirements depend on effectively managing the cash conversion cycle which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of inventory to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2013 decreased by 4 days compared to fiscal 2012 and is below what we expect to be a longterm sustainable rate the dso remained flat year over year the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory balances relative to the rate of decline in cost of goods sold in most segments as of october 31 2013 the increase in dpo was primarily due to favorable payment term changes partially offset by unfavorable purchasing linearity 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2012 decreased by five days compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease in dso was due primarily to improved collections an increase in cash discounts and a decline in extended payment terms additionally our dso benefited from the currentperiod dso calculation containing a full quarter of revenue from our autonomy acquisition versus the approximately one month of revenue that was included in the priorperiod dso calculation these favorable impacts to

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

dso were partially offset by revenue linearity the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory balances in most segments as of october 31 2012 the increase in dpo was primarily due to improved purchasing linearity 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 07 billion for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower investments in property plant and equipment and higher net sales and maturities of availableforsale securities net cash used in investing activities decreased by 105 billion for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower payments for acquisitions in 2012 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 41 billion for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was due primarily to higher maturities of debt and net repayments of commercial paper net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately 23 billion for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the increase was due primarily to lower net proceeds from the issuance of us dollar global notes and an increase in net repayment of commercial paper the impact of which was partially offset by lower cash paid for repurchases of our common stock

debt levels 



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities overall cost of capital and our targeted capital structure 

shortterm debt and longterm debt decreased by 06 billion and 52 billion respectively for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 both net decreases were due primarily to higher maturities of debt and net repayments of commercial paper the issuances and repayments of commercial paper were 161 billion and 162 billion in fiscal 2013 and 122 billion and 150 billion in fiscal 2012 respectively shortterm debt and longterm debt decreased by 14 billion and 08 billion respectively for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the net decrease in total debt is due primarily to fewer acquisitions and lower levels of share repurchases coupled with debt maturities 

during fiscal 2014 49 billion of us dollar global notes is scheduled to mature for more information on our borrowings see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

our debtequity ratio is calculated as the carrying value of debt divided by the carrying value of equity our debtequity ratio decreased by 043x in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in total debt balances of 58 billion coupled with an increase in stockholders equity by 48 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 our debtequity ratio increased by 046x in fiscal 2012 due primarily to a decrease in stockholders equity of 162 billion at the end of fiscal 2012

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them our ratings as of october 31 2013 were 



two of the major independent rating agencies moodys investors service and standard  poors ratings services downgraded our ratings once during fiscal 2012 and a third rating agency fitch ratings downgraded our ratings twice during that fiscal year moodys investors service also downgraded our longterm debt from a3 to baa1 in november 2012 our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade in our credit ratings by any of the rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we expect to rely on alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of debt or other securities

contractual and other obligations 

the impact that we expect our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2013 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 amounts represent the expected principal cash payments relating to our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments discounts or premiums 2 amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our global notes to variable interest rates the impact of these interest rate swaps was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 4 in fiscal 2014 we expect to contribute approximately 617 million to our nonus pension plans and approximately 33 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants we expect to pay approximately 109 million to cover benefit claims for our postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that they meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes see note 15 to the consolidated financial

5 we expect future cash expenditures of approximately 19 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans we expect to make cash payments of approximately 14 billion in fiscal 2014 with remaining cash payments to be made through fiscal 2017 payments for restructuring have been excluded from the table as they are not contractual and there remains uncertainty as to the timing of these payments see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on restructuring activities 6 in fiscal 2013 we had approximately 3 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 104 million expected to be made within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash payments to the tax authorities as a result of future settlements these obligations are not included in the table see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on our uncertain tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we have thirdparty financing arrangements consisting of revolving shortterm financing intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers the total aggregate capacity of the facilities was 14 billion as of october 31 2013 including an aggregate capacity of 08 billion in nonrecourse facilities and a 06 billion partial recourse facility for more information on our thirdparty financing arrangements see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 75 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2013 were the euro the japanese yen chinese yuan renminbi and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2013 and 2012 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2013 and 2012 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 80 million and 71 million at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables 

we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk 

exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2013 and 2012 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2013 and 2012 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 95 million at october 31 2013 and 121 million at october 31 2012

corporate investments includes business intelligence solutions hp labs the webos business and certain business incubation projects business intelligence solutions enable businesses to standardize on consistent data management schemes connect and share data across the enterprise and apply analytics 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups and purchases of hp products and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated products • independent software vendors isvs that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products • systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with our services business to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and • advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and that typically partner with our services business on client solutions that require our unique products and services the mix of hps business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly hp is focused on driving the depth and breadth of its coverage in addition to efficiencies and productivity gains in both its direct and indirect businesses so while each hp business segment manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution 

strategy the business segments collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate 

for large enterprise customers hp typically assigns an account manager generally from essn or services to manage the customer relationship across hp the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers pps manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while also leading coordination across the businesses for relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems manufacture products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software customization requirements of customers our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel as a supplier of processors and microsoft corporation microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors for processors we also have a relationship with amd and we have continued to see solid acceptance of amd processors in the market 

like other participants in the high technology industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production we also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us 

an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 65 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2012 came from outside the united states the substantial majority of our net revenue originating outside the united states was from customers other than foreign governments 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps foreign operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

we are committed to innovation as a key element of hps culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 34 billion in fiscal 2012 33 billion in fiscal 2011 and 30 billion in fiscal 2010 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2012 and 2011 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 36000 patents which represented a slight decrease over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal 2010 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our ability to access technology of third parties and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segments 

in addition to developing our patents we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the diversity of our products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales often are weaker in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

on a revenue basis we are the largest company offering our range of personal computing and other access devices consulting outsourcing and technology services imaging and printingrelated products and services and enterprise information technology infrastructure we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

personal systems the areas in which personal systems operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by price competition and inventory depreciation our primary competitors for the branded personal computers are lenovo group limited dell inc acer inc asustek 

computer inc apple inc and toshiba corporation in particular regions we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or white box manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the availability of our broadbased distribution of products from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

printing the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive printings key customer segments each face competitive pressure from the market specific to pricing and the introduction of new products key competitors include canon usa inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation seiko epson corporation samsung electronics co ltd and brother industries ltd in addition independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for hp original inkjet and toner supplies which are often available for lower prices and generally offer lower print quality and reliability other companies also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laser and inkjet products particularly outside of the united states where intellectual property protection is inadequate or ineffective printing is focused on growth through innovation and growing highusage unit share by expanding color printing in the office growing longterm highvalue recurring business accelerating the transition from analog to digital printing in graphics commercial and production environments driving web and mobile content solutions through our installed base of webconnected eprinters and growing cloudbased document centric commercial solutions and services our competitive advantages include our comprehensive solutions for the home the office and the publishing environments our innovation and research and development capabilities our brand and the availability of our broadbased distribution of products from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

services our services businesses including hp enterprise services and technology services compete in it support services consulting and integration infrastructure technology outsourcing business process outsourcing and application services the it support services and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as our customers have reduced their it budgets however this trend has benefited the outsourcing services business as customers drive toward lower it management costs to enable more strategic investments our competitors include ibm global services computer sciences corporation systems integration firms such as accenture ltd and offshore companies such as fujitsu limited and indiabased competitors wipro limited infosys limited and tata consultancy services ltd we also compete with other traditional hardware providers such as dell inc which are increasingly offering services to support their products many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition our services businesses team with many companies to offer services and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities our competitive advantages include our deep technology expertise such as multivendor environments virtualization and automation our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources on platforms from sap oracle and microsoft among others 

enterprise servers storage and networking the areas in which essn operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our competitors range from broad solution providers such as international business machines corporation ibm to more focused competitors such as emc corporation and netapp inc in storage cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc in networking and dell inc in industry standard servers we believe that our important competitive advantages in this segment include the six technology components of our converged infrastructure initiatives it systems power and cooling security management virtualization and automation we believe that our competitive advantages also 

include our global reach and our significant intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities 

software the areas in which software operates are fueled by rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies we market enterprise it management software in competition with ibm ca inc bmc software inc and others our information management solutions including unstructured data analytics information governance and digital marketing offerings compete with products from companies like adobe systems incorporated ibm emc corporation open text corporation oracle corporation and symantec corporation we also deliver enterprise securityrisk intelligence solutions that compete with products from symantec corporation ibm cisco systems inc and mcafee inc as new delivery mechanisms such as softwareasaservice come on the scene we are also confronting less traditional competitors our differentiation lies in the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio and the scope of our market coverage 

hp financial services in our financing business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm global financing as well as banks and financial institutions we believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and financial institutions is our ability to finance products services and total solutions 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors see risk factors—competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products some of our products also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we also are subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws they could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations and treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that hp technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with these related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when hp considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on hps operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 

for a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors see risk factors—unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

there are many challenges facing our business many of those challenges relate to structural and execution issues including the following we need to align our costs with our revenue trajectory we need to address our underinvestment in rd and in our internal it systems in recent years which has made us less competitive effective and efficient we need to implement the data gathering and reporting tools and systems needed to track and report on all key business performance metrics so as to most effectively manage a company of our size scale and diversity and we need to rebuild our business relationships with our channel partners we are also facing dynamic market trends such as the growth of mobility the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure the shift to softwareasaservice and the transition towards cloud computing and we need to develop products and services that position us to win in a very competitive marketplace furthermore we face a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including broadbased weakness in consumer spending weak demand in the smb and enterprise sectors in europe and declining growth in some emerging markets particularly china 

we are working to address these challenges during fiscal 2012 we implemented some leadership and organizational changes including consolidating our personal computer and printing businesses under the same senior executive leadership merging our global accounts sales organization into essn and centralizing all of our marketing and communications activities we also began implementing cost reduction initiatives including the companywide restructuring plan discussed below in addition we began making significant changes to our sales force to improve our gotomarket selling activities and reduce cost and we renewed our focus on developing new products services and solutions we also began working to optimize our supply chain reduce the number of stock keeping units skus and platforms refine our real estate strategy improve our business processes and implement consistent pricing and promotions during fiscal 2013 we will be focused on working through the anticipated disruptions expected to accompany the changes made in fiscal 2012 and continuing to implement our cost reduction and operational initiatives we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing them in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with implementing these changes given our large portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the number of acquisitions that we have completed in recent years if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

in may 2012 we announced a companywide restructuring plan expected to be implemented through the end of fiscal 2014 the restructuring plan includes both voluntary early retirement programs and nonvoluntary workforce reductions and is expected to result in 29000 employees exiting the company by the end of that period significant risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees in addition our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions 

are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our operations results and prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across all of those businesses while competing with companies that have much smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 an alliance partner that also markets a line of competing servers announced that it intended to cease software development for our itaniumbased servers which has resulted in orders for our servers being canceled or delayed while we have obtained a court ruling finding that the alliance partner has an obligation to continue developing software for our itaniumbased servers we may continue to experience reduced demand in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin the markets in which we do business are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally in addition competitors in some of the markets in which we compete who have a greater presence in lowercost jurisdictions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloudbased solutions may reduce demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some 

of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with hps supplies business other companies have also developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laserjet and inkjet products particularly in jurisdictions outside of the united states where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist 

if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a changinghybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute on this strategy we need to continue to further evolve the focus of our organization towards the delivery of integrated it solutions for our customers and to invest and expand into cloud computing security and information management and analytics any failure to successfully execute this strategy could adversely affect our operating results 

the process of developing new high technology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations for example as we transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions in addition after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance by thirdparty contractors in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to determine appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our operating margins could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our operating results 

economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased difficulty in managing inventory levels for example in recent periods we have experienced macroeconomic challenges across many geographic regions particularly in the united states and western europe broadbased weakness in consumer demand decelerating growth in china the impact of the continuing uncertainties associated with the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union and austerity measures being implemented or contemplated by various countries in the europe middle east and africa region in addition sustained uncertainty about current global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures inventory writedowns and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses other income and expense could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates hedging expenses and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm us in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of 19 

whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or services offerings resulting in further costs and delays 

• oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin • contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions in the event that we become committed to purchase components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices and our gross margin could suffer in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectibility risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide in the future to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate any supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations and servers and some of those processors are customized for our products new 20 

products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition six of our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

system security risks data protection breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating 

system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected and in the future could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenues overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations moreover the execution of our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of 

variability in our financial results as the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation in the media or investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions stock price performance or executive team • the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by hp or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flow from operations changes in estimates by the investment community or guidance provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry • investor sentiment with respect to our company competitors business partners or industry in general • media coverage of our business and financial performance • any developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain 

jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp and their customers the number of these claims has increased significantly in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future if we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in which groups representing copyright owners have sought to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from hp other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving hp and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and the ability of hp to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 65 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil 

russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific hp suppliers and oms • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

as approximately 65 of our sales are from countries outside of the united states other currencies including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on hps results expressed in us dollars in particular the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency hp sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates as a result we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities if our forecasts are incorrect in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations gains or 

losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act for example as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the german public prosecutors office the us department of justice and the sec have been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of hp engaged in bribery embezzlement and tax evasion or were involved in kickbacks or other improper payments although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margin and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue may suffer 

many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance to maintain our competitive position in these markets we must successfully develop and introduce new products and services among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in the price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and challenges of effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue may decline 

our revenue and gross margin also may suffer as a result of the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be overlaps in the current products and services of hp and portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer 

our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly 

the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their conversion to a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients in the future as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in the short or longterm in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances • the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse affect on the profit margin of our it services business 27 

• some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business • some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business • if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our profitably could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies if we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations our revenue could suffer 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies those rating agencies standard  poors ratings services fitch ratings services and moodys investors service downgraded our ratings on november 30 2011 december 2 2011 and january 20 2012 respectively in addition fitch ratings services and moodys investors service downgraded our ratings a second time on october 5 2012 and november 27 2012 respectively our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service these downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report in addition as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in hps tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition president obamas administration has announced proposals for other us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate there are also other tax proposals that have been introduced that are being considered or that have been enacted by the united states congress or the legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions that could affect our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our other tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there will be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter other developments late in a quarter such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performancebased restricted units some of which contain conditions relating to hps stock price performance and hps longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain in addition the value of all of our sharebased incentive awards depends on hps stock price which declined by nearly 50 during fiscal 2012 if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting sharebased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to hp our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars including the ongoing military operations in afghanistan have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we frequently acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and profitability 

• managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations • we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers or other third parties • business combination and investment transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inprocess research and development charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans • any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable • our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the 31 

veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives 

• our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies • the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters • in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders • we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition • hps effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate • an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter • business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation • if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage hp has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in our third fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our services segment and a 12 billion impairment charge as a result of an asset impairment analysis of the compaq trade name acquired in 2002 in addition in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our autonomy corporation plc autonomy reporting unit within our software segment if there are future changes in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or operating results of our reporting units we may incur additional goodwill impairment charges 

integration issues are often complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business including the business acquired as a result of any business combination and investment transaction the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations 32 

in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts 

• consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns • persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions we also continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation we could incur substantial costs our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and clean up costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which hp could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to hps directors and officers • specifying that hp stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by hp stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors • requiring a vote by the holders of twothirds of hps outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to hp stockholder meetings the board of directors and indemnification and • controlling the procedures for conduct of hps board and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of hp directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation hp also is subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of hps outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp common stock

our strategy and operations are currently focused on the following initiatives 

strategic focus 

the core of our business is our hardware and infrastructure products which include our pc server storage networking and imaging and printing products our software business provides enterprise it management software information management solutions and security intelligencerisk management solutions delivered in the form of traditional software licenses or as softwareasaservice that allow us to differentiate our hardware products and deploy them in a manner that helps our customers solve problems and meets our customers needs to manage their infrastructure operations application life cycles application quality and security business processes and structured and unstructured data our converged infrastructure portfolio of servers storage and networking combined with our cloud service automation software suite enables enterprise and service provider clients to deliver infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice in a private public or hybrid cloud environment layered on top of our hardware and software businesses is our services business which provides opportunities to drive usage of hp products and solutions enables us to implement and manage all the technologies upon which our customers rely and gives us a platform to be more solutionoriented particularly in our focus areas of cloud security and analytics and to be a better strategic partner with our customers 

leveraging our portfolio and scale 

we offer one of the it industrys broadest portfolios of products and services and we are leveraging that portfolio to our strategic advantage for example we are able to provide servers storage and networking products packaged with services that can be delivered to customers in the 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

manner of their choosing be it inhouse outsourced as a service via the internet or via a hybrid environment our portfolio of management software completes the package by allowing our customers to manage their it operations in an efficient and costeffective manner in addition we are working to optimize our supply chain by eliminating complexity reducing fixed costs and leveraging our scale to ensure the availability of components at favorable prices even during shortages we are also expanding our use of industry standard components in our enterprise products to further leverage our scale 

addressing the challenges facing our business 

our business has experienced a multiquarter decline in revenue and operating margins this decline in financial performance reflects a series of challenges facing our business many of those challenges relate to structural and execution issues including the following we need to align our costs with our revenue trajectory we need to address our underinvestment in rd and in our internal it systems in recent years which has made us less competitive effective and efficient we need to implement the data gathering and reporting tools and systems needed to track and report on all key business performance metrics so as to most effectively manage a company of our size scale and diversity and we need to rebuild our business relationships with our channel partners we are also facing dynamic market trends such as the growth of mobility the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure the shift to softwareasaservice and the transition towards cloud computing and we need to develop products and services that position us to win in a very competitive marketplace furthermore we face a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including broadbased weakness in consumer spending weak demand in the smb and enterprise sectors in europe and declining growth in some emerging markets particularly china 

we are addressing these challenges through consistency of leadership focus execution and most importantly superior products services and solutions during fiscal 2012 we implemented some leadership and organizational changes including consolidating our personal computer and printing businesses under the same senior executive leadership merging our global accounts sales organization into essn and centralizing all of our marketing and communications activities we also began implementing costreduction initiatives including a companywide restructuring plan we expect to be implemented through the end of fiscal 2014 in addition we began making significant changes to our sales force to improve our gotomarket selling activities and reduce cost and we renewed our focus on developing new products services and solutions we also began working to optimize our supply chain reduce the number of stock keeping units skus and platforms refine our real estate strategy improve our business processes and implement consistent pricing and promotions during fiscal 2013 we will be focused on working through the anticipated disruptions expected to accompany the changes made in fiscal 2012 and continuing to implement our costreduction and operational initiatives 

investing in our business 

the costreduction and operational efficiency initiatives discussed above are also intended to facilitate increased investment in our business these efforts will include optimizing our supply chain reducing the number of stock keeping units skus and platforms continuing to refine our real estate strategy simplifying our gotomarket improving business processes and implementing consistent pricing and promotions we expect to invest savings from these efforts across our businesses including investing to respond to market trends and customer expectations strengthen our position in our core markets accelerate growth in adjacent markets and drive leadership in the three strategic areas of cloud computing security and information management over time we expect these investments to allow us to expand in higher margin and higher growth industry segments and further strengthen our

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

portfolio of hardware software and services to solve customer problems however the rate at which we are able to invest in our business and the returns that we are able to achieve from these investments will be affected by many factors including the efforts to address the execution industry and macroeconomic challenges facing our business as discussed above as a result we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and the anticipated benefits of these efforts may not materialize 

the following provides an overview of our key fiscal 2012 financial metrics 



1 hp consolidated net revenue includes a reduction of approximately 32 billion primarily related to the elimination of intersegment net revenue and revenue from our corporate investments segment hp consolidated loss earnings from operations includes amounts related to the impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets corporate and unallocated costs and eliminations unallocated costs related to certain stockbased compensation expenses acquisitionrelated charges and a loss from the corporate investments segment 

cash and cash equivalents at october 31 2012 totaled 113 billion an increase of 33 billion from the october 31 2011 balance of 80 billion the increase for fiscal 2012 was due primarily to 106 billion of cash provided from operations the effect of which was partially offset by 31 billion net investment in property plant and equipment 26 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock and pay dividends and 20 billion from the net repayment of debt 

we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting only when the delivered elements have standalone value uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 

we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract we record changes in revenue to income as a result of revisions to cost estimates and overall contract losses where applicable in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we recognize revenue on certain design and build design development andor constructions of software andor systems projects using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 

under our revenue recognition policies we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on the vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority thirdparty evidence of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers the best estimate of selling price esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future as these gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe and esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

warranty provision 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms ongoing product failure rates repair costs product call rates average cost per call and current period product shipments if actual product failure rates repair rates or any other post sales support costs were to differ from our estimates we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 31 of annual net product revenue

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts customer lists distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units due to the recent trading values of our stock price we believed it was appropriate to have recent fair values for each of our reporting units in order to assess the reasonableness of the sum of these fair values as compared to our market capitalization in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit the weighting of the fair value derived from the market approach ranges from 0 to 50 depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we may estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

carrying value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss we also compare the fair value of purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives to their carrying value we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives is less than the carrying value 

we review purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the purchased intangible assets with finite lives are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of these assets and the fair value 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates andor other assumptions as a result when there is a significant decline in our stock price as occurred during fiscal 2012 this reevaluation could correlate to lower estimated fair values for certain or all of our reporting units 

except for services software and corporate investments our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the enterprise services es and technology services ts businesses are the reporting units within the services segment es includes the infrastructure technology outsourcing ito and application and business services abs business units the software segment includes two reporting units which are autonomy corporation plc autonomy and the legacy hp software business the webos business is also a separate reporting unit within the corporate investments segment 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but they are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

during fiscal 2012 we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis for the es reporting unit as a result we recorded an 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

impairment charge within the services segment as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 resulted in an impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets related to the autonomy reporting unit within the software segment as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference other than the impairment charges discussed for the es and autonomy reporting units during fiscal 2012 there was no impairment for hps remaining reporting units the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of august 1 2012 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 9 to approximately 330 of carrying value the autonomy and the legacy hp software reporting units have the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 10 and 9 respectively 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in the autonomy and the legacy hp software reporting units having fair values below their carrying values of 1 and 2 respectively for the remaining reporting units excess fair values over carrying values range from approximately 25 to approximately 290 of the carrying values 

we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in managements business strategy or further significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be a potential indicator of impairment 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we approved a change to our branding strategy for personal computers which triggered an interim impairment review of the compaq trade name indefinitelived intangible asset as a result we recorded an impairment charge within the personal systems group as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference in conjunction with the change in branding strategy we also revised our assumption as to the useful life of the compaq trade name which resulted in a reclassification of the asset from an indefinitelived intangible to a finitelived intangible with a remaining useful life of approximately five years 

restructuring 

we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and the expenses for severance and other employee separation costs including enhanced early retirement programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based upon existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements if the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in the results of operations section and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards net of an estimated forfeiture rate we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to meet the 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

service and performance vesting conditions on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award these compensation costs are determined at the aggregate grant level for servicebased awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance andor market conditions 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards requires subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility we utilize the blackscholes option pricing model to value the servicebased stock options granted under our principal option plans to implement this model we examined our historical pattern of option exercises to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations from this analysis we identified three employee populations to which to apply the blackscholes model we determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hp common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 

we issued performancebased restricted units prus representing hypothetical shares of hp common stock each pru award reflected a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient we determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a threeyear performance period based on results achieved versus goals the performance goals for prus granted in fiscal year 2012 are based on our annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and on our annual revenue growth the performance goals for prus granted prior to fiscal year 2012 are based on our annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and on a market condition based on total shareholder return tsr relative to the sp 500 over the performance period we use our closing stock price on the measurement date to estimate the fair value of the pru awards granted in fiscal year 2012 we use historic volatility for pru awards granted prior to fiscal year 2012 as implied volatility cannot be used when simulating multivariate prices for companies in the sp 500 we estimate the fair value of prus granted prior to fiscal year 2012 using the monte carlo simulation model as the tsr modifier contains a market condition we update the estimated expense net of forfeitures for the cash flow and revenue growth performance against the goal for that year at the end of each reporting period 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions respectively 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 80 foreign countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained however our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our reserve for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest we review our reserves quarterly and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations or new case law previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices execution of advanced pricing agreements resolution with respect to individual audit issues the resolution of entire audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on taxes on earnings 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors including the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors the financial condition of customers the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions significant onetime events and historical experience also we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if the circumstances related to the customer change we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward the annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 010 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2012 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately 23 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2012 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand rapid technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 

fair value of financial instruments 

we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available which may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections financial instruments are primarily comprised of time deposits money market funds corporate and other debt securities equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents and derivative instruments 

cash equivalents and investments we hold time deposits money market funds mutual funds other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds and common stock and equivalents in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly if quoted prices for identical or similar assets are not available we use internally developed valuation models whose inputs include bid prices and third party valuations utilizing underlying asset assumptions 

derivative instruments as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we mainly hold nonspeculative forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

and interest rate exposures when active market quotes are not available we use industry standard valuation models where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves credit risk foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies in certain cases marketbased observable inputs are not available and in those cases we use management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value 

retirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates salary growth and longterm return on plan assets we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the salary growth assumptions reflect our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook longterm return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and managements expectations related to the future economic environment as well as target asset allocations actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics and in general changes if any have moved in the same direction over the last several years for fiscal 2012 changes in the weightedaverage rates for the hp benefit plans would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost 

• a decrease of 25 basis points in the longterm rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 61 million • a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 78 million and • an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 23 million loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion of litigation and contingencies 

constant currency presentation 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue performance on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in the exchange rate from the prioryear period this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on an asreported basis 

results of operations 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the fiscal years ended october 31 2012 2011 and 2010 unless otherwise noted all comparative performance data included below reflect yearoveryear comparisons 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



1 in connection with organizational realignments implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 certain costs previously reported as cost of sales have been reclassified as selling general and administrative expenses to better align those costs with the functional areas that benefit from those expenditures 2 cost of products cost of services and financing interest 3 for the period ended october 31 2012 represents a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of 88 billion associated with the autonomy reporting unit within the software segment a goodwill impairment charge of 80 billion associated with the es reporting unit within the services segment and an intangible asset impairment charge of 12 billion associated with the compaq trade name within the personal systems segment for the period ended october 31 2011 includes impairment charges to goodwill and purchased intangible assets associated with the

net revenue 

the components of the weighted net revenue change were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



1 reflects certain reclassifications made to historical results to conform to the current year presentation as noted in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2012 total hp net revenue decreased 54 decreased 44 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased 45 to 421 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 59 to 782 billion hps revenue decreased due primarily to a weak customer demand environment resulting in volume declines in our hardware businesses and printing supplies coupled with contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts in services the software segment contributed favorably to the total hp net revenue change as a result of the acquisition of autonomy in october 2011 an analysis of the change in net revenue for each business segment is included under segment information below 

fiscal 2011 

in fiscal 2011 total hp net revenue increased 10 decreased 09 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased 10 to 441 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states increased 20 to 831 billion as reflected in the table above the essn segment was the largest contributor to hp net revenue growth as a result of balanced growth across all regions essn segment net revenue growth was helped by the strong performance in products related to our 3par inc 3par and 3com corporation 3com acquisitions an analysis of the change in net revenue for each business segment is included under segment information below

gross margin 

fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2012 total hp gross margin decreased by 02 percentage points gross margins were impacted by continued margin pressure in services and competitive pricing in our hardware businesses along with an unfavorable mix of lowermargin revenue in essn and unfavorable currency impacts 

personal systems gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 the decrease was driven by higher component costs combined with an unfavorable currency impact these negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower warranty and logistics costs benefits from insurance proceeds related to flooding in thailand in july 2011 and an increased level of component vendor rebates 

printing gross margin declined in fiscal 2012 due to an unfavorable currency impact driven by the strength of the japanese yen and from lower ink supplies volumes as a result of demand declines in all regions these effects were partially offset by our focus on higherend inkjet printers combined with a higher mix of supplies 

services gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower than expected revenue contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts a lower than expected resource utilization rate and additional costs associated with certain contract deliverable delays these effects were partially offset by a continued focus on operating improvements and cost initiatives that favorably impacted the cost structure of all business units 

essn gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to competitive pricing pressures particularly in industry standard servers iss and to a lesser extent in networking 

software gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to a lower mix of license revenue the effect of which was partially offset by a highly profitable software deal entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

hpfs gross margin increased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower bad debt expense the effect of which was partially offset by lower margins on endofterm activities including buyouts and lease extensions 

fiscal 2011 

in fiscal 2011 total hp gross margin decreased by 05 percentage points the decline was driven by a lower gross margin in the services printing and corporate investments segments the effect of which was partially offset by a favorable commodity pricing environment in the personal systems and essn segments and a favorable mix from higher software and networking revenue 

personal systems gross margin increased in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of a favorable commodity pricing environment combined with lower warranty costs 

printing gross margin declined in fiscal 2011 due primarily to increased logistics costs and supply chain constraints in laserjet printer engines and toner as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in japan and an unfavorable currency impact driven primarily by the strength of the yen in addition printing gross margin declined due to a continuing mix shift in consumer hardware and commercial hardware toward lower price point products coupled with a lower mix of supplies revenue these effects were partially offset by reductions in printings cost structure as a result of continued efforts to optimize our supply chain 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

services gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower than expected revenue rate concessions arising from recent contract renewals a lower than expected resource utilization rate and a higher mix of lowermargin infrastructure technology outsourcing revenue these effects were partially offset by a continued focus on operating improvements and cost initiatives that favorably impacted the cost structure of both our enterprise services and technology services businesses 

essn gross margin increased in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of lower product costs and a higher mix of networking products the effect of which was partially offset by price declines as a result of competitive pressure 

software gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to rate declines in licenses and services 

hpfs gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower portfolio margins from a higher mix of operating leases the effect of which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue and higher margins on lease extensions and buyouts 

corporate investments gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the impact of the wind down of the webos device business which resulted in expenses for supplierrelated obligations sales incentive programs and inventory write downs 

operating expenses 

research and development 

total research and development rd expense increased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to additional expense from the acquisition of autonomy and innovationfocused spending for storage networking and hp converged cloud these effects were partially offset by the elimination of rd expense associated with the former webos device business in fiscal 2012 rd expense increased for essn software personal systems printing and services and decreased for corporate investments 

total rd expense increased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to additional expenses from acquired companies in fiscal 2011 rd expense increased for essn corporate investments and software and decreased for services and personal systems the increase for essn was driven by acquisition investments and innovationfocused spend in networking and storage products the increase for corporate investments was due to investments in the development of webos and webos devices during the first three quarters of fiscal 2011 

selling general and administrative 

total selling general and administrative sga expense decreased in fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower marketing costs included in sga was 103 million in net gains from the sale of real estate in fiscal 2012 sga expense as a percentage of net revenue was mostly flat for each of our segments except for corporate investments which experienced a decrease 

total sga expense increased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to higher field selling costs as a result of our investments in sales resources to grow revenue the increase in fiscal 2011 was partially offset by 334 million in net gains on the sale of real estate and a 77 million net gain on the divestiture of our halo video collaboration products business in fiscal 2011 sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased for each of our segments except for hpfs services and printing each of which experienced a decrease

for more information on our impairment charges see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

restructuring charges 

the increase in restructuring costs for fiscal 2012 was due primarily to charges of 21 billion for the restructuring plan announced in may 2012 the 2012 plan the effect of which was partially offset by lower charges in the fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2010 es restructuring plans restructuring charges for fiscal 2012 were 23 billion these charges included 21 billion costs related to the 2012 plan 106 million costs related to our fiscal 2008 restructuring plan and 75 million costs related to our fiscal 2010 es restructuring plan 

the decrease in restructuring costs for fiscal 2011 was due primarily to lower charges in the fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2010 es restructuring plans restructuring charges for fiscal 2011 were 645 million these charges included 326 million of severance and facility costs related to our fiscal 2008 restructuring plan 266 million of severance and facility costs related to our fiscal 2010 es restructuring plan and 33 million related to the decision to wind down the webos device business

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to amortization expenses related to the intangible assets purchased as part of the autonomy acquisition this increase was partially offset by decreased amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to increased amortization of purchased intangible assets from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2010 this increase was partially offset by decreased amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods 

for more information on our amortization of purchased intangibles assets see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

acquisitionrelated charges 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded acquisitionrelated charges of 45 million the decrease in acquisitionrelated charges was due primarily to lower consulting and integration costs associated with the autonomy acquisition fewer acquisitions and lower retention bonuses associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal 2011 and 2010 

in fiscal 2011 we recorded acquisitionrelated charges of 182 million the decrease in acquisitionrelated charges was due primarily to lower consulting integration and acquisition costs associated with the electronic data systems corporation and 3com acquisitions the effect of which was partially offset by consulting and integration costs associated with the autonomy acquisition 

interest and other net 

interest and other net expense increased by 181 million in fiscal 2012 the increase was driven primarily by higher interest expense due to higher average debt balances and higher currency transaction losses 

interest and other net expense increased by 190 million in fiscal 2011 the increase was driven by 276 million of charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of autonomy which is primarily comprised of the 265 million net cost of british pound options bought to limit foreign exchange rate risk the increase was also as a result of higher interest expenses due to higher average debt balances the effect of which was partially offset by lower litigation costs and lower currency transaction losses 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 60 212 and 202 in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented include singapore the netherlands china ireland and puerto rico we plan to reinvest some of the earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore have not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings 

in addition to the above factors the overall tax rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were impacted by nondeductible goodwill impairments and increases in valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our provision for taxes see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

portfolio assets and ratios 

hpfs maintains a strategy to generate a competitive return on equity by effectively leveraging its portfolio against the risks associated with interest rates and credit the hpfs business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company however certain intercompany loans and accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements

corporate investments 



net revenue in corporate investments in fiscal 2012 relates primarily to business intelligence solutions and the former webos device business in fiscal 2012 the revenue decrease was a result of lower sales due to the wind down of the webos device business announced in august 2011 

corporate investments reported a smaller loss from operations in fiscal 2012 due primarily to the absence in the current period of charges recognized in the prior period related to the wind down of the webos device business the loss from operations in corporate investments was also due to expenses carried in the segment associated with corporate strategy global alliances and hp labs

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the united states amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes on repatriation of amounts held

outside of the united states to have a material effect on hps overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support business operations capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to discretionary investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this nearterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the market risks identified in the section entitled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a 



1 in addition to these available borrowing resources we are able to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec in may 2012 the 2012 shelf registration statement 2 available borrowing resources does not include £22 billion 36 billion in borrowing resources under our 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan agreement that was entered into in august 2011 and terminated in november 2011 

our cash position remains strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover cash outlays expected in fiscal 2013 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics from our consolidated statements of cash flow

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 21 billion for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease was due primarily to lower net earnings and higher utilization of cash resources for payment of accounts payable the impact of which was partially offset by lower investment in inventory and higher cash generated from collections of accounts and financing receivables net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 07 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was due primarily to higher cash generated through the utilization of operating assets primarily accounts and financing receivables and lower utilization of cash resources for payment of accounts payable the impact of which was partially offset by decreases in net earnings and cash utilized as a result of higher inventory levels 

our key working capital metrics are as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average net revenue our accounts receivable balance was 164 billion as of october 31 2012 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average cost of goods sold our inventory balance was 63 billion as of october 31 2012 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold our accounts payable balance was 134 billion as of october 31 2012 

our working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2012 decreased by five days compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease in dso was due primarily to improved collections an increase in cash discounts and a decline in extended payment terms additionally our dso benefited from the currentperiod dso calculation containing a full quarter of revenue from our autonomy acquisition versus the approximately one month of revenue that was included in the priorperiod dso calculation these favorable impacts to dso were partially offset by revenue linearity the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory balances in most segments as of october 31 2012 the increase in dpo was primarily due to improved purchasing linearity 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2011 increased by five days as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in dso was primarily the result of unfavorable impact on receivables from the autonomy acquisition extended payment terms and an increase in unbilled and aged accounts receivables the effect of which was offset by a favorable currency impact due to the strengthening us dollar the increase in dos was a result of higher inventory levels at october 31 2011 due primarily to a macro economic slowdown impacting our consumer businesses the timing of shipments in our commercial hardware businesses and strategic purchases of certain components dpo remained flat year over year 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 105 billion for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower investments in acquisitions in 2012 net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 26 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to higher investments in acquisitions in 2011 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately 23 billion for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the increase was due primarily to lower net proceeds from the issuance of us dollar global notes and an increase in net repayment of commercial paper the impact of which was partially offset by lower cash paid for repurchases of our common stock net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 13 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease was due primarily to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of our common stock the impact of which was partially offset by higher net repayment of commercial paper and a decrease in cash received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans

shortterm debt and longterm debt decreased by 14 billion and 08 billion respectively for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the net decrease in total debt is due primarily to fewer acquisitions and lower levels of share repurchases coupled with maturities in some obligations in fiscal

2011 shortterm debt and longterm debt increased by 10 billion and 73 billion respectively as compared to fiscal 2010 the net increase in total debt is due primarily to investments in acquisitions and share repurchases 

during fiscal 2013 55 billion of us dollar global notes will mature we expect to have sufficient cash cash from operations and access to capital markets to repay those maturing global notes 

our debtequity ratio is calculated as the carrying value of debt divided by the carrying value of equity our debtequity ratio increased by 046x in fiscal 2012 due primarily to a decrease in shareholders equity by 162 billion at the end of fiscal 2012 our debtequity ratio increased by 024x in fiscal 2011 due primarily to the issuance of 116 billion of us dollar global notes and a decrease in shareholders equity by 18 billion at the end of fiscal 2011 

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the year it factors in the impact of swapping some of our global notes with fixed interest rates for global notes with floating interest rates for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the low weightedaverage interest rate over the past three years is a result of a combination of lower market interest rates and swapping some of our fixedinterest obligations associated with some of our fixedrate us dollar global notes for variablerate obligations through interest rate swaps in a declining rate environment 

for more information on our borrowings see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

available borrowing resources 

at october 31 2012 we had the following resources available to obtain shortterm or longterm financings if we need additional liquidity 



1 for more information on our available borrowings resources see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them the ratings as of october 31 2012 were

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our credit ratings were downgraded by fitch ratings services to f2 and a in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 moodys investors service subsequently downgraded our longterm debt from a3 to baa1 in november 2012 our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt these downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade in our credit ratings by any of the three rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we will rely on alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of debt or other securities under our existing shelf registration statement if necessary to offset reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper 

contractual and other obligations 

the impact that we expect our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2012 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 amounts represent the expected principal cash payments relating to our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts and premiums 2 amounts represent the expected interest cash payments relating to our longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with some of our fixed global notes for variable rate obligations the impact of these interest rate swaps was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services

income tax obligations 

in addition to the above at october 31 2012 we had approximately 23 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertainty in income tax positions which will be partially offset by 338 million of deferred tax assets and interest receivable these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 81 million expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on taxes 

restructuring funding commitments 

as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect future cash expenditures of approximately 27 billion we expect to make cash payments of approximately 16 billion in fiscal 2013 with remaining cash payments through fiscal 2016 in addition to these cash expenditures we expect to fund approximately 833 million of the enhanced early retirement program eer announced in may 2012 through use of our us pension plan assets the use of plan assets to fund the us eer in fiscal 2012 did not cause us to increase our funding to our us pension plan see note 8 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference for additional information on our restructuring plans and pension activities respectively we expect to use a combination of cash from operations and our available borrowing resources to meet our nearterm funding commitments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 75 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2012 were the euro the japanese yen chinese yuan renminbi and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany lease loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures for these types of derivatives and hedges we recognize the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currencydenominated exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2012 and 2011 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2012 and 2011 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of 71 million and 96 million at october 31 2012 and october 31 2011 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased 

floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2012 and 2011 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investment instruments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments interest rate swaps and financing receivables the discount rates we used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2012 and 2011 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investment instruments and financing receivables net of interest rate swap positions of 121 million at october 31 2012 and 145 million at october 31 2011 

equity price risk 

we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities which had an estimated fair value of 59 million at october 31 2012 and 118 million at october 31 2011 we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis generally we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities however we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of approximately 18 million and 35 million at october 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the aggregate cost of investments in privatelyheld companies and other investments was 59 million at october 31 2012 and 57 million at october 31 2011

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups and distribution is organized by direct and channel within the channel we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups the partners include 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships • independent distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no presence • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated products • independent software vendors isvs that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products • systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with our services business to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and • advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and that typically partner with our services business on client solutions that require our unique products and services the mix of hps business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions necessitate sales marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly hp is focused on driving the depth and breadth of its coverage in addition to efficiencies and productivity gains in both the direct and indirect business 

hps enterprise sales and marketing organization enterprise sales manages most of our enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also has primary responsibility for simplifying sales processes across our segments to improve speed and effectiveness of customer delivery in this 

capacity enterprise sales also works closely with hps enterprise businesses services essn and hp software which manage specialty resources focused on their specific products including unix servers storage networking software and support offerings enterprise sales manages our direct distribution activities for commercial products and gotomarket activities with systems integrators and isvs enterprise sales also is responsible for driving hps horizontal and vertical solutions with both hps enterprise services business and the partners listed above in addition enterprise sales drives hps vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication media and entertainment financial services manufacturing and distribution and public sector industries 

psg manages smb customer relationships and commercial reseller channels relationships due largely to the significant volume of commercial pcs that hp sells through these channels psg also leads the volume direct organization which is charged with the processing of direct sales for volume products in addition psg manages direct online sales through the consumer exchange and the small business exchange 

ipg manages hps overall consumerrelated sales and marketing relationships ipg also manages consumer channel relationships with thirdparty retail locations for imaging and printing products as well as other consumer products including consumer pcs which provides for a bundled sale opportunity between pcs and ipg products 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems manufacture products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software customization requirements of customers our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel as a supplier of processors and microsoft corporation microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors for processors we also have a relationship with amd and we have continued to see solid acceptance of amd processors in the market 

like other participants in the high technology industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production we also acquire 

component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 65 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2011 came from outside the united states the substantial majority of our net revenue originating outside the united states was from customers other than foreign governments 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps foreign operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

we remain committed to innovation as a key element of hps culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 33 billion in fiscal 2011 30 billion in fiscal 2010 and 28 billion in fiscal 2009 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where proprietary rights will improve our 

competitive position at october 31 2011 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 36000 patents which represents a slight decrease over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal 2010 but an increase over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal 2009 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our ability to access technology of third parties and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments 

in addition to developing our patents we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the diversity of our products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales often are weaker in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products some of our products also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we also are subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws they could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines

 item 1a risk factors 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our operations results and prospects could be harmed 

unlike many of our competitors we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 an alliance partner that also markets a line of competing servers announced that it intends to cease software development for our itaniumbased servers which has resulted in orders for our servers being canceled or delayed if that decision is not reversed or if another solution is not successfully implemented there would be reduced demand for our itaniumbased servers over the longer term in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin the markets in which we do business particularly the personal computer and printing markets are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for these products in addition competitors in some of the markets in which we compete with a greater presence in lowercost jurisdictions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloudbased solutions may reduce demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with hps supplies business other companies have also developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laserjet and inkjet products particularly in jurisdictions outside of the united states where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist 

if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a changinghybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for solutions to successfully execute on this strategy we need to continue to evolve our historically hardwarecentric business model towards a model that includes more software and higher value services offerings in addition we need to continue to further evolve the focus of our organization towards the delivery of integrated it solutions for our customers any failure to successfully execute this strategy could adversely affect our operating results 

the process of developing new high technology products services and solutions and enhancing existing products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations for example as we transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in third party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance by thirdparty contractors in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to determine appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our operating margins could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers 

expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could adversely affect our operating results 

economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty including the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the united states and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and difficulty managing inventory levels in addition sustained uncertainty about current global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures inventory writedowns and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets could lead to increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses other income and expense could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates hedging expenses and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe and the long lead times that are required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us in addition our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive time consuming and resourceintensive than expected other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example 18 

as discussed under business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses below we obtain disk drive components from suppliers with operations in thailand that have been severely impacted by the recent floods in that region which has caused a shortterm reduction in the supply of those components in addition our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings resulting in further costs and delays 

• oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin • contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions in the event that we become committed to purchase components or services for prices in excess of the current market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices and our gross margin could suffer in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may have risk of uncollectability in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide in the future to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers as described above our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we 19 

rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations and servers and some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity or price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition all six of our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown however in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer 

in late july 2011 thailand began experiencing severe flooding that has caused widespread damage to the local manufacturing industry hp obtains disk drive components used in its pcs servers and storage devices from suppliers with operations in thailand that were and continue to be severely impacted by the flooding we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a shortterm reduction in the supply of these disk drive components if we are unable to support our ongoing demand for disk drive components the revenue gross margins and results of operations of our pc server and storage businesses may be adversely affected 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our clients including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected in the past and in the future could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenues overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly 

basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation in the media or investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions stock price performance or executive team • the announcement of new or planned products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by hp or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flow from operations changes in estimates by the investment community or guidance provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition following periods of volatility in a companys securities securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted if instituted against hp this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp and their customers the number of these claims has increased significantly in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future if we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in which groups representing copyright owners sought to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from hp other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving hp and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and the ability of hp to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 65 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts 23 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific hp suppliers and oms • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

as approximately 65 of our sales are from countries outside of the united states other currencies including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on hps results expressed in us dollars in particular the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency hp sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates as a result we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities if our forecasts are incorrect in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act for example as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

the german public prosecutors office the us department of justice and the sec have been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of hp engaged in bribery embezzlement and tax evasion or were involved in kickbacks or other improper payments although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margin and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue may suffer 

many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance to maintain our competitive position in these markets we must successfully develop and 

introduce new products and services among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue may decline 

our revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be overlaps in the current products and services of hp and portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer 

our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our it services business properly 

the size and significance of the it services portion of our business have increased in recent periods the risks that accompany that business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse affect on the profit margin of our it services business • some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business • some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate 26 

adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business 

if we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations our revenue could suffer 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies two of those rating agencies standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services downgraded our ratings on november 30 and december 2 2011 respectively our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by fitch ratings services and have been under review for possible downgrade by moodys investors service since october 28 2011 these downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report in addition as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in hps tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition president obamas administration has announced proposals for other us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate there are also other tax proposals that have been introduced that are being considered or that have been enacted by the united states congress or the legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions that could affect our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our other tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there will be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter other developments late in a quarter such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to execute on our strategy for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected 

we have an operating framework that includes a disciplined focus on operational efficiency as part of this framework we have adopted several initiatives including our ongoing initiative to transform our supply chain and leverage our corporate infrastructure and a more recent initiative to implement better tools standardize key processes integrate critical it systems minimize redundant or legacy systems and take other actions to improve our productivity sales forecasting and business decisions we also implemented a multiyear restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 relating to our enterprise services business 

our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with implementing changes to our tools processes and systems given our large portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the number of acquisitions that hp has completed in recent years there are also significant risks associated with our enterprise services workforce restructuring plan including potential delays in the implementation of that plan in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes to our tools processes and systems if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performancebased restricted units some of which contain conditions relating to hps stock price performance and hps longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to hp our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems 

or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars including the military operations now being wound down in iraq and the ongoing military operations in afghanistan have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses divest noncore businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products or employees we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees suppliers or other third parties in addition the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make these transactions less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we fail to identify and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and profitability 

integration issues are often complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns 30 

• persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations these business combination and investment transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inprocess research and development charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans moreover hp has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets in order to complete an acquisition we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders we may also borrow to finance acquisitions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition related or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition in addition hps effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate we also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close as a result any completed pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter 

unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation we could incur substantial costs our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and clean up costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint 

and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which hp could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to hps directors and officers • specifying that hp stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by hp stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors • requiring a vote by the holders of twothirds of hps outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to hp stockholder meetings the board of directors and indemnification and • controlling the procedures for conduct of hp board and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of hp directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation hp also is subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of hps outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp common stock

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

cash and cash equivalents at october 31 2011 totaled 80 billion a decrease of 29 billion from the october 31 2010 balance of 109 billion the decrease for fiscal 2011 was due primarily to 105 billion of net cash paid for business acquisitions 101 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock and 35 billion net investment in property plant and equipment the effect of which was partially offset by 126 billion of cash provided from operations and 83 billion from the net issuance of debt 

we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

revenue for each element we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting only when the delivered elements have standalone value uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 

we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract we record changes in revenue to income as a result of revisions to cost estimates in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

we recognize revenue on certain design and build design development andor constructions of software andor systems projects using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 

under our revenue recognition policies we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on the vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority thirdparty evidence of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers the best estimate of selling price esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future as these gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe and esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year which may change the pattern and timing of 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

warranty provision 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms ongoing product failure rates repair costs product call rates average cost per call and current period product shipments if actual product failure rates repair rates or any other post sales support costs were to differ from our estimates we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 33 of annual net product revenue while actual annual warranty costs have experienced favorable trends and averaged approximately 32 of annual net product revenue 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts customer lists distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

reporting unit to its carrying value in general our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference however for the webos business within corporate investments the reporting unit is one step below the segment level we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference we also compare the fair value of purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives to their carrying value we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 resulted in an impairment charge for the webos business as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference there was no impairment for hps remaining reporting units the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of hps reporting units as of august 1 2011 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 04 billion to approximately 256 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately 02 billion to approximately 227 billion for each of hps reporting units 

we also performed our annual impairment analysis of the indefinitelived intangible asset valued at 14 billion there was no impairment of the indefinitelived intangible as a result of the analysis the excess of fair value over carrying value of the compaq trade name in the psg business is approximately 144 million as of august 1 2011 the annual testing date in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of the intangible which resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying value of approximately 13 million in addition if a future change in hps branding strategy resulted in the reclassification of the compaq trade name from an indefinitelived intangible to a definitelived intangible there would be a significant decrease in the fair value of the asset 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we will continue to evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events changes in circumstances or changes in management business strategy indicate that there may be a potential indicator of impairment on december 9 2011 we announced that we had determined to contribute the webos software to the open source community we are currently evaluating the impact that this decision will have on the 273 million in related intangible assets and goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 

restructuring 

we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and the expenses for severance and other employee separation costs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs if the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in the results of operations section and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards net of an estimated forfeiture rate we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award these compensation costs are determined at the aggregate grant level for servicebased awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance andor market conditions 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards requires subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility we utilize the blackscholes option pricing model to value the servicebased stock options granted under our principal option plans to implement this model we examined our historical pattern of option exercises to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations from this analysis we identified three employee populations to which to apply the blackscholes model we determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hp common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 

we issued performancebased restricted units prus representing hypothetical shares of hp common stock each pru award reflected a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient we determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a threeyear performance period based on results achieved versus goals based on our annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and total shareholder return tsr relative to the sp 500 over the performance period we use historic volatility for pru awards as implied volatility cannot be used when simulating multivariate prices for companies in the sp 500 we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation model as the tsr modifier contains a market condition we update the estimated expense net of forfeitures for the cash flow performance against the goal for that year at the end of each reporting period 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions respectively 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 80 foreign countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained however our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our reserve for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest we review our reserves quarterly and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations or new case law previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices execution of advanced pricing agreements resolution with respect to individual audit issues the resolution of entire audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on taxes on earnings 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors including the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors the financial condition of customers the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions significant onetime events and historical experience also we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if the circumstances related to the customer change we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward the annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 016 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2011 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately 62 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2011 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand rapid technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 

fair value of financial instruments 

we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available which may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections financial instruments are primarily comprised of time deposits money market funds commercial paper corporate and other debt securities equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents and derivative instruments 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

cash equivalents and investments we hold time deposits money market funds commercial paper other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds and common stock and equivalents in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly if quoted prices for identical or similar assets are not available we use internally developed valuation models whose inputs include bid prices and third party valuations utilizing underlying asset assumptions 

derivative instruments as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we mainly hold nonspeculative forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures when active market quotes are not available we use industry standard valuation models where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves credit risk foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies in certain cases marketbased observable inputs are not available and in those cases we use management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value 

retirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates salary growth and longterm return on plan assets we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixedincome investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the salary growth assumptions reflect our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook longterm return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and managements expectations related to the future economic environment as well as target asset allocations 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics and in general changes if any have moved in the same direction over the last several years for fiscal 2011 changes in the weightedaverage rates for the hp benefit plans would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost 

• a decrease of 25 basis points in the longterm rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 56 million • a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 82 million and • an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 18 million loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion of litigation and contingencies 

accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to the fasb accounting standards codification relating to the presentation of comprehensive income in our financial statements the amendments require the presentation of total comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements we will adopt these amendments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

constant currency presentation 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue performance on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in the exchange rate from the prioryear period this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on an asreported basis

net revenue 

the components of the weighted net revenue change were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



1 reflects certain reclassifications made to historical results to conform to the current year presentation as noted in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

fiscal 2011 

in fiscal 2011 total hp net revenue increased 10 decreased 09 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased 10 to 441 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states increased 20 to 831 billion as reflected in the table above the essn segment was the largest contributor to hp net revenue growth as a result of balanced growth across all regions essn segment net revenue growth was helped by the strong performance in products related to our 3par inc 3par and 3com corporation 3com acquisitions an analysis of the change in net revenue for each business segment is included under segment information below 

fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2010 total hp net revenue increased 100 83 on a constant currency basis us net revenue increased 78 to 445 billion while net revenue from outside of the united states increased 113 to 815 billion for fiscal 2010 the psg segment was the largest contributor to hp net revenue growth as a result of balanced growth across the regions an analysis of the change in net revenue for each business segment is included under segment information below 

gross margin 

fiscal 2011 

in fiscal 2011 total hp gross margin decreased by 05 percentage points the decline was driven by a lower gross margin in the services ipg and corporate investments segments the effect of which was partially offset by a favorable commodity pricing environment in the psg and essn segments and a favorable mix from higher hp software and hp networking revenue 

psg gross margin increased in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of a favorable commodity pricing environment combined with lower warranty costs 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

services gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower than expected revenue rate concessions arising from recent contract renewals a lower than expected resource utilization rate and a higher mix of lowermargin infrastructure technology outsourcing revenue the decrease was partially offset by a continued focus on operating improvements and cost initiatives that favorably impacted the cost structure of both our enterprise services and technology services businesses 

ipg gross margin declined in fiscal 2011 due primarily to increased logistics costs and supply chain constraints in laserjet printer engines and toner as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in japan and an unfavorable currency impact driven primarily by the strength of the yen in addition ipg gross margin declined due to a continuing mix shift in consumer hardware and commercial hardware toward lower price point products coupled with a lower mix of supplies revenue these effects were partially offset by reductions in ipgs cost structure as a result of continued efforts to optimize our supply chain 

essn gross margin increased in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of lower product costs and a higher mix of networking products the effect of which was partially offset by price declines as a result of competitive pressure 

hp software gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to rate declines in licenses and services 

hpfs gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower portfolio margins from a higher mix of operating leases the effect of which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue and higher margins on lease extensions and buyouts 

corporate investments gross margin decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the impact of the wind down of the webos device business which resulted in expenses for supplierrelated obligations sales incentive programs and inventory write downs 

fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2010 total hp gross margin increased by 03 percentage points the increase was a result of an increased mix in networking products and rate increase in services the effect of which was partially offset by strong revenue growth in personal computers and printer hardware that have lower gross margins 

psg gross margin declined in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of higher component costs the effect of which was partially offset by lower warranty and logistics expenses 

services gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 due primarily to the continued focus on operating improvements including delivery efficiencies and cost controls in our technology services business and acquisition synergies related to the acquisition of electronic data systems corporation eds 

ipg gross margin declined in fiscal 2010 due primarily to a higher mix of hardware and a correspondingly lower mix of supplies the effect of which was partially offset by cost savings associated with our ongoing efforts to optimize our supply chain 

essn gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 due primarily to lower product costs and strong volume the effect of which was partially offset by a product mix shift resulting from the strength in industry standard servers iss which has lower gross margins 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

hp software gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of a higher license and support mix the effect of which was partially offset by a reduced services gross margin rate 

hpfs gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of higher portfolio margins due to favorable financing conditions and higher remarketing margin the effect of which was partially offset by higher bad debt and lower buyout margin 

corporate investments gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of the impact from the acquisition palm inc palm 

operating expenses 

research and development 

total research and development rd expense increased in fiscal 2011 due primarily to additional expenses from acquired companies in fiscal 2011 rd expense increased for essn corporate investments and hp software and decreased for services and psg the increase for essn was driven by acquisition investments and innovationfocused spend in networking and storage products the increase for corporate investments was due to investments in the development of webos and webos devices during the first three quarters of fiscal 2011 

total rd expense increased in fiscal 2010 due primarily to additional expenses from acquired companies in fiscal 2010 rd expense increased for essn ipg corporate investments hp software and services and decreased for psg

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 212 202 and 186 in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented include singapore the netherlands china ireland and puerto rico we plan to reinvest some of the earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore have not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings 

the increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to nondeductible goodwill and increases in valuation allowances the increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in the income tax benefits related to foreign earnings

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the united states a majority of the amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states repatriation could result in additional us federal income tax payments 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes on repatriation of amounts held outside of the united states to have a material effect on hps overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support business operations capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to discretionary investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this nearterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the market risks identified in the section entitled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a 



1 in addition to these available borrowing resources we are able to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec in may 2009 the 2009 shelf registration statement 2 available borrowing resources does not include £22 billion 36 billion in borrowing resources under our 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan agreement that was entered into in august 2011 and terminated in november 2011 

our cash position remains strong and we believe our cash balances and anticipated cash flow generated from operations are sufficient to cover cash outlays expected in fiscal 2012 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics from our consolidated statements of cash flow

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 07 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was due primarily to higher cash generated through the utilization of operating assets primarily accounts and financing receivables and lower utilization of cash resources for payment of accounts payable the impact of which was partially offset by decrease in net earnings and cash utilized as a result of higher inventory levels net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 15 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the decrease was due primarily to an increase in accounts and financing receivables resulting from higher revenues in the fourth quarter and higher payments for account payable activities the impact of which was partially offset by the increase in net earnings 

our key working capital metrics are as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average net revenue our accounts receivable balance was 182 billion as of october 31 2011 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average cost of goods sold our inventory balance was 75 billion as of october 31 2011 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold our accounts payable balance was 147 billion as of october 31 2011 

our working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2011 increased by five days as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in dso was primarily the result of unfavorable impact on receivables from the autonomy acquisition extended payment terms and an increase in unbilled and aged accounts receivables the effect of which was offset by a favorable currency impact due to the strengthening us dollar the increase in dos was a result of higher inventory levels at october 31 2011 due primarily to a macro economic slow down impacting our consumer businesses the timing of shipments in our commercial hardware businesses and strategic purchases of certain components dpo remained flat year over year 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2010 increased by seven days as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in dso was due primarily to linearity and fewer cash discounts in the fourth quarter dos 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

remained flat year over year the decrease in dpo was due primarily to a change in purchasing linearity in the fourth quarter 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 26 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and increased by approximately 78 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increases were due primarily to higher investments in acquisitions in both 2011 and 2010 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 13 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease was due primarily to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of our common stock the impact of which was partially offset by higher net repayment of commercial paper and a decrease in cash received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 38 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the decrease was due primarily to a higher net issuance of commercial paper the impact of which was partially offset by increased repurchases of our common stock and lower global debt issuances

our debtequity ratio is calculated as the carrying value of debt divided by the carrying value of equity our debtequity ratio increased by 024x in fiscal 2011 due primarily to the issuance of 116 billion of us dollar global notes and a decrease in shareholders equity by 18 billion at the end of fiscal 2011 our debtequity ratio increased by 016x in fiscal 2010 due primarily to the issuance

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

standard  poors ratings services downgraded our shortterm and long term ratings on november 30 2011 and fitch ratings services downgraded our long term ratings on december 2 2011 accordingly the ratings as of december 14 2011 were 



our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by fitch ratings services and have been under review for possible downgrade by moodys investors service since october 28 2011 while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt these downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade in our credit ratings by any of the three rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we will rely on alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of debt or other securities under our existing shelf registration statement if necessary to offset reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper 

contractual and other obligations 

the impact that we expect our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2011 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 amounts represent the expected principal cash payments relating to our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts and premiums 2 amounts represent the expected interest cash payments relating to our longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with some of our fixed global notes for variable rate obligations the impact of these interest rate swaps was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the

transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

in addition to the above at october 31 2011 we had approximately 21 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertainty in income tax positions which will be partially offset by 293 million of deferred tax assets and interest receivable these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 77 million expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on taxes 

funding commitments 

in fiscal 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 658 million to our pension and postretirement plan funding our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities funding for the years following 2012 would be based on the then current market conditions actuarial estimates and plan funding status see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on pension activity 

as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect future cash expenditures of approximately 11 billion we expect to make cash payments of approximately 09 billion in fiscal 2012 with remaining cash payments through 2016 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on restructuring activities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 76 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2011 were the euro the japanese yen chinese yuan renminbi and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany lease loan denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures for these types of derivatives and hedges we recognize the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currencydenominated exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2011 and 2010 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2011 and 2010 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of 96 million and 122 million at october 31 2011 and october 31 2010 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then typically use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily us dollar 

liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2011 and 2010 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investment instruments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments interest rate swaps and financing receivables the discount rates we used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2011 and 2010 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investment instruments and financing receivables net of interest rate swap positions of 145 million at october 31 2011 and 28 million at october 31 2010 

equity price risk 

we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities which had an estimated fair value of 117 million at october 31 2011 and 9 million at october 31 2010 we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis generally we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities however we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of approximately 35 million and 3 million at october 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the aggregate cost of investments in privatelyheld companies and other investments was 57 million at october 31 2011 and 163 million at october 31 2010

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups and distribution is organized by direct and channel within the channel we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups the partners include 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships 7 

• independent distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no presence • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated products • independent software vendors isvs that provide their clients with specialized software products frequently driving sales of additional nonhp products and services and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products and • systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with hps to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services the mix of hps business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions necessitate sales marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly hp is focused on driving the depth and breadth of its coverage in addition to efficiencies and productivity gains in both the direct and indirect business 

the hp enterprise business manages most of our enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also has primary responsibility for simplifying sales processes across our segments to improve speed and effectiveness of customer delivery in this capacity the hp enterprise business manages our direct sales for value products including unix® enterprise storage and software and presales technical consultants as well as our direct distribution activities for commercial products and gotomarket activities with systems integrators and isvs the hp enterprise business also drives hps vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication media and entertainment financial services manufacturing and distribution and public sector industries 

psg manages smb customer relationships and commercial reseller channels due largely to the significant volume of commercial pcs that hp sells through these channels in addition to commercial channel relationships the volume direct organization which is charged with the management of direct sales for volume products is hosted within psg in addition psg manages direct online sales through the consumer exchange and the small business exchange 

ipg manages hps overall consumerrelated sales and marketing activities including our annual consumer product launch for the backtoschool and holiday seasons ipg also manages consumer channel relationships with thirdparty retail locations for imaging and printing products as well as other consumer products including consumer pcs which provides for a bundled sale opportunity between pcs and ipg products 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain hpdesigned products thirdparty oems manufacture some products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we employ building products to order capabilities to maximize manufacturing efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software customization requirements of certain customers our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding 

periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations we are dependent upon intel as a supplier of processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors we also have a valued relationship with amd and we have continued to see solid acceptance of amd processors in the market during fiscal 2009 

like other participants in the high technology industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints of certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production on occasion we acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 64 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2009 came from outside the united states the substantial majority of our net revenue originating outside the united states was from customers other than foreign governments 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps foreign operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

we remain committed to innovation as a key element of hps culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where 

partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 28 billion in fiscal 2009 35 billion in fiscal 2008 and 36 billion in fiscal 2007 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2009 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 33000 patents which was slightly above the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary while we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments 

in addition to developing our patents we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the diversity of our products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales often are weaker in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may 

be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and availability of application software and our internet infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive

 item 1a risk factors 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

the competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our operations results and prospects could be harmed 

unlike many of our competitors we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin the 

markets in which we do business particularly the personal computer and printing markets are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for these products in addition competitors in some of the markets in which we compete with a greater presence in lowercost jurisdictions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with hps supplies business in addition other companies have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laserjet and inkjet products particularly in jurisdictions outside of the united states where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist hp expects competitive refill and remanufacturing and cloned cartridge activity to continue to pressure margins in ipg which in turn has a significant impact on hp margins and profitability overall 

if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

the process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations we must make longterm investments develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so at all or within a given products life cycle any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product could result in our not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions however we may have limited ability to control quality issues particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products our operating margins could be 

adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and difficulty managing inventory levels for example we have recently experienced reduced revenue from our product businesses due to slowing global economic growth declines in the availability of credit weakening consumer and business confidence increased unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures and other challenges currently affecting the global economy sustained uncertainty about current global economic conditions may result in our customers continuing to postpone spending which could adversely affect demand for our products and services economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin and expenses 

we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures inventory write downs and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts and components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets could lead to increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses other income and expense could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates hedging expenses and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe and the long lead times that are required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of 17 

whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers in particular our pc business relies heavily upon outsourced manufacturers oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings resulting in further costs and delays 

• oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin • contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions in the event that we become committed to purchase components or services for prices in excess of the current market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices and our gross margin could suffer in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may have risk of uncollectability in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide in the future to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers as described above our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel corporation to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our 18 

pcs workstations handheld computing devices and servers and some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults in addition all six of our worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown but our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster 

system security risks data protection breaches and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design 

or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our clients including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected in the past and in the future could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenues overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue in particular ipg and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our gross margin and profitability in addition our services business has contributed significantly to our revenue and operating profit in recent periods competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments and ess in particular have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation in the press or investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of cost cutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions or executive team • the announcement of new products services technological innovations or acquisitions by hp or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flow from operations changes in estimates by the investment community or guidance provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp common stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition following periods of volatility in a companys securities securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted if instituted against hp this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the technology and products we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive 

advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example in recent years individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies such as hp if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that the claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows could be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing against hp in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs multifunction devices and printers that they allege are copying devices under applicable laws other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices if imposed the total amount of the copyright levies would depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which may be affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving hp and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries which could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these potential copyright levies or similar fees and the ability of hp to recover such amounts through increased prices remain uncertain 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 64 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment • differing technology standards or customer requirements 22 

• import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

as approximately 64 of our sales are from countries outside of the united states other currencies particularly the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on hps results expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could have a material impact on our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates as a result we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities if our forecasts are incorrect in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margin and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue may suffer 

many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue may decline 

our revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be overlaps in the current products and services of hp and portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any 

of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer 

our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our it services business properly 

the size and significance of the it services portion of our business has increased in recent periods the risks that accompany that business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse affect on the profit margin of our it services business • some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business • some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable thirdparty the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business if we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations our revenue could suffer 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we are currently and in the future may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its 

accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a material reduction in expected revenue 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report in addition as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in hps tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition president obamas administration has recently announced proposals for a new us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate any of these changes could affect our profitability 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occur towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there will be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter other developments late in a quarter such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely 

impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to execute on our strategy for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected 

we have adopted an operating framework that includes a disciplined focus on operational efficiency as part of this framework we have adopted several initiatives including a multiyear program announced in 2006 to reduce real estate costs by consolidating several hundred hp real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites and a multiyear process of examining every function and every one of our businesses and functions in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost we have also implemented a workforce restructuring program in fiscal 2008 relating to our services business and a workforce restructuring program in fiscal 2009 relating to our product businesses 

our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions regarding the cost of consolidating real estate locations the amount of accelerated depreciation or asset impairment to be incurred when we vacate facilities or cease using equipment before the end of their respective lease term or asset life and the costs and timing of other activities in connection with these initiatives these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition there are significant risks associated with our workforce restructuring programs including potential delays in the implementation of those programs in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in order to be successful we must attract retain and motivate key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense the failure to hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations 

changes to our compensation and benefit programs could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

like other companies hp has implemented changes to its compensation programs intended to reduce fixed costs create a high performance culture at all levels and provide an opportunity for employees to earn significant rewards if hp delivers strong financial results these changes included reducing base pay for many employees lowering the cap on matching contributions under the hp 401k plan making the funding of the hp 401k plan matching contributions fully discretionary depending on quarterly business results and eliminating the purchase price discount for shares purchased under the hp share ownership plan all of which were announced in february 2009 hp also has reduced the total number of sharebased payment awards granted to employees and the number of employees who receive sharebased payment awards due to these changes in our compensation programs we may find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business moreover any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could limit our ability to grant sharebased payment awards to employees in the future 

terrorist acts conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to hp our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars including the ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multi national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses divest noncore businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees suppliers or other third parties in addition the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these transactions less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we fail to identify and complete 

successfully business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue gross margin and profitability 

integration issues are complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns • persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions for example in august 2008 we completed our acquisition of eds and we are in the process of integrating eds into our company the size of the acquisition of eds increases both the scope and consequence of ongoing integration risks we may not successfully address the integration challenges in a timely manner or at all and we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the eds acquisition if we fail to realize such anticipated benefits or synergies our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations these business combination and investment transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inprocess research and development charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans moreover hp has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges 

relating to the impairment of those assets in order to complete an acquisition we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders in addition we may borrow to finance an acquisition and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition and potentially our credit ratings any potential future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and cost of borrowing and result in more restrictive borrowing terms in addition hps effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate we also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close as a result any completed pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter 

unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products and product takeback legislation we could incur substantial costs our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims and clean up costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which hp could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to hps directors and officers • specifying that hp stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by hp stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors • requiring a vote by the holders of twothirds of hps outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to hp stockholder meetings the board of directors and indemnification and • controlling the procedures for conduct of hp board and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of hp directors 30 

these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation hp also is subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of hps outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp common stock

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of products technologies software solutions and services to individual consumers small and mediumsized businesses and large enterprises including customers in the government health and education sectors our offerings span 

• multivendor customer services including infrastructure technology and business process outsourcing technology support and maintenance application development and support services and consulting and integration services • enterprise information technology infrastructure including enterprise storage and server technology networking products and resources and software that optimizes business technology investments • personal computing and other access devices and • imaging and printingrelated products and services we have seven business segments for financial reporting purposes services enterprise storage and servers ess hp software the personal systems group psg the imaging and printing group ipg hp financial services hpfs and corporate investments services ess and hp software are reported collectively as a broader hp enterprise business formerly referred to as the technology solutions group while the hp enterprise business is not an operating segment we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within it in order to provide a supplementary view of our business 

our strategy and operations are currently focused on the following initiatives 

competitive positioning 

we are positioning our businesses to take advantage of important trends in the markets for our products and services for example we are aligning our printing business to capitalize on key market trends such as the shift from analog to digital printing and the growth in printable content by developing innovative products for consumers such as the first webconnected home printer working to enable web and mobile printing expanding our presence in highusage annuity businesses including graphics and retail photo printing and growing our managed print services business we are also positioning our enterprise business to capitalize on the trend towards converged infrastructure products that integrate storage networking servers and management software in addition we have developed it management software offerings that seek to satisfy the increasing demand for virtualization management and increased automation 

driving operational efficiency 

we have implemented an ongoing program to optimize efficiency and reduce cost across the company as part of those efforts we are continuing to execute on our multiyear program to consolidate real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites in order to reduce our it spending and 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

real estate costs in addition we are continuing to implement the restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 to optimize the cost structure of our services business and the restructuring plan announced in may 2009 to structurally change and improve the effectiveness of several of our product businesses see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of these restructuring plans and the associated restructuring charges 

we also took actions in fiscal 2009 to further improve our cost structure and further shift our employee compensation structure from fixed to variable as part of those actions we reduced base pay for many of our employees we reduced the matching contributions under the hp 401k plan for all us employees and began funding these matching contributions quarterly on a discretionary basis based on our financial performance and we modified our employee stock purchase plan to eliminate the discount applicable to purchases made under the plan we are continuing to evaluate our businesses and market conditions and may consider additional restructuring or other actions in future periods 

investing for growth 

we are investing some of the savings derived from our efficiency initiatives for growth for example we are increasing our sales coverage to expand the size of the market that we cover including expanding into emerging markets such as china india and brazil we are creating innovative new products and developing new channels to connect with our customers particularly in our pc business in addition we are expanding our portfolio of products and services that we can offer to our customers both through acquisitions and through organic growth a critical component of this strategy was our acquisition of electronic data systems corporation eds in august 2008 which has increased the size and breadth of our services business and enabled us to provide comprehensive it product and services solutions to our customers 

in november 2009 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 3com corporation a global enterprise provider of networking switching routing and security solutions at a price of 790 per share in cash or an enterprise value of approximately 27 billion the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of 3coms stockholders the transaction is expected to close in our second fiscal quarter of 2010 

leveraging our portfolio and scale 

we now offer one of the it industrys broadest portfolios of products and services and we are working to leverage that portfolio as a strategic advantage for example in our enterprise business we are able to provide servers storage and networking packaged with services that can be delivered to customers in the manner of their choosing be it inhouse outsourced or as a service via the internet our portfolio of management software completes the package by allowing our customers to manage their it operations in an efficient and costeffective manner in addition we are working to optimize our supply chain by eliminating complexity reducing fixed costs and leveraging our scale to ensure the availability of components at favorable prices even during shortages we are also expanding our use of industry standard components in our enterprise products to further leverage our scale 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the following provides an overview of our key fiscal 2009 financial metrics and demonstrates how our execution of these initiatives has translated into financial performance 



cash and cash equivalents at october 31 2009 totaled 133 billion an increase of 31 billion from the october 31 2008 balance of 102 billion the increase for fiscal 2009 was due primarily to 134 billion of cash provided from operations and 18 billion of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans which were partially offset by 51 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock 32 billion net investment in property plant and equipment and 28 billion net payment of our debt 

we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone value uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 

we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract we record changes in revenue to income as a result of revisions to cost estimates in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

we recognize revenue on certain design and build design development andor construction of software andor systems projects using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

asu 200913 the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

concurrently to issuing asu 200913 the fasb also issued asu no 200914 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 200914 asu 200914 excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible products functionality 

hp early adopted the provisions of asu 200913 and asu 200914 as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 for new and materially modified deals originating after november 1 2008 therefore the previously reported quarterly results have been restated to reflect the impact of adoption 

we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers the best estimate of selling price is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles when determining our best estimate of selling price we apply management judgment when establishing margin objectives and pricing strategies and evaluating market conditions and product lifecycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future as these gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe and esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

the adoption of asu 200913 and asu 200914 was not material to our financial results increasing net revenues and net earnings by 255 million and 55 million respectively for fiscal 2009 the primary driver of the impact was the number of new or materially modified deals particularly impacting the second half of the fiscal year which was driven by economic and customerspecific factors an additional driver of the impact was the extent of hardware or shorterterm service projects sold into longerterm complex service arrangements in a particular quarter which may vary significantly on a dealbydeal basis we are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified deals in any given period 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill we engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the significant 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer contracts and lists developed and core technology and the compaq trade name the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in detail in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts customer lists distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed compaq brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

restructuring 

we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs if the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in the results of operations section and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards net of an estimated forfeiture rate we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards requires subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility we utilize the blackscholes option pricing model to value the stock options granted under our principal option plans to implement this model we examined our historical pattern of option exercises to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations from this analysis we identified three employee populations to which to apply the blackscholes model we determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hp common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility therefore expected volatility used in the blackscholes option pricing model in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 was based on marketbased implied volatility 

we issue performancebased restricted units prus representing hypothetical shares of hp common stock each pru award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient we determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a threeyear performance period based on results achieved versus goals based on our annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and average total shareholder return tsr relative to the sp 500 over the performance period we use historic volatility for pru awards as implied volatility 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

cannot be used when simulating multivariate prices for companies in the sp 500 we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation model as the tsr modifier contains a market condition we update the estimated expense net of forfeitures for the cashflow performance against the goal for that year at the end of each reporting period 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions respectively 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2022 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and over sixty foreign countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained however our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our reserve for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest we review our reserves quarterly and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations or new case law previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices execution of advanced pricing agreements resolution with respect to individual audit issues the resolution of entire audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors including the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors the financial condition of customers the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions significant onetime events and historical experience also we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if circumstances related to customers change we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward the annual general provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 006 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2009 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately 36 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2009 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand rapid technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates

valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the provisions of accounting standards codification topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference we also compare the fair value of purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives to their carrying value we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 did not result in an impairment charge the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of hps reporting units as of august 1 2009 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 750 million to approximately 35 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately 550 million to approximately 31 billion for each of hps reporting units 

fair value of financial instruments 

we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available which may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections financial instruments are primarily comprised of time deposits money market funds commercial paper corporate and other debt securities equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents and derivative instruments 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we measure fair value using the framework established by the fasb accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures this framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 

the valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs require management to make certain assumptions and judgments based on the best information available observable inputs are the preferred source of values these two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy 

level 1—quoted prices unadjusted for identical instruments in active markets 

level 2—quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 

level 3—prices or valuations that require management inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 

a description of the valuation methodologies we use to measure our financial assets and liabilities at fair value is provided below 

cash equivalents and investments we hold time deposits money market funds commercial paper other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds and common stock and equivalents in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly if quoted prices for identical or similar assets are not available we use internally developed valuation models whose inputs include bid prices and third party valuations utilizing underlying asset assumptions 

derivative instruments as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we mainly hold nonspeculative forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures when active market quotes are not available we use industry standard valuation models where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves credit risk foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies in certain cases marketbased observable inputs are not available and in those cases we use management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value 

warranty provision 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms ongoing product failure rates repair costs product 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

call rates average cost per call and current period product shipments if actual product failure rates repair rates or any other post sales support costs were to differ from our estimates we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 35 of annual net product revenue while actual annual warranty costs have averaged approximately 33 of annual net product revenue 

retirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates salary growth longterm return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the salary growth assumptions reflect our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook longterm return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and managements expectation of the future economic environment as well as target asset allocations 

in the beginning of fiscal 2008 we implemented a liabilitydriven investment strategy for the hp us defined benefit pension plan which was frozen effective december 31 2007 as part of the strategy we transitioned our investment allocation for that plan to predominantly fixed income assets in fiscal 2008 we acquired eds the eds us defined benefit plan assets were invested predominantly in public equity and alternative investments at the end of fiscal 2009 the assets of the hp and eds plans were merged resulting in a portfolio with a blend of fixed income equities and alternatives the expected return on the plan assets used in calculating the net benefit cost is 799 for fiscal 2010 which reflects the target asset allocation of the merged portfolio 

our medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics and in general changes if any have moved in the same direction over the last several years for fiscal 2009 changes in the weightedaverage rates for the hp benefit plans would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost 

• a decrease of 25 basis points in the longterm rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 43 million • a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 71 million and • an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 15 million loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to fair value measurements the new standard defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb issued a new provision which delayed the effective date of the fair value measurements and disclosures for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually in august 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200905 measuring liabilities at fair value in relation to the fair value measurement of liabilities we adopted the applicable portions of the provisions of the new standards in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and will adopt the provision related to the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 although we will continue to evaluate the application of the provision for the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information pertaining to fair value measurements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to business combinations the new standard expands the definition of a business and a business combination requires recognition of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognized in earnings requires acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred requires inprocess research and development to be capitalized at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset and requires that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes the new standard also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination in april 2009 the fasb issued a new standard which clarified the accounting for preacquisition contingencies we will adopt these new business combination standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of the business combinations completed after the adoption of this statement 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to noncontrolling interests the new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated the new standard also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in may 2008 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to convertible debt instruments the new standard requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate we will adopt this new accounting standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that clarifies whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions should be included in computing earnings per share under the new standard we will be required to include restricted stock that contains nonforfeitable rights to dividends in our calculation of basic earnings per share eps and will need to calculate basic eps using the twoclass method the twoclass method of computing eps is an earnings allocation formula that determines eps for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings we will adopt this new accounting standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our calculation of basic eps 

in november 2008 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to defensive intangible assets defensive intangible assets are acquired intangible assets that the acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them under the new standard defensive intangible assets must be initially recognized at fair value and amortized over the benefit period we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of business combinations completed after the date of adoption 

in december 2008 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that requires additional disclosures about assets held in an employers defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we will present the required disclosures in the prescribed format on a prospective basis upon adoption this new standard will only affect the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to transfers of financial assets it amends previous guidance to remove the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity and its exemption from consolidation in the transferors financial statements this new standard also establishes conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale modifies the financialasset derecognition criteria revises how interests retained by the transferor in a sale of financial assets are initially measured removes the guaranteed mortgage securitization recharacterization provisions and requires additional disclosures we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities it eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity this new standard also requires additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles which only affected the specific references to gaap literature in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu 200913 the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price concurrently to issuing asu 200913 the fasb also issued asu 200914 asu 200914 excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible products functionality

net revenue 

the components of the weighted net revenue change from the prioryear period were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2009 the global slowdown of it and consumer spending impacted each of our segments net revenue decreased 32 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 increased 13 on a constant currency basis the unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro for fiscal 2009 the services segment contributed favorably to the total hp net revenue change primarily as a result of the eds acquisition us net revenue increased 12 to 413 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 10 to 732 billion the increase in us net revenue in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily a result of the acquisition of eds 

the psg net revenue decline in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of the overall slowdown in the global economy psg average selling prices asps declined in both consumer clients and commercial clients the asp decline in fiscal 2009 was offset slightly by an increase in the option and monitor attach rates psg unit volumes however increased slightly in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

ipg experienced net revenue declines in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 in the commercial and consumer hardware business units and in the supplies business unit unit volume declines across each of the business units were a result of the softness in both the business and consumer demand environments 

ess net revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 driven by declines in our industry standard servers iss business critical systems and storage business units the revenue declines were due primarily to the economic slowdown and overall weak demand environment iss unit volumes and average unit prices declined in fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior year 

hp software experienced net revenue declines in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 in both the business technology optimization bto business unit and the other software business unit due primarily to revenue declines in licenses and services the effect of which was partially offset by increased support revenue as a result of renewal rate increases 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

net revenue in corporate investments and other declined in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 resulting from lower sales of network infrastructure products primarily as a result of the slowdown in the networking market 

hpfs net revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to unfavorable currency movements 

the net revenue increase in services in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due primarily to net revenue increases in infrastructure technology outsourcing application services and business process outsourcing primarily as a result of the eds acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the effect of which was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and a decline in spending from existing customers net revenue in technology services declined in fiscal 2009 due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and weak economic conditions the effect of which was partially offset by growth in extended warranty 

fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2008 hp net revenue increased approximately 135 from the prioryear period 84 on a constant currency basis the favorable currency impact for fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro us net revenue was 369 billion for fiscal 2008 an increase of 6 from the prior year while international net revenue increased 17 to 814 billion 

psg net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 as a result of a unit volume increase of 22 the unit volume increase was the result of strong growth in notebooks with continued strength in emerging markets the positive revenue impact from this unit volume increase was moderated by declines in asps in commercial and consumer clients of 7 and 4 respectively 

ipg net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 due to the growth in supplies net revenue as a result of higher unit volumes with strong performance from colorrelated products for fiscal 2008 commercial hardware net revenues increased slightly while consumer hardware net revenues declined due primarily to competitive pricing pressures and a slowing economy

gross margin 

the gross margin table below identifies each segments weighted contribution to the change in the total company gross margin from the corresponding prior year the segment contribution components of the gross margin decline as compared to the prioryear periods were as follows 



fiscal 2009 

total company gross margin decreased by 06 percentage points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 from a segment perspective and on a weighted basis ess had the largest impact to the total company gross margin decline due to mix and rate declines 

ess gross margin decreased in fiscal 2009 from the prior year due primarily to competitive pricing across each of the segment business units and product mix shifts 

the gross margin in our services segment increased for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvements including delivery efficiencies and cost controls in our technology services business and edsrelated acquisition synergies this was partially offset by the mix effect from the acquisition of the eds business which has lower gross margins 

the increase in hp software gross margin in fiscal 2009 from the prior year resulted primarily from a favorable support and services revenue mix and improved services margins the effect of which was partially offset by an unfavorable license revenue mix 

the hpfs gross margin decline in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was driven by unfavorable currency impacts lower margins relating to endoflease activities higher bad debt expenses and lower margins for remarketing and buyout activities the effect of which was partially offset by higher portfolio margins 

gross margin in corporate investments and other declined for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 as a result of a unit volume decline in the sale of network infrastructure products and competitive pricing pressures 

the improvement in ipg gross margin in fiscal 2009 from the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in the supplies mix and supplies pricing the effect of which was partially offset by hardware margin declines 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

psg had the most favorable impact to the change in total company gross margin due to the mix effect of its gross margin representing a smaller component of our total gross margin from levels experienced in the prioryear period 

psg gross margin declined in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 resulting from asps declining at a faster pace than component costs combined with a mix shift towards lowerend products the effects of which were partially offset by lower warranty and supply chain costs and improvements in the option attach rate 

fiscal 2008 

total company gross margin decreased slightly in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 on a segment basis an increase in hp software gross margin and a small increase in ess gross margin were offset by small gross margin declines in services and hpfs and flat gross margin growth across our remaining segments 

the slight improvement in ess gross margin in fiscal 2008 from the prior year was primarily a result of improved cost management and attach rates in industry standard servers 

services gross margin declined in fiscal 2008 from the prior year due primarily to the impact from the continued competitive pricing environment partially offset by the continued focus on cost structure improvements generated by delivery efficiencies and cost controls 

for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the improvement in hp software gross margin was primarily the result of cost savings in the bto business unit 

hpfs gross margin declined slightly in fiscal 2008 due primarily to higher bad debt expenses the effect of which was partially offset by increased margins on endoflease activity 

ipg gross margin remained flat in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 with improved supplies margins resulting from mix shifts being offset by unfavorable hardware margins 

in fiscal 2008 psg gross margin remained flat due primarily to declining asps offset by an increase in the attach rate of highermargin options 

operating expenses 

research and development 

total research and development rd expense decreased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due primarily to favorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro as well as effective cost controls the effect of which was partially offset by additional expenses related primarily to services in fiscal 2009 rd expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased for ess psg and ipg and increased for hp software services and corporate investments 

total rd decreased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to effective cost controls the impact of which was partially offset by the unfavorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro each of our major segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in rd expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative sga expense decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to favorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro lower compensation expense as well as effective cost management the impact of which was partially offset by additional expenses related to the eds acquisition in fiscal 2009 sga expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased for each of our segments except for corporate investments 

total sga expense increased in fiscal 2008 due primarily to higher field selling costs as a result of our investments in sales resources unfavorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro and additional expenses related to the eds acquisition each of our major segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2008

acquisitionrelated charges 

we recorded acquisitionrelated charges of 242 million and 41 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively related primarily to consulting and integration costs as well as retention bonuses associated with the eds acquisition the increase in the acquisitionrelated charges in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to our acquisition of eds in august 2008 

pension curtailments and pension settlements net 

in fiscal 2007 we recognized a net gain on pension curtailments and settlements of 517 million relating primarily to a 542 million curtailment gain associated with a modification to our us defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan this curtailment gain was offset partially by net settlement losses related to our other pension plan design changes 

for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

interest and other net 

interest and other net decreased by 721 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease was driven primarily by higher interest expenses due to higher average debt balances principally related to the eds acquisition lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates and higher currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement items additionally there were higher gains from the sale of real estate in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2009 

interest and other net decreased by 458 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease resulted primarily from currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement items and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates the effect of which was partially offset by lower interest expense additionally the prioryear period benefited from higher gains from the sale of real estate 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 186 205 and 208 in fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively hps effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with some earnings from hps operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world hp has not provided us taxes for all of such earnings because hp plans to reinvest some of those earnings indefinitely outside the united states 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the net income tax benefits recorded for fiscal 2009 which were related to foreign net operating losses adjustments to estimated fiscal 2008 tax accruals upon filing the 2008 income tax returns valuation allowance reversals for state and foreign net operating losses and other miscellaneous items 

the decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was related in part to lower tax rates in other jurisdictions

hpfs net revenue increased by 155 in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 the net revenue increase was due primarily to a shift towards operating leases from financing leases in the overall portfolio asset mix higher average portfolio assets during the year higher endoflease activity and a favorable currency impact

hpfs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 05 percentage points in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue and increased margin on endof lease activity the effect of which was offset by higher bad debt expenses and lower portfolio margins due to higher operating leases in the portfolio asset mix the operating expense decrease as a percentage of revenue is driven by a higher rate of increase in revenues relative to operating expenses due to higher operating lease mix of the portfolio and continued cost controls 

financing originations 



new financing originations which represent the amounts of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services and include intercompany activity increased 69 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 and 97 in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 the increases reflect higher financing associated with hp product sales and services offerings resulting from improved integration and engagement with hps sales efforts offset by unfavorable currency impact 

portfolio assets and ratios 

hpfs maintains a strategy to generate a competitive return on equity by effectively leveraging its portfolio against the risks associated with interest rates and credit the hpfs business model is assetintensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company however certain intercompany loans and accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 

the portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for hpfs were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



1 portfolio assets include gross financing receivables of approximately 61 billion and 51 billion at october 31 2009 and october 31 2008 and net equipment under operating leases of 22 billion and 18 billion at october 31 2009 and october 31 2008 as disclosed in note 11 to the

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference portfolio assets also include capitalized profit on intercompany equipment transactions of approximately 700 million at october 31 2009 and october 31 2008 and intercompany leases of approximately 10 billion and 800 million at october 31 2009 and october 31 2008 both of which are eliminated in consolidation 

2 allowance for doubtful accounts includes both the shortterm and the longterm portions of the allowance on financing receivables 3 hpfs debt consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes intercompany debt and debt issued directly by hpfs 

net portfolio assets at october 31 2009 increased 208 from october 31 2008 the increase resulted from higher levels of financing originations in fiscal 2009 and a favorable currency impact the overall percentage of portfolio assets reserves remained flat due to continued strong portfolio performance hpfs funds its operations mainly through a combination of intercompany debt and equity in addition to the balances reflected above hp assumed net portfolio assets of 51 million through the acquisition of eds

corporate investments 



net revenue in corporate investments relates primarily to network infrastructure products sold under the brand procurve networking in fiscal 2009 revenue from network infrastructure products decreased 196 as compared to fiscal 2008 resulting from the slowdown in the networking market and a resulting decrease in sales of enterprise ethernet switch products partially offsetting the revenue decline was revenue resulting from the acquisition of colubris networks inc colubris which hp acquired in october 2008 

corporate investments reported a loss from operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to the positive earnings from operations reported in fiscal 2008 due primarily to lower earnings from operations generated by network infrastructure products gross margin in corporate investments declined for fiscal 2009 as the result of a unit volume decline in the sale of network infrastructure products and

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

competitive pricing pressure the loss from operations in corporate investments was also impacted by expenses carried in the segment associated with corporate development global alliances and hp labs which declined from fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2008 the majority of the net revenue in corporate investments related to network infrastructure products sold under the brand procurve networking which grew 262 from fiscal 2007 as the result of continued increased sales of enterprise class gigabit and 10 gigabit ethernet switch products fiscal 2008 network infrastructure revenue included a small amount of revenue from colubris 

corporate investments reported earnings from operations in fiscal 2008 as compared to losses in fiscal 2007 due primarily to increased earnings from operations generated by network infrastructure products and operating expenses related to hp labs was flat as compared to fiscal 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws we have provided for the united states federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states repatriation could result in additional united states federal income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

the information discussed below is presented based on our historical results which include the results of eds for the period following the august 26 2008 closing date of the acquisition 

liquidity 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support business operations capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to a level of discretionary investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this nearterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

institutions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the market risks identified in the section entitled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a 



1 in addition to these available borrowing resources we are able to offer for sale from time to time in one or more offerings an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants under the 2009 shelf registration statement 

our cash position remains strong and we believe our cash balances are sufficient to cover cash outlays expected in fiscal 2010 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics from our consolidated statements of cash flow 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 12 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease was due primarily to increased utilization of cash resources for payment of operating liabilities such as accounts payable other current liabilities and restructuring along with a decrease in net earnings the impact of which was partially offset by the increased generation of cash resources through the utilization of operating assets such as inventory and other current assets along with increased amortization expense net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 50 billion for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase was due primarily to higher net earnings in fiscal 2008 a decrease in accounts and financing receivables and increased accounts payable 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our key working capital metrics are as follows 



1 beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we reclassified certain activity within other accrued liabilities to accounts payable as this better represents the nature of the activity all prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation 

days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average net revenue our accounts receivable balance was 134 billion as of october 31 2007 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average cost of goods sold our inventory balance was 80 billion as of october 31 2007 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold our accounts payable balance was 124 billion as of october 31 2007 

our working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo 

the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2009 decreased by 6 days as compared to fiscal 2008 the increase in dso was due primarily to our improving penetration into the enterprise market which tends to have a higher dso profile optimizing terms to drive shareholder value as well as more sales in the month of october the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory levels driven primarily by improved inventory management the increase in dpo was due primarily to a change in purchasing linearity in the fourth quarter 

the cash conversion cycle for the fiscal 2008 decreased by 4 days as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in dso was due primarily to a higher accounts receivable balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the same period in fiscal 2007 and the effect of the eds acquisition the decrease in dos was due primarily to more efficient inventory management higher cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of increased revenues and the effect of the eds acquisition the slight decrease in dpo was due to the effect of the eds acquisition 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately 101 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due primarily to higher cash payments made in connection with fiscal 2008 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

acquisitions and increased by approximately 46 billion for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to fiscal 2008 acquisition activity 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately 47 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was due primarily to higher net repayments of commercial paper and debt the impact of which was partially offset by decreased repurchases of our common stock net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 36 billion for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease was due primarily to higher net issuance of commercial paper and debt

capital resources 

debt levels 



we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities overall cost of capital and targeted capital structure 

in fiscal 2009 shortterm debt decreased by 83 billion and longterm debt increased by 63 billion as compared to fiscal 2008 this was primarily due to the replacement of shortterm debt with longterm debt as capital market conditions improved from last year which was partially offset by a reclassification of 1 billion from longterm to shortterm shortterm debt and longterm debt increased by 70 billion and 27 billion respectively for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the net increase in total debt is due mainly to commercial paper issued in conjunction with the eds acquisition 

our debtequity ratio is calculated as the carrying value of debt divided by the carrying value of equity our debtequity ratio decreased by 007x in fiscal 2009 due primarily to the net repayment of 20 billion debt it increased by 025x in fiscal 2008 due primarily to funding the eds acquisition by debt 

our weightedaverage interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the year it factors in the impact of swapping some of our global notes with fixed interest rates for global notes with floating interest rates for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the slightly lower weighted average interest rates over the past three years is a result of the combination of lower market interest rates and swapping some of our fixed interest obligations

associated with some of our fixed global notes for variable rate obligations through interest rate swaps in a declining rates environment 

for more information on our borrowings see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

available borrowing resources 

at october 31 2009 we had the following resources available to obtain shortterm or longterm financings if we need additional liquidity 



1 in may 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement the 2009 shelf registration statement with the sec to enable us to offer for sale from time to time and as the capital markets permit in one or more offerings an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants 2 our commercial paper programs are supported by various credit facilities including a 35 billion credit facility expiring in february 2010 and a 29 billion credit facility expiring in may 2012 our ability to have a us commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the 64 billion supported by our credit facilities is subject to a number of factors including liquidity conditions and business performance hp also has registered for the commercial paper funding facility cpff provided by the federal reserve bank of new york which would enable hp to issue threemonth unsecured commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle of the federal reserve the maximum amount of commercial paper that hp may issue at any time through this program is 104 billion less the total principal amount of all other outstanding commercial paper that hp has issued the cpff program is currently scheduled to expire on february 1 2010 as of october 31 2009 hp had not issued any commercial paper under the cpff program see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information about these credit facilities and the cpff program 3 hp maintains uncommitted lines of credit from a number of financial institutions that are available through various foreign subsidiaries 4 we have revolving trade receivablesbased facilities permitting us to sell certain trade receivables to third parties on a nonrecourse basis the aggregate maximum capacity under these programs was 568 million as of october 31 2009 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

credit ratings 

our credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them the ratings for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 were 



we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt however a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities also a downgrade in our credit rating could limit our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs if this occurs we would seek alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of notes under our existing shelf registration statements 

contractual and other obligations 

the impact that we expect our contractual and other obligations as of october 31 2009 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 amounts represent the expected principal cash payments relating to our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts and premiums 2 amounts represent the expected interest cash payments relating to our longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with some of our fixed global notes for variable rate obligations the impact of these interest rate swaps was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in addition to the above at october 31 2009 we had approximately 13 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertainty in income tax positions which will be partially offset by 58 million of deferred tax assets and interest receivable these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 19 million expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on taxes 

funding commitments 

in fiscal 2010 we expect to contribute approximately 820 million to our pension and postretirement plan funding our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities funding for the years following 2010 would be based on the then current market conditions actuarial estimates and plan funding status see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on pension activity 

as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect future cash expenditures of approximately 19 billion we expect to make cash payments of approximately 11 billion in fiscal 2010 and the majority of the remaining amount through 2012 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on restructuring activities 

guarantees and indemnifications

litigation and contingencies 

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information on liabilities that may arise from litigation and contingencies 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of october 31 2009 we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant to our operations for fiscal 2009 were the euro the japanese yen and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany lease loan denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures for these types of derivatives and hedges we recognize the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currencydenominated exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2009 and 2008 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2009 and 2008 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of 106 million and 141 million at october 31 2009 and october 31 2008 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then typically use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for 

floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2009 and 2008 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investment instruments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables the discount rates we used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2009 and 2008 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investment instruments and financing receivables net of interest rate swap positions of 33 million at october 31 2009 and 9 million at october 31 2008 

equity price risk 

we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities which had an estimated fair value of 5 million at october 31 2009 and 5 million at october 31 2008 we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis generally we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities however we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of 1 million at october 31 2009 and 2 million at october 31 2008 the aggregate cost of privatelyheld companies marketable trading securities and other investments was 142 million at october 31 2009 and 425 million at october 31 2008

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups and distribution is organized by direct and channel within the channel we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups the partners include 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups 7 

• distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships • independent distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no presence • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated products • independent software vendors isvs that provide their clients with specialized software products frequently driving sales of additional nonhp products and services and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products and • systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with hps to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services the mix of hps business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions necessitate sales marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly hp is focused on driving efficiencies and productivity gains in both the direct and indirect business 

tsg manages most of our enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also has primary responsibility for simplifying sales processes across our segments to improve speed and effectiveness of customer delivery in this capacity tsg manages our direct sales for both volume and value products including industry standard servers products unix® enterprise storage and software and presales technical consultants as well as our direct distribution activities for commercial products and gotomarket activities with systems integrators and isvs tsg also drives hps vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication media and entertainment financial services manufacturing and distribution and public sector industries 

psg manages smb customer relationships and commercial reseller channels due largely to the significant volume of commercial pcs that hp sells through these channels in addition to commercial channel relationships the volume direct organization which is charged with the management of direct sales for volume products is hosted within psg in addition psg manages direct consumer sales online through hp home  home office 

ipg manages hps overall consumerrelated sales and marketing activities including our annual consumer product launch for the backtoschool and holiday seasons ipg also manages consumer channel relationships with thirdparty retail locations for imaging and printing products as well as other consumer products including consumer pcs which provides for a bundled sale opportunity between pcs and ipg products 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a number of contract manufacturers cms and original design manufacturers odms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of cms and odms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain hpdesigned products thirdparty oems manufacture some products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of cms and odms we currently manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we employ building products to order capabilities to maximize manufacturing efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software customization requirements of certain customers our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations we are dependent upon intel as a supplier of processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors we also have a valued relationship with amd and we have continued to see solid acceptance of amd processors in the market during fiscal 2008 

like other participants in the high technology industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints of certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production on occasion we acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 69 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2008 came from outside the united states the substantial majority of our net revenue originating outside the united states was from customers other than foreign governments 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps foreign operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

we remain committed to innovation as a key element of hps culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 35 billion in fiscal 2008 and 36 billion in fiscal 2007 and 2006 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2008 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 32000 patents which was slightly above the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary while we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments 

in addition to developing our patents we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the diversity of our products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales often are weaker in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and availability of application software and our internet infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

on a revenue basis we are the largest usbased company offering our range of general purpose computers and personal information imaging and printing products for industrial scientific business and consumer applications and it services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments

hp services our service businesses including eds compete in it support services consulting and integration infrastructure technology outsourcing business process outsourcing and application services the it support services and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as our customers have reduced their it budgets however this trend has benefited the outsourcing services business as customers drive toward lower it management costs to enable more strategic investments our competitors include ibm global services computer sciences corporation 

systems integration firms such as accenture ltd and offshore companies such as fujitsu and indiabased competitors wipro ltd infosys technologies ltd and tata consultancy services ltd we also compete with other traditional hardware providers such as dell which are increasingly offering services to support their products many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition our service businesses team with many companies to offer services and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities our competitive advantages are evident in our deep technology expertise which includes multivendor environments virtualization and automation our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources in sap oracle and microsoft platforms

hp financial services in our financing business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm global financing as well as banks and financial institutions we believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and financial institutions is our ability to finance products services and total solutions

 item 1a risk factors 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

the competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our operations results and prospects could be harmed 

unlike many of our competitors we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin the markets in which we do business particularly the personal computer and printing markets are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for these products in addition competitors in some of the markets in which we compete with a greater presence in lowercost jurisdictions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with hps supplies business in addition other companies have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laserjet and inkjet products particularly in jurisdictions outside of the united states where adequate intellectual property 

protection may not exist hp expects competitive refill and remanufacturing and cloned cartridge activity to continue to pressure margins in ipg which in turn has a significant impact on hp margins and profitability overall 

if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

the process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations we must make longterm investments develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at all or within a given products life cycle any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product could result in our not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions however we may have limited ability to control quality issues particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products our operating margins could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue may suffer 

many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue may decline 

our revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be 

overlaps in the current products and services of hp and portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the technology and products we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example in recent years individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies such as hp if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that the claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows could be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing against hp in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs multifunction devices and printers that they allege are copying devices under applicable laws other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies 

on these types of devices if imposed the total amount of the copyright levies would depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which may be affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving hp and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries but which could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these potential copyright levies or similar fees and the ability of hp to recover such amounts through increased prices remain uncertain 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and constrained it spending has resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables we have experienced and may experience in the future reduced spending in our consumer and financial services businesses due to the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets access to credit and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior in addition customer financial difficulties have resulted and could result in the future in increases in bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables portfolio inability by our lessees to make required lease payments and reduction in the value of leased equipment upon its return to us compared to the value estimated at lease inception in particular our exposure to certain industries currently experiencing financial difficulties including the us automobile industry and certain financially troubled customers could have an adverse affect on our results of operations we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures inventory writedowns charges associated with the cancellation of planned production line expansion increases in pension and postretirement benefit expenses and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations prospects and stock price 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 69 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations 19 

• managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

as approximately 69 of our sales are from countries outside of the united states other currencies particularly the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on hps results expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could have a material impact on our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

terrorist acts conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to hp our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars including the ongoing military operations in iraq have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply 

chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults in addition all six of our worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown but our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margin and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in 

enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe and the long lead times that are required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain supplies as a result of strong demand capacity constraints and supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of which are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers in particular our pc business relies heavily upon cms and odms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those cms and odms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these cms and odms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular cm or odm could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the cm or odm and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that cm or odm if shortages or delays persist the price of these supplies may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the supplies may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough supplies at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings resulting in further costs and delays • oversupply in order to secure supplies for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase supplies strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future supplies if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin • contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase supplies or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions in the event that we become committed to purchase supplies or services for prices in excess of the 22 

current market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices and our gross margin could suffer in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same cms odms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain cms odms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its cms and odms may create large supplier receivables with the cms and odms that depending on the financial condition of the cms and odms may have risk of uncollectability in addition certain of our cms odms and suppliers may decide in the future to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors cms odms or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers as described above our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations handheld computing devices and servers and some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of supplies to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our it services business properly 

as a result of our acquisition of eds in august 2008 we have significantly increased the size of the it services portion of our business the risks that accompany that business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following 

• the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected 23 

costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse affect on the profit margin of our it services business 

• some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases • some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable thirdparty the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services that could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business if we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations our revenue could suffer 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we are currently and in the future may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a material reduction in expected revenue 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue in particular ipg and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our gross margin and profitability competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting ipg therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments and ess in particular have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product 

portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report in addition as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates under the provisions of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in hps tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states any of these changes could affect our profitability 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occur towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there will be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter other developments late in a quarter such as a systems failure 

component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to execute on our strategy for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected 

we have adopted an operating framework that includes a disciplined focus on operational efficiency as part of this framework we have adopted several initiatives including 

• a multiyear plan announced in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 to consolidate hps 85 data centers worldwide into six larger centers located in three us cities and transform our it infrastructure to improve operational efficiency and workforce effectiveness and significantly reduce our it spending • a multiyear program announced in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 to reduce real estate costs by consolidating several hundred hp real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites and • a multiyear process of examining every function and every one of our businesses and functions in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions regarding the cost of consolidating the data centers and real estate locations the amount of accelerated depreciation or asset impairment to be incurred when we vacate facilities or cease using equipment before the end of their respective lease term or asset life and the costs and timing of other activities in connection with these initiatives these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition in september 2008 we announced a workforce restructuring program relating to our acquisition of eds we expect that program to involve the elimination of approximately 24700 positions worldwide through fiscal 2012 we expect to replace approximately half of these positions in locations that will optimize our global footprint significant risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia delays in hiring and integrating new employees decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees 

in order to be successful we must attract retain and motivate key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense the failure to hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations 

changes to our compensation and benefit programs could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have historically used stock options and other forms of sharebased payment awards as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages like other companies hp has implemented changes to its compensation programs intended to reduce fixed costs create a high performance culture at all levels and provide an opportunity for employees to earn significant rewards if hp delivers strong financial results hp also has reduced the total number of sharebased payment awards granted to employees and the number of employees who receive sharebased payment awards in addition effective in fiscal 2008 hp changed its primary form of sharebased payment award to performancebased restricted stock units that contain conditions relating to hps longterm financial performance and continued employment by the recipient that may be viewed unfavorably by some employees who are accustomed to the fixed vesting and other terms historically associated with other forms of sharebased payment awards due to these changes in our compensation strategy combined with the pension and other benefit plan changes undertaken to reduce costs we may find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business moreover difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it harder or more expensive for us to grant sharebased payment awards to employees in the future 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation in the press or investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of cost cutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions or executive team • the announcement of new products services technological innovations or acquisitions by hp or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flow from operations changes in estimates by the investment community or guidance provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp 27 

general or industryspecific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp common stock in particular the stock market as a whole recently has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to those companies operating performance for these reasons investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition following periods of volatility in a companys securities securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted if instituted against hp this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

system security risks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability for us and damage to the companys brand and reputation accordingly we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data including our current project to consolidate all of our worldwide it data centers into six centers which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected in the past and in the future could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses divest noncore businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully 

complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees suppliers or other third parties in addition the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these transactions less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we fail to identify and complete successfully business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue gross margin and profitability 

integration issues are complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns • persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions for example in august 2008 we completed our acquisition of eds and we are in the process of integrating eds into our company the size of the acquisition of eds increases both the scope and consequence of ongoing integration risks we may not successfully address the integration challenges in a timely manner or at all and we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the eds acquisition if we fail to realize such anticipated benefits or synergies our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations these business combination 

and investment transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inprocess research and development charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans moreover hp has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets in order to complete an acquisition we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders in addition we may borrow to finance an acquisition including borrowing to replace the shortterm borrowings used to finance our recently completed acquisition of eds although our current credit ratings have been affirmed by the three independent rating agencies taking into account the borrowing relating to the eds acquisition the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition and potentially our credit ratings any potential future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and cost of borrowing and result in more restrictive borrowing terms in addition hps effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate we also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close as a result any completed pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter 

unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products and product takeback legislation we could incur substantial costs our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims and clean up costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which hp could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to hps directors and officers • specifying that hp stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by hp stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors • requiring a vote by the holders of twothirds of hps outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to hp stockholder meetings the board of directors and indemnification and • controlling the procedures for conduct of hp board and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of hp directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation hp also is subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of hps outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp common stock

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of products technologies software solutions and services to individual consumers small and mediumsized businesses smbs and large enterprises including customers in the public and education sectors our offerings span 

• personal computing and other access devices • imaging and printingrelated products and services • enterprise information technology infrastructure including enterprise storage and server technology and software that optimizes business technology investments and • multivendor customer services including technology support and maintenance consulting and integration and outsourcing services we have seven business segments for financial reporting purposes enterprise storage and servers ess hp services hps hp software the personal systems group psg the imaging and printing group ipg hp financial services hpfs and corporate investments ess hps and hp software are reported collectively as a broader technology solutions group tsg while tsg is not an operating segment we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within tsg in order to provide a supplementary view of our business 

the operating framework within which we manage our businesses and which guides our strategies is based on the disciplined management of three business levers targeted growth operational efficiency and strategic deployment of capital although we have made progress towards our goals in recent periods there are still many areas in which we believe that we can improve to implement this operating framework we are focused on the following initiatives 

• we are engaged in a process of examining every function and every business in the company in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost • we have substantially completed the consolidation of our 85 data centers worldwide in existence prior to our acquisition of electronic data systems corporation eds into six stateoftheart centers in three us cities • we are consolidating several hundred real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites in order to reduce our it spending and real estate costs • we are aligning our resources and reinvesting a portion of the cost savings from these initiatives to build our market share in emerging markets and to expand our sales coverage to drive growth in mature markets • we are developing training programs for our sales forces designed to enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers and build customer loyalty 37 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

• we are building and expanding our services organization which has been substantially augmented through our acquisition of eds to support our technology businesses and enable us to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers • we are developing a global delivery structure to take advantage of regions where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs and • we are repurchasing shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase shares opportunistically on august 26 2008 we completed our acquisition of eds a leading provider of information technology services for enterprise customers accordingly we have included the results of the business operations acquired from eds in our consolidated results of operations beginning on that date those business operations have been included as a business unit within hps for financial reporting purposes see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information about the eds acquisition 

we believe the general strategic benefits from the eds acquisition will both enhance our competitive position in a number of important industries by improving the breadth and depth of our service offerings and further increase our extensive experience in offering solutions to customers in the areas of government healthcare manufacturing financial services energy transportation communications and consumer industries and retail edss service offerings coupled with our existing service offerings provide broad capabilities in infrastructure technology outsourcing including data center services workplace services networking services and managed security business process outsourcing including health claims financial processing crm and hr outsourcing and applications outsourcing including development modernization and management 

in september 2008 we announced a restructuring plan to gain efficiencies following the eds acquisition the restructuring plan will be implemented over four years and includes a targeted reduction in headcount of approximately 24700 employees over that period with the majority of the reductions occurring by the end of fiscal 2009 our plan includes replacing roughly half of these positions in order to optimize our global footprint as part of this plan we recorded 18 billion in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 15 billion of which was booked to goodwill and 03 billion of which was recorded as a restructuring charge 

we continue to grow our business organically and through strategic acquisitions during fiscal 2008 we acquired nine companies the largest of which was eds and we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions periodically in the future

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in terms of how our execution has translated into financial performance the following provides an overview of our key fiscal 2008 financial metrics 



1 includes the results of the business operations acquired from eds beginning on august 26 2008 cash and cash equivalents at october 31 2008 totaled 102 billion a decrease of 11 billion from the october 31 2007 balance of 113 billion the decrease for fiscal 2008 was related primarily to 112 billion of net cash paid for business acquisitions 96 billion paid to repurchase our common stock and 26 billion net investments in property plant and equipment all of which were partially offset by 146 billion in cash provided from operations a 63 billion net increase in our outstanding debt and commercial paper and 18 billion in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee stock plans 

we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone value fair values of undelivered elements are known uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 

we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract we record changes in revenue to income as a result of revisions to cost estimates in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

we recognize revenue on certain design and build design development andor construction of software andor systems projects using the percentageofcompletion method we use the cost to cost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill we engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by hp include customer contracts developed and core technology and the compaq trade name the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in detail in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts customer lists distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed compaq brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in hps product portfolio and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

restructuring 

we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs if the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in the results of operations section and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards granted after november 1 2005 and granted prior to but not yet vested as of november 1 2005 in accordance with sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r we recognize stockbased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate recognizing compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award prior to sfas 123r adoption we accounted for sharebased payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and accordingly generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility we utilize the blackscholes option pricing model to value the stock 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

options granted under our principal option plans to implement this model we examined our historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations from this analysis we identified three employee populations on which to apply the blackscholes model we determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hp common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility therefore expected volatility used in the blackscholes option pricing model in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 was based on marketbased implied volatility 

we issue performancebased restricted units prus representing hypothetical shares of hp common stock each pru award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient we determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a threeyear performance period based on results achieved versus goals based on our annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and average total shareholder return tsr relative to the sp 500 over the performance period we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation model as the tsr modifier contains a market condition we update the estimated expense net of forfeitures for the cashflow performance against the goal for that year at the end of each reporting period 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions respectively 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments hp has undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2022 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and over sixty foreign countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained however our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin 48 we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our reserve for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest we review our reserves quarterly and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations or new case law previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices execution of advanced pricing agreements resolution with respect to individual audit issues the resolution of entire audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations in addition our tax contingency reserve includes certain amounts for potential tax assessments for preacquisition tax years of acquired companies which if released prior to the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas 141r will impact the carrying value of goodwill attributable to the acquired company 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors including the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors the financial condition of customers the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions significant onetime events and historical experience also we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if circumstances related to customers change we would further adjust our estimates of the 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

recoverability of receivables either upward or downward the annual general provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 003 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2008 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately 105 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2008 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand rapid technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 

valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived purchased intangible assets 

we review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets the provisions of sfas no 142 require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference sfas no 142 also requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 did not result in an impairment charge the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

hps reporting units as of august 1 2008 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 700 million to approximately 379 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately 500 million to approximately 335 billion for each of hps reporting units 

warranty provision 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms ongoing product failure rates repair costs product call rates average cost per call and current period product shipments if actual product failure rates repair rates or any other post sales support costs differ from our estimates we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 33 of annual net product revenue while actual annual warranty costs have averaged approximately 31 of annual net product revenue 

retirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates salary growth longterm return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the salary growth assumptions reflect our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook longterm return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and managements expectation of the future economic environment as well as target asset allocations 

in the beginning of fiscal 2008 we implemented a liabilitydriven investment strategy for the hp us defined benefit pension plan which was frozen effective december 31 2007 as part of the strategy we have transitioned our investment allocation for that plan to predominantly fixed income assets the expected return on the plan assets used in calculating the net benefit cost is 610 for fiscal 2009 which reflects this change in our asset allocation policy 

our medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics and in general changes if any have moved in the 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

same direction over the last several years for fiscal 2008 changes in the weightedaverage rates for the hp benefit plans would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost 

• a decrease of 25 basis points in the longterm rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 36 million • a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 46 million and • an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 12 million recent accounting pronouncements 

as previously reported in our 2007 annual report on form 10k we recognized the funded status of our benefit plans at october 31 2007 in accordance with the recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 in addition to the recognition provisions sfas 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of their fiscal year end effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 we will adopt the measurement provisions of sfas 158 effective october 31 2009 for the hp pension and post retirements plans we do not expect the adoption of the measurement provisions of sfas 158 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

movement of the dollar against the euro us net revenue was 369 billion for fiscal 2008 an increase of 6 from the prior year while international net revenue increased 17 to 814 billion 

psg net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 as a result of a unit volume increase of 22 the unit volume increase was the result of strong growth in notebooks with continued strength in emerging markets the positive revenue impact from this unit volume increase was moderated by declines in average selling prices asps in commercial and consumer clients of 7 and 4 respectively 

hps net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of eds on august 26 2008 hps net revenue excluding eds also increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 as a result of revenue growth in technology services primarily from it solution support services existing account growth in outsourcing services and base business growth in our consulting and integration business unit 

ipg net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 due to the growth in supplies net revenue as a result of higher unit volumes with strong performance from colorrelated products for fiscal 2008 commercial and consumer hardware net revenues declined due primarily to competitive pricing pressures and a slowing economy 

ess net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 over the prioryear period due primarily to strong performance in storage which was due in part to growth within our eva and msa product lines and revenue growth in industry standard servers from increased unit volumes and blade revenues fiscal 2008 revenues in business critical systems were flat compared to the prioryear period 

hp software net revenue growth in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was attributable to strong growth in our business technology optimization bto business unit resulting from revenue increases in support growth in license revenue partially as a result of our acquisition of opsware inc opsware in september 2007 and to a lesser extent increased services contract sales 

hpfs net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the mix of operating leases as a portion of our asset portfolio and growth in average portfolio assets 

in fiscal 2007 hp net revenue increased approximately 14 from the prioryear period 10 on a constant currency basis the favorable currency impact for fiscal 2007 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro us net revenue was 348 billion for fiscal 2007 an increase of 8 from the prior year while international net revenue increased 17 to 695 billion 

psg had doubledigit net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 across all regions as a result of overall unit volume increases of 28 the unit volume increases resulted from strong growth in notebooks with significant improvements in emerging markets the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in asps in commercial and consumer clients of 5 and 1 respectively 

hps net revenue during fiscal 2007 increased due primarily to favorable currency impacts revenue increases in outsourcing services driven by existing accounts growth and new business and revenue increases in consulting and integration associated with acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 

ipg net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was due mainly to increased unit volumes of printer supplies resulting from the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the strong performance of supplies for colorrelated products

gross margin 

the weightedaverage components of the change in gross margin as compared to prioryear periods were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 



total company gross margin decreased slightly in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 on a segment basis an increase in hp software gross margin and a small increase in ess gross margin were offset by small gross margin declines in hps and hpfs and flat gross margin growth across our remaining segments 

for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the improvement in hp software gross margin was primarily the result of cost savings in the bto business unit 

the slight improvement in ess gross margin in fiscal 2008 from the prior year was primarily a result of improved cost management and attach rates in industry standard servers 

in fiscal 2008 psg gross margin remained flat due primarily to declining asps offset by an increase in the attach rate of highermargin options 

ipg gross margin remained flat in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 with improved supplies margins resulting from mix shifts being offset by unfavorable hardware margins 

hps gross margin declined in fiscal 2008 from the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of eds in the fourth quarter without the impact of the eds acquisition hps gross margin would have increased for the fiscal year 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

hpfs gross margin declined slightly in fiscal 2008 due primarily to higher bad debt expenses the effect of which was partially offset by increased margins on endoflease activity 

total company gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 

the improvement in hp software gross margin in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a favorable change in revenue mix driven by the inclusion of revenue from mercury licenses and support which typically have a higher gross margin than the other offerings within the segment 

during fiscal 2007 ess contributed unfavorably to our total companys weightedaverage change in gross margin while the ess gross margin remained stable this stability was due primarily to improved cost management which was offset by an ongoing mix shift to lowermargin integrity products within business critical systems and a continued mix shift towards industry standard servers 

during fiscal 2007 psg contributed unfavorably to our total companys weightedaverage change in gross margin as a result of higher growth than the other segments however psg gross margin increased primarily as a result of component cost declines and improvements in supply chain costs per unit which were partially offset by asp declines 

during fiscal 2007 ipg gross margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable hardware margins increased costs associated with new product introductions and a change in product mix 

hps gross margin increased during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to continued focus on cost structure improvements from delivery efficiencies and cost controls this gross margin increase was partially offset by the impact from the continued competitive pricing environment 

hpfs gross margin decline during fiscal 2007 was caused primarily by increased bad debt expenses and lower bad debt recoveries as well as lower margins on leases and used equipment sales 

operating expenses 

research and development 

total research and development rd decreased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to effective cost controls the effect of which was partially offset by the unfavorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro each of our major segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in rd expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 

total rd expense increased in fiscal 2007 due primarily to additional rd expense as a result of the mercury acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as a percentage of net revenue each of our major segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in rd expense in fiscal 2007

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the increase in amortization expense during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to amortization expenses related to the eds acquisition as well as other acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 

the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to amortization expense related to the acquisition of mercury in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 this increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions including the compaq computer corporation compaq acquisition that had reached the end of their amortization period

in fiscal 2007 we recognized a net gain on pension curtailments and settlements of 517 million relating primarily to a 542 million curtailment gain associated with a modification to our us defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan this curtailment gain was offset partially by net settlement losses related to our other pension plan design changes 

for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

interest and other net 

interest and other net decreased by 458 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease resulted primarily from currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement items and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates the effect of which was partially offset by lower interest expense additionally the prioryear period benefited from higher gains from the sale of real estate 

interest and other net decreased by 173 million in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the decrease was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances net gains on investment in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from gains on the sale of equity investments which were offset in part by impairment charges on our investment portfolio 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 205 208 and 138 in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was related in part to lower tax rates in other jurisdictions 

hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was related in part to favorable income tax adjustments of 599 million recorded in fiscal 2006 which included net favorable tax adjustments of 565 million to income tax accruals as a result of the settlement of the internal revenue service irs examinations of our us income tax returns for fiscal years 1993 to 1998 the reductions to the net income tax accruals for these years related primarily to the resolution of issues with respect to puerto rico manufacturing tax incentives and export tax incentives and other issues involving our nonus operations

hp software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 65 percentage points in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the operating margin increase in fiscal 2008 was the result of a combination of an increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in gross margin in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to cost savings in the bto business cost structure improvements as a result of increased scale in the information management business and to a lesser extent a favorable change in the revenue mix driven by higher revenues from the bto business which typically has higher gross margins than the remainder of the segment the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to continued cost controls the effect of which was partially offset by increased field selling costs driven by sales force investments 

hp software net revenue increased 761 728 when adjusted for currency in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the favorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro excluding the results of mercury hp softwares revenue grew 96 in fiscal 2007 net revenue associated with the acquisition of mercury was included in the results of bto which increased 125 in fiscal 2007 and 18 in the same respective period without mercury bto net revenue growth also was the result of increases in revenue from license and support contracts net revenue for other software decreased 4 in fiscal 2007 the decrease in other software net revenue was due primarily to a platform shift that resulted in a transfer of the hardware revenue to ess 

the operating margin improvement of 99 percentage points in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was the result primarily of an increase in gross margin and to a lesser degree a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 the improvement in gross margin was a result of a favorable change in revenue mix driven by the inclusion of revenue from mercury licenses

the decrease in consumer hardware net revenue in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was due primarily to discontinued sales of cameras competitive pricing pressures and lower unit volumes of consumer hardware as a result of slower growth in the overall consumer printer market both consumer and commercial hardware were impacted by the continued shift in demand to lowerpriced products and a slowing economy which caused average revenue per unit in each category to decline 

ipg earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 04 percentage points in fiscal 2008 from the prior fiscal year the operating margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 the gross margin remained flat driven by improved margins for supplies as a result of product mix the effect of which was offset by unfavorable hardware margins the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to higher revenue and continued cost controls the effect of which was partially offset by increased investments in our enterprise printing sales force

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws we have provided for the united states federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states repatriation could result in additional united states federal income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

the information discussed below is presented based on our historical results which include the results of eds for the period following the august 26 2008 closing date of the acquisition

financial condition sources and uses of cash 

our total cash and cash equivalents declined approximately 10 to 102 billion at october 31 2008 from 113 billion at october 31 2007 due primarily to increased investment spending on acquisitions and increased borrowings which were partially offset by positive operating cash flows our cash position remains strong and we believe our cash balances are sufficient to cover cash outlays expected in fiscal 2009 associated with additional stock repurchases acquisitions company bonus payments and other operating cash requirements 



key performance metrics 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average net revenue 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing inventory by a 90day average cost of goods sold 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold 

our working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo 

the increase in dso was due primarily to a higher accounts receivable balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the same period in fiscal 2007 and the effect of the eds acquisition the decrease in dos was due primarily to more efficient inventory management higher cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of increased revenues and the effect of the eds acquisition the slight decrease in dpo was due primarily to purchasing linearity and improved

2008 compared to 2007 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 50 billion during fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 the increase was due primarily to higher net earnings in fiscal 2008 a decrease in accounts and financing receivables and increased accounts payable

net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 46 billion in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 due primarily to higher cash payments made in connection with acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately 36 billion during fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 the decrease was due primarily to higher net issuance of commercial paper and debt 

common stock repurchases 

we repurchase shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee benefit plans as well as to repurchase shares opportunistically this program authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions in fiscal 2008 we completed share repurchases of approximately 230 million shares repurchases of approximately 216 million shares were settled for 96 billion which included approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2007 but settled in fiscal 2008 at the end of fiscal 2008 we had approximately 14 million shares which would be settled in the next fiscal year in fiscal 2007 we completed share repurchases of approximately 209 million shares repurchases of approximately 210 million shares were settled for 91 billion in fiscal 2007 including approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2006 but settled in fiscal 2007

2007 compared to 2006 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 17 billion during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the decrease was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable a decrease in accounts payable and higher payments for bonuses earned in fiscal 2006 and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the decease in our cash flow from operations was partially offset by higher earnings in fiscal 2007

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 63 billion in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher cash payments made in connection with acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 05 billion during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the decrease was due primarily to higher net issuance of commercial paper and debt the impact of which was partially offset by increased repurchases of our common stock 

common stock repurchases 

in fiscal 2007 we completed share repurchases of approximately 209 million shares repurchases of approximately 210 million shares were settled for 91 billion which included approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2006 but settled in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2006 we completed share repurchases of approximately 188 million shares repurchases of approximately 190 million shares were settled for 61 billion in fiscal 2006 including 2 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2005 but settled in fiscal 2006 

in addition to the above transactions we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program the asr program with a thirdparty investment bank during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 pursuant to the terms of the asr program we purchased 40 million shares of our common stock from a thirdparty bank for 18 billion the purchase price on march 30 2007 the purchase date we decreased our shares outstanding and reduced the outstanding shares used to calculate the weightedaverage common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted eps on the purchase date the shares delivered to us included shares that the investment bank borrowed from third parties the investment bank purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market to cover its position with respect to the borrowed shares during a contractually specified averaging period that began on the purchase date and ended on june 6 2007 at the end of the averaging period the investment banks total purchase cost based on the volume weightedaverage purchase price of our shares during the averaging period was approximately 90 million less than the purchase price accordingly we had the option to receive either additional shares of our common stock or a cash payment in the amount of the difference from the investment bank in june 2007 we received approximately 2 million additional shares purchased by the investment bank in the open market with a value approximately equal to that amount we reduced our shares outstanding upon receipt of those shares 

also we entered into a prepaid variable share purchase program pvspp with a thirdparty investment bank during the first quarter of 2006 and prepaid 17 billion in exchange for the right to receive a variable number of shares of our common stock weekly over a oneyear period beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and ending during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we completed all repurchases under the pvspp on march 9 2007 as of that date we had cumulatively received a total of 53 million shares we retired all shares repurchased and no longer deem those shares outstanding

liquidity 

as previously discussed we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support business operations capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to a level of discretionary investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this nearterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions 

we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities and our overall cost of capital outstanding debt increased to 179 billion as of october 31 2008 as compared to 82 billion at october 31 2007 bearing weightedaverage interest rates of 39 and 52 respectively shortterm borrowings increased to 102 billion at october 31 2008 from 32 billion at october 31 2007 the increase in shortterm borrowings was due primarily to the net issuance of approximately 50 billion of our commercial paper including 99 billion of commercial paper issued to fund the acquisition of eds and the reclassification from longterm to shortterm debt including 10 billion in global notes that will mature in june 2009 750 million in global notes that will mature in september 2009 and 700 million in senior notes that will mature in october 2009 during fiscal 2008 we issued 400 billion and repaid 349 billion of commercial paper longterm debt increased to 77 billion at october 31 2008 from 50 billion at october 31 2007 the increase in longterm debt was due primarily to the issuance of an aggregate of 30 billion in global notes in march 2008 and the assumption of 26 billion of debt in connection with the eds acquisition the effect of which was offset by the repayment of 500 million in global notes at maturity in march 2008 the repayment of 50 million of series a mediumterm notes at maturity in december 2007 the redemption of approximately 377 million in zerocoupon subordinated convertible notes in march 2008 and the reclassifications from longterm to shortterm debt as of october 31 2008 we had 61 million in total borrowings collateralized by certain financing receivable assets 

as of october 31 2008 a significant portion of our outstanding debt is related to hpfs we issue debt in order to finance hpfs and as needed for other purposes including acquisitions hpfs has a business model that is assetintensive in nature and therefore we fund hpfs more by debt than we fund our other business segments at october 31 2008 hpfs had approximately 81 billion in net portfolio assets which included short and longterm financing receivables and operating lease assets 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information about our borrowings

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

at october 31 2008 we had the following resources available to obtain shortterm or longterm financings if we need additional liquidity 



1 we are unable to issue any additional securities under the 2002 shelf registration statement as of december 1 2008 2 approximately 863 million of this amount was recorded as debt as of october 31 2008 the remaining amount was used to satisfy business operational requirements in addition to the financing resources listed above we had the additional borrowing resources described below 

in may 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement the 2006 shelf registration statement with the sec to enable us to offer and sell from time to time in one or more offerings an unlimited amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants 

we have a 29 billion us credit facility expiring in may 2012 in february and july 2008 we entered into additional 364day credit facilities of 30 billion and 80 billion respectively the credit facilities are senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangements that we put in place primarily to support our us commercial paper program under the terms of the july 2008 credit facility the amount of credit available declines in an amount equal to the proceeds of any future issuance of longterm debt by us on december 5 2008 we issued 20 billion of global notes under the 2006 shelf registration statement which resulted in a reduction in the amount of credit available under the july 2008 credit facility to 60 billion our ability to have a us commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the 119 billion supported by our credit facilities is subject to a number of factors including liquidity conditions and business performance 

in october 2008 we registered for the commercial paper funding facility cpff provided by the federal reserve bank of new york the facility enables us to issue threemonth unsecured commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle of the federal reserve at a rate established by the cpff program which is currently equal to a spread over the threemonth overnight index swap rate the maximum amount of commercial paper that we may issue at any time through this program is 104 billion less the total principal amount of all other outstanding commercial paper that we have issued we will be unable to issue commercial paper under the program after april 30 2009 as of october 31 2008 we had not issued any commercial paper under the cpff program

our credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them standard  poors ratings services moodys investors service and fitch ratings currently rate our senior unsecured longterm debt a a2 and a and our shortterm debt a1 prime1 and f1 respectively we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt however a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities also a downgrade in our credit rating could limit our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs if this occurs we would seek alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facility or the issuance of notes under our existing shelf registration statements 

contractual obligations 

the impact that we expect our contractual obligations as of october 31 2008 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts included in our longterm debt are approximately 372 million of capital lease obligations that are secured by certain equipment 2 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items in addition to the above at october 31 2008 we had approximately 17 billion of recorded fin 48 liabilities and related interest and penalties of this liability amount approximately 340 million is expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters the 17 billion of fin 48 liabilities and related interest and penalties will be partially offset by 330 million of deferred tax assets and interest receivable

we will make a significant cash payment associated with our fiscal 2008 bonus programs we have implemented bonus programs that are designed to reward our employees upon achievement of annual performance objectives we calculate bonuses based on a formula with performance relative to targets year over year improvements and market conditions that are set at the beginning of each fiscal year our board of directors approves the final bonus payments we accrued and expensed this bonus as it was earned throughout fiscal 2008 

in connection with the acquisition of eds we implemented a restructuring program to streamline our services business and to better align the structure and efficiency of that business with the operating model that we have successfully implemented in recent years the restructuring program will be implemented over the next four years and will include changes to our workforce as well as cost savings from corporate overhead functions such as real estate it and procurement as part of the restructuring program we expect to eliminate approximately 24700 positions with nearly half of the eliminations occurring in the united states as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect future cash expenditures of approximately 21 billion we expect to make cash payments of approximately 13 billion in fiscal 2009 and the majority of the remaining amount through 2012

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of october 31 2008 we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spes

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

these guarantees in the event our or our subsidiaries nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client the likelihood of which we believe is remote we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee 

as a result of the acquisition of eds we acquired certain service contracts supported by client financing or securitization arrangements under specific circumstances involving non performance resulting in service contract termination or failure to comply with terms under the financing arrangement we would be required to acquire certain assets we consider the possibility of our failure to comply to be remote and the asset amounts involved not material 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the thirdparty to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments we have made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant to our operations for fiscal 2008 were the euro the japanese yen and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany lease loan denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures we recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currencydenominated exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2008 and 2007 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2008 and 2007 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of 141 million and 104 million at october 31 2008 and october 31 2007 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then typically use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for 

floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2008 and 2007 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investment instruments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables the discount rates we used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2008 and 2007 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investment instruments and financing receivables net of interest rate swap positions of 9 million at october 31 2008 and 17 million at october 31 2007 

equity price risk 

we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities which had an estimated fair value of 5 million at october 31 2008 and 9 million at october 31 2007 we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of the equity investment exceeds its fair value and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value generally we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities however we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of 2 million at october 31 2008 and 3 million at october 31 2007 the aggregate cost of privatelyheld companies marketable trading securities and other investments was 425 million at october 31 2008 and 533 million at october 31 2007

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups and distribution is organized by direct and channel within the channel we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups the partners include 

• retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores • resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships • independent distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no presence • original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated products 7 

• independent software vendors isvs that provide their clients with specialized software products frequently driving sales of additional nonhp products and services and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products and • systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with hps to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services the mix of hps business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions necessitate sales marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly hp is focused on driving efficiencies and productivity gains in both the direct and indirect business 

tsg manages enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also is charged with simplifying sales processes across our segments to improve speed and effectiveness of customer delivery in this capacity tsg manages our direct sales for both volume and value products including industry standard servers products unix® enterprise storage and software and presales technical consultants as well as our direct distribution activities for commercial products and gotomarket activities with systems integrators and isvs tsg also drives hps vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication media and entertainment financial services manufacturing and distribution and public sector industries 

psg manages smb customer relationships and commercial reseller channels due largely to the significant volume of commercial pcs that hp sells through these channels in addition to commercial channel relationships the volume direct organization which is charged with the management of direct sales for volume products is hosted within psg 

ipg manages hps overall consumerrelated sales and marketing activities including our annual consumer product launch for the backtoschool and holiday seasons ipg also manages consumer channel relationships with thirdparty retail locations for imaging and printing products as well as other consumer products including consumer pcs which provides for a bundled sale opportunity between pcs and ipg products in addition ipg manages direct consumer sales online through hp home  home office 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a number of contract manufacturers cms and original design manufacturers odms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of cms and odms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain hpdesigned products thirdparty oems manufacture some products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of cms and odms we currently manufacture finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we employ building products to order capabilities to maximize manufacturing efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software customization requirements of certain customers our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies and parts for 

products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations we are dependent upon intel as a supplier of processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors we also have a valued relationship with amd and we have continued to see solid acceptance of amd processors in the market during fiscal 2007 

like other participants in the high technology industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints of certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production on occasion we acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 67 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2007 came from outside the united states the substantial majority of our net revenue originating outside the united states was from customers other than foreign governments 

for a discussion of risks attendant to hps foreign operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

we remain committed to innovation as a key element of hps culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hp labs together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 36 billion in each of fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and 35 billion in fiscal 2005 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

patents 

our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2007 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 31000 patents which was slightly above the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary while we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments 

in addition to developing our patents we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interests these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of net revenue related to our service and support businesses therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales often are weaker in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factors—our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and availability of application software and our internet infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

on an overall basis we are among the largest usbased companies offering our range of general purpose computers and personal information imaging and printing products for industrial scientific business and consumer applications and it services we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

enterprise storage and servers the areas in which ess operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price reductions our competitors range from broad solutions providers such as international business machines corporation ibm to more focused competitors such as emc corporation and network appliance inc in storage dell inc dell in industry standard servers and sun microsystems inc in both industry standard and unix®based servers we believe that our important competitive advantages in this segment include the six technology components of our adaptive infrastructure initiatives it systems power and cooling security management virtualization and automation we believe that our competitive advantages also include our global reach and our significant intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities which will contribute to further enhancements of our product offerings and our ability to cross sell our portfolio and leverage scale advantages in everything from brand to procurement leverage 

hp services hps competes in it support services consulting and integration and outsourcing services the it support services and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as our customers have reduced their it budgets however this trend has benefited the outsourcing services business as customers look at reducing it management costs to enable more strategic investments our competitors include ibm global services systems integration firms such as accenture ltd outsourcing firms such as electronic data systems corporation and offshore companies we also compete with other traditional hardware providers such as dell which are increasingly offering services to support their products many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition hps teams with many companies to offer services and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities our competitive advantages are evident in our deep technology expertise which includes multivendor environments virtualization and automation our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources in sap oracle and microsoft platforms 

hp software our software competitors include companies focused on providing software solutions for it management such as bmc software inc ca inc and ibm tivoli software 

personal systems group the areas in which psg operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid price reductions and inventory depreciation our primary competitors for the branded personal computers are dell acer inc apple inc lenovo group limited and toshiba corporation in particular regions we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or white box manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities our brand and procurement leverage our ability to cross sell our portfolio of offerings our extensive service and support offerings and the availability of our broadbased distribution of products from retail and commercial channels to direct sales 

imaging and printing group we are the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer hardware printing supplies and scanning devices we believe that our brand recognition reputation for quality breadth of product offerings and large customer base are important competitive advantages however the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features ipgs key competitors include canon usa inc lexmark international inc xerox corporation xerox seiko epson corporation samsung electronics co ltd and dell in addition independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for our supplies which although generally offering lower print quality and reliability may be offered at lower prices and put pressure on our supplies sales and margins other companies also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laser and inkjet products particularly in jurisdictions outside of the united states where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist in recent years we and our competitors have regularly lowered prices on printer hardware both to reach new customers and in response to the competitive environment important areas for future growth include digital photography in the home and outside the home printerbased multifunction devices in the office space digital presses in our imaging and graphics space and driving color printing expansion in the office while we encounter competitors in some product categories whose current market share is greater than ours such as xerox in copiers and heidelberger druckmaschinen aktiengesellschaft in publishing we believe we will provide important new contributions in the home the office and publishing environments by providing comprehensive solutions

environment 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites many of our products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in products including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including the restrictions on 

lead cadmium and certain other substances that apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the european union the eu as of july 1 2006 restriction of hazardous substances directive and similar legislation in china the labeling provisions of which went into effect march 1 2007 we also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product takeback legislation the eu has enacted the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive which makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products the deadline for the individual member states of the eu to enact the directive in their respective countries was august 13 2004 such legislation together with the directive the weee legislation producers participating in the market became financially responsible for implementing their responsibilities under the weee legislation beginning in august 2005 implementation in certain eu member states was delayed into 2006 and 2007 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico china and japan it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the united states even if we are not subject to regulations imposed by local governments the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when hp considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations or financial position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

 item 1a risk factors 

because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

the competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our operations results and prospects could be harmed 

unlike many of our competitors we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin the markets in which we do business particularly the personal computer and printing markets are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for these products our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with hps supplies business in addition other companies have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for hps laserjet and inkjet products particularly in jurisdictions outside of the united states where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist hp expects competitive refill and remanufacturing and cloned cartridge activity to continue to pressure margins in ipg which in turn has a significant impact on hp margins and profitability overall 

if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer 

the process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations we must make longterm investments develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at all or within a given products life cycle any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product could result in our not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as 

well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions however we may have limited ability to control quality issues particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products our operating margins could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue may suffer 

many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue may decline 

our revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be overlaps in the current products and services of hp and portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer 

our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations however any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm further the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to 

protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position 

because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition transaction third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example in recent years individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies such as hp if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source our operations could suffer even if we believe that the claims are without merit the claims can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreements to us 

finally our results of operations and cash flows could be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing against hp seeking to impose levies upon equipment such as pcs multifunction devices and printers and alleging that the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content other countries that do not yet have levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices if imposed the amount of copyright levies would depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which may be affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving hp and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries but could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these potential copyright levies or similar fees and the ability of hp to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain 

economic uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses 

our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and constrained it spending has previously resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables we could experience such economic weakness and reduced spending particularly in our consumer and financial services businesses due to increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets access to credit and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior in addition customer financial difficulties have previously resulted and could result in the future in increases in bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables portfolio inability by our lessees to make required lease 

payments and reduction in the value of leased equipment upon its return to us compared to the value estimated at lease inception we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures inventory writedowns charges associated with the cancellation of planned production line expansion and increases in pension and postretirement benefit expenses economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations prospects and stock price 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

sales outside the united states make up approximately 67 of our net revenue our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition also could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products • local labor conditions and regulations • managing a geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the regulatory or legal environment • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

as approximately 67 of our sales are from countries outside of the united states other currencies particularly the euro and the japanese yen can have an impact on hps results expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of 

the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

terrorist acts conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to hp our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars including the ongoing military operations in iraq have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults is unknown but our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster in addition some areas including california and parts of the east coast southwest and midwest of the united states have previously experienced and may experience in the future major power shortages and blackouts these blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers distributors and resellers or customers moreover the consolidation of all of our worldwide it data centers into six centers located in the southern united states when completed could increase the impact on us of a natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in that geographic area 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margin and profitability could suffer 

we use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most 

advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below 

• our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

• our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe and the long lead times that are required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below 

• shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain supplies as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of which are also customers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers in particular our pc business relies heavily upon contract manufacturers cms and original design manufacturers odms to manufacture its products and is 21 

therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those cms and odms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these cms and odms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular cm or odm could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the cm or odm and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that cm or odm if shortages or delays persist the price of these supplies may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the supplies may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough supplies at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings resulting in further costs and delays 

• oversupply in order to secure supplies for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase supplies strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future supplies if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin • contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase supplies or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions in the event that we become committed to purchase supplies or services for prices in excess of the current market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices and our gross margin could suffer in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same cms odms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain cms odms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its cms and odms may create large supplier receivables with the cms and odms that depending on the financial condition of the cms and odms may have a risk of uncollectibility in addition certain of our cms odms and suppliers may decide in the future to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors cms odms or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers as described above our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations handheld computing devices and servers and some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for 22 

additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of supplies to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely effect our revenue and gross margins 

if we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations our revenue could suffer 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we are currently and in the future may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a material reduction in expected revenue 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue in particular ipg and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our gross margin and profitability competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting ipg therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments and ess in particular have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report in addition as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates under the provisions of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in hps tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states any of these changes could affect our profitability 

our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occur towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there will be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter other developments late in a quarter such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the united states government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely 

impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to execute planned cost reductions successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected 

we have adopted restructuring and other cost reduction plans to bring operational expenses to appropriate levels for each of our businesses while simultaneously implementing extensive new companywide expense control programs these initiatives include 

• a workforce restructuring program and a related us early retirement program announced in july 2005 that we expect to result in the elimination of approximately 14985 positions by the end of fiscal 2008 • a multiyear plan announced in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 to reduce it spending by consolidating hps 85 data centers worldwide into six larger centers located in three us cities • a multiyear program announced in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 to reduce real estate costs by consolidating several hundred hp real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites • modifications to our defined benefit pension plan our subsidized retiree medical program and our 401k plan announced in february 2007 pursuant to which affected employees will cease accruing pension benefits and will instead receive an increased 401k match effective january 1 2008 and • a us early retirement program announced in february 2007 under which 3080 employees left the company as of may 31 2007 all of whom have been or we expect will be replaced our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions regarding the cost of consolidating the data centers and real estate locations the amount of accelerated depreciation or asset impairment to be incurred when we vacate facilities or cease using equipment before the end of their respective lease term or asset life the savings associated with the benefit plan changes announced in february 2007 the costs associated with the replacement of employees who retired under the february 2007 early retirement program and the costs and timing of other activities in connection with these initiatives these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in order to be successful we must attract retain and motivate key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense the failure to hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations 

changes to our compensation and benefit programs could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have historically used stock options and other forms of sharebased payment awards as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages hp began recording charges to earnings for stockbased compensation expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment as a result we began to incur increased compensation costs associated with our stockbased compensation programs moreover difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it harder or more expensive for us to grant sharebased payment awards to employees in the future like other companies hp has reviewed its equity compensation strategy in light of the current regulatory and competitive environment and has reduced the total number of sharebased payment awards granted to employees and the number of employees who receive sharebased payment awards due to this change in our stockbased compensation strategy combined with the pension and other benefit plan changes undertaken to reduce costs and our increasing reliance on variable pay we may find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business 

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict 

hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation in the press or investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of cost cutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions or executive team • the announcement of new products services technological innovations or acquisitions by hp or its competitors and • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flow from operations changes in estimates by the investment community or guidance provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results general or industryspecific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp common stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition following periods of volatility in a companys securities securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted if instituted against hp this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

system security risks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could harm our revenue increase our expenses and harm our reputation and stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns in addition computer programmers and hackers may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit 

any security vulnerabilities of our products as a result we could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by security breaches of our network and any security vulnerabilities of our products moreover we could lose existing or potential customers for information technology outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data including our current project to consolidate all of our worldwide it data centers into six centers which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected in the past and in the future could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

any failure by us to manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and may result in financial results that are different than expected 

as part of our business strategy we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses divest noncore businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are integrated simultaneously if we fail to identify and complete successfully business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue gross margin and profitability 

integration issues are complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business the challenges involved in integration include 

• combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code 27 

• minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns • persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions we evaluate and enter into significant business combination and investment transactions on an ongoing basis we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees suppliers or other third parties in addition the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable 

managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations these business combination and investment transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inprocess research and development charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans moreover hp has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets in order to complete an acquisition we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders or borrow affecting our financial condition and potentially our credit ratings any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms in addition hps effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate we also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close as a result any completed pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter 

we cannot predict the outcome of various regulatory inquiries and stockholder derivative action lawsuits arising out of the processes employed in the investigation into leaks of hp confidential information to members of the media and we may be named in additional regulatory inquiries and stockholder litigation all of which could result in significant legal and other expenses 

the attorney general of the state of california the committee on energy and commerce of the us house of representatives the us attorney for the northern district of california the division of enforcement of the sec and the us federal communications commission all have conducted inquiries or investigations relating to the processes employed in an investigation into leaks of hp confidential information to members of the media that concluded in may 2006 we have entered into an agreement with the california attorney general to resolve civil claims relating to the leak investigation under the terms of the agreement which includes an injunction we have paid a total of 145 million and agreed to implement and maintain for five years a series of measures designed to ensure that hps corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with california law and the companys high ethical standards we also have consented to the entry of an order by the sec ordering hp to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the public reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended if we fail to implement and maintain the measures required under the agreement with the california attorney general or if we fail to comply with the sec cease and desist order we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

four stockholder derivative lawsuits also have been filed in california all of which have been consolidated into a single lawsuit and two in delaware both of which have been consolidated into a single lawsuit purportedly on behalf of hp stockholders seeking to recover damages and to obtain specified injunctive relief stemming from the activities of the leak investigations we may in the future also be subject to additional litigation or other proceedings arising in relation to these matters the period of time necessary to resolve the stockholder lawsuits is uncertain and the expense of defending and concluding such litigation may be significant in addition we may be obligated to indemnify and advance legal expenses to former or current directors officers or employees in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation bylaws other applicable agreements and delaware law 

unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection such as laws governing the conduct of our facilities and operations with respect to the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental cleanup to sites outside the united states even where we are not required to do so under applicable local laws and regulations many of our products are subject to various federal state and international laws governing chemical substances including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis we record a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs when we consider the costs to be probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including the restrictions on lead cadmium and certain other substances that apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the european union as of july 1 2006 restriction of hazardous substances directive and 

similar legislation in other countries including china japan and korea we also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product takeback legislation the eu has enacted the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the weee legislation which makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico china and japan we are continuing to evaluate the cumulative impact of and are taking steps to comply with the weee legislation and similar legislation in other jurisdictions as individual countries issue their implementation legislation and guidance 

some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which hp could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to hps directors and officers • specifying that hp stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings • requiring advance notice of proposals by hp stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors • requiring a vote by the holders of twothirds of hps outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to hp stockholder meetings the board of directors and indemnification and • controlling the procedures for conduct of hp board and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of hp directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation hp also is subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of hps outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp common stock

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of products technologies software solutions and services to individual consumers small and mediumsized businesses smbs and large enterprises including in the public and education sectors our offerings span 

• personal computing and other access devices • imaging and printingrelated products and services • enterprise information technology infrastructure including enterprise storage and server technology and software that optimizes business technology investments and • multivendor customer services including technology support and maintenance consulting and integration and outsourcing services we have seven business segments enterprise storage and servers ess hp services hps hp software the personal systems group psg the imaging and printing group ipg hp financial services hpfs and corporate investments ess hps and hp software are structured beneath a broader technology solutions group tsg while tsg is not an operating segment we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within tsg in order to provide a supplementary view of our business 

the operating framework in which we manage our businesses and guide our strategies is based on the disciplined management of three business levers targeted growth operational efficiency and capital strategy although we have made progress towards our goals in recent periods there are still many areas in which we believe that we can improve to implement this operating framework we are focused on the following initiatives 

• we are engaged in a process of examining every function and every business in the company in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost • we are in the process of consolidating 85 data centers worldwide into six stateoftheart centers in three us cities and consolidating several hundred real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites in order to reduce our it spending and real estate costs • we are reinvesting a portion of the cost savings from these initiatives by expanding our sales force and aligning our resources in order to build our market share in emerging markets while expanding our coverage to drive growth in mature markets • we are developing training programs for our sales forces designed to enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers and build customer loyalty • we are building and expanding our services organization to support our technology businesses and provide comprehensive solutions to our customers • we are developing a global delivery structure to take advantage of regions where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs 35 

• we are expanding our ethics and compliance programs and enhancing our corporate governance to ensure that all of our actions are consistent with hps values and • we are repurchasing shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase shares opportunistically we continue to grow our business organically and through strategic acquisitions during fiscal 2007 we acquired ten companies among which the two largest were mercury interactive corporation mercury and opsware inc and we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions periodically in the future 

in february 2007 we announced our decision to modify our us defined benefit pension plan for the remaining number of us employees still accruing benefits under the program effective january 1 2008 these employees will cease accruing pension benefits and will instead receive an increased 401k match to 6 percent from 4 percent of eligible earnings the final pension benefit amount will be calculated based on pay and service through december 31 2007 in addition future eligibility for the pre2003 hp retiree medical program was limited to those employees who were within five years of satisfying the programs eligibility criteria on june 30 2007 these actions reduced our us defined benefit and postretirement plan obligations and as a result we recorded a onetime curtailment gain of 542 million in fiscal 2007 in conjunction with this announcement we provided eligible affected employees with the opportunity to participate in a 2007 us enhanced early retirement program the 2007 eer and recorded a restructuring charge of 354 million during fiscal 2007 a total of 3080 employees participated in the 2007 eer including 595 persons who had been included in previous restructuring programs or who voluntarily left the company since november 30 2006 all employees who participated in the 2007 eer left the company by may 31 2007 for more information see notes 8 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

in terms of how our execution has translated into financial performance the following provides an overview of our key fiscal 2007 financial metrics 

 cash and cash equivalents at october 31 2007 totaled 113 billion a decrease of 51 billion from the october 31 2006 balance of 164 billion the decrease for fiscal 2007 was related primarily to 109 billion paid to repurchase our common stock 68 billion of net cash paid for business acquisitions and 25 billion net investments in property plant and equipment all of which were 

partially offset by 96 billion in cash provided from operations 31 billion in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee stock plans and a 26 billion net increase in our debt and commercial paper 

we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 

for a further discussion of factors that could impact operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone value fair values of undelivered elements are known uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements changes in the allocation of the sales price 

between elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 

we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract we record changes in revenue as a result of revisions to cost estimates to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 

restructuring 

we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs if the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in the results of operations section and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

stockbased compensation expense 

effective november 1 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated prior periods results under this method we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards granted after november 1 2005 and granted prior to but not yet vested as of november 1 2005 in accordance with sfas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r we recognize stockbased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award prior to sfas 123r adoption we accounted for sharebased payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and accordingly generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility management determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hp common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility therefore expected volatility in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 was based on a marketbased implied volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of 

sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions respectively 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments hp has undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2019 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and over sixty foreign countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained however our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires significant management judgments and estimates we evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 

accounting for contingencies we believe that our reserve for income tax liabilities including related interest is adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our reserve for income tax liabilities is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest we review our reserves quarterly and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations or new case law previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices execution of advanced pricing agreements resolution with respect to individual audit issues the resolution of entire audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations material adjustments are most likely to occur in the fiscal years in which major ongoing audits such as audits by the internal revenue service irs are closed in addition our tax contingency reserve includes certain amounts for potential tax assessments for preacquisition tax years of acquired companies which if released will impact the carrying value of goodwill attributable to the acquired company 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions significant onetime events historical experience and the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors and the financial condition of customers also we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if circumstances related to customers change we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward the annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 001 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2007 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately 84 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2007 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand rapid technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 

valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived purchased intangible assets 

we review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be 

recoverable in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets the provisions of sfas no 142 require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference sfas no 142 also requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 did not result in an impairment charge the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of hps reporting units as of august 1 2007 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 520 million to approximately 46 billion in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately 360 million to approximately 41 billion for each of hps reporting units 

warranty provision 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms ongoing product failure rates repair costs product call rates average cost per call and current period product shipments if actual product failure rates repair rates service delivery costs or postsales support costs differ from our estimates we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability warranty terms generally range from 

90 days to three years parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 34 of annual net product revenue while actual annual warranty costs have averaged approximately 32 of annual net product revenue 

retirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates salary growth longterm return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the salary growth assumptions reflect our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook longterm return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and managements expectation of the future economic environment as well as target asset allocations in the beginning of fiscal 2008 we implemented a liabilitydriven investment strategy for the us defined benefit pension plan which will be frozen by december 31 2007 and is currently overfunded as part of the strategy we have transitioned our equity allocation to predominantly fixed income assets the expected return on the plan assets used in calculating the net benefit cost has been reduced from 83 to 63 for fiscal 2008 to reflect the changes in our asset allocation policy our medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics and in general changes if any have moved in the same direction over the last several years for fiscal 2007 changes in the weightedaverage rates would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost 

• a decrease of 25 basis points in the longterm rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 33 million • a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 51 million and • an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately 21 million recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the cumulative effects of applying fin 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption additionally in may 2007 the fasb published fasb staff position no fin 481 definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48 fsp fin 481 

fsp fin 481 is an amendment to fin 48 it clarifies how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits fsp fin 481 is effective upon the initial adoption of fin 48 and therefore will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 while we are still evaluating the impact of adoption of fin 48 and fsp fin 481 on our consolidated financial statements we estimate that the adoption of fin 48 and fsp fin 481 will result in a net increase to retained earnings in the range of 500 million to 900 million this estimate is subject to revision as management completes its analysis 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas 157 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 sfas 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value under sfas 159 a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities equity method investments accounts payable guarantees and issued debt other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and noncash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services if the use of fair value is elected any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred such as debt issuance costs the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value at the adoption date unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings subsequent to the adoption of sfas 159 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we currently are determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of our eligible items and cannot 

estimate the impact if any that sfas 159 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

in june 2007 the fasb also ratified eitf 073 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 073 eitf 073 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed eitf 073 is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we do not expect the adoption of eitf 073 to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

net revenue 

the components of weightedaverage net revenue growth as compared to prioryear periods were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 

 in fiscal 2007 hp net revenue increased approximately 14 from the prior year period 10 on a constant currency basis the favorable currency impact for fiscal 2007 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro us net revenue was 348 billion for fiscal 2007 an increase of 8 from the prior year while international net revenue increased 17 to 695 billion 

psg had doubledigit net revenue growth across all regions as a result of overall unit volume increases of 28 the unit volume increases resulted from strong growth in notebooks with significant improvements in emerging markets the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in average selling prices asps in commercial and consumer clients of 5 and 1 respectively ipg net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was due mainly to increased unit volumes of printer supplies resulting from the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the strong performance of supplies for colorrelated products ess net revenue growth during fiscal 2007 was the result primarily of strong blade revenue and unit growth in our industry standard servers business increased option attach rates in our proliant server line continued strong performance in midrange eva products growth in commercial storage area networks and revenue increases from our integrity servers the ess growth was partially moderated by the revenue declines in our tape business highend arrays and our parisc and alpha server product lines during fiscal 2007 the net revenue growth in hp software during fiscal 2007 was due primarily to growth in our openview business as a result of the mercury acquisition and increases in revenue from license and support contracts hps net revenue during fiscal 2007 increased due primarily to favorable currency impacts revenue increases in outsourcing services driven by existing accounts growth and new business and revenue increases in consulting and integration associated with acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 the hpfs net revenue increase during fiscal 2007 was due primarily to operating lease growth and higher endoflease activity 

in fiscal 2006 hp net revenue increased approximately 6 from the prior year period 7 on a constant currency basis the unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen us net revenue was 322 billion for fiscal 2006 an increase of 6 from the prior year while international net revenue increased 6 to 594 billion 

psg net revenue increased across all regions as a result of a 15 volume increase the volume increase resulted from strong growth in consumer and commercial markets and significant improvement in emerging markets which was partially offset by 6 and 7 declines in asps in consumer and 

commercial clients respectively ipg net revenue growth in fiscal 2006 was due mainly to increased shipment volumes of printer supplies resulting from the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the strong performance of colorrelated products ess net revenue growth was the result primarily of strong unit growth in our industry standard servers business blade revenue growth increased option attach rates in our proliant server line continued strong performance in midrange eva products within our storage business and revenue increases from our integrity servers the ess growth was moderated by revenue declines in our tape business and parisc and alpha server product lines the net revenue growth in hp software for fiscal 2006 was due primarily to growth in our openview business as a result of the peregrine acquisition and an increase in support and service contracts hps net revenue increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to revenue increases in management services driven by new business and existing account growth which were offset by declines in the technology services business resulting from competitive pricing pressures and changes in the mix of platforms being serviced the hpfs net revenue decline in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to lower used equipment sales

gross margin 

the weightedaverage components of the change in gross margin as compared to prioryear periods were as follows for the following fiscal years ended october 31 

 total company gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the improvement in hp software gross margin in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a favorable change in revenue mix driven by the inclusion of revenue from mercury licenses and support which typically have a higher gross margin than the other offerings within the segment hps gross margin increased during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to continued focus on cost structure improvements from delivery efficiencies and cost controls this gross margin increase was partially offset by the impact from the continued competitive pricing environment during fiscal 2007 ess contributed unfavorably to our total companys weightedaverage change in gross margin while the ess gross margin remained stable this stability was due primarily to improved cost management which was offset by an ongoing mix shift to lowermargin integrity products within business critical systems and a continued mix shift towards industry standard servers hpfs gross margin decline during fiscal 2007 was caused primarily by increased bad debt expenses and lower bad debt recoveries as well as lower margins on leases and 

used equipment sales during fiscal 2007 psg contributed unfavorably to our total companys weightedaverage change in gross margin as a result of higher growth than the other segments however psg gross margin increased primarily as a result of component cost declines and improvements in supply chain costs per unit which were partially offset by asp declines during fiscal 2007 ipg gross margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable hardware margins increased costs associated with new product introductions and a change in product mix 

total company gross margin increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the improvement in ess gross margin in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a favorable unit mix improved discount management and lower component costs hps gross margin increase was driven mainly by the continued focus on cost structure improvement from delivery efficiencies and cost controls the impact of which was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in the solutions and services business and higher fiscal 2006 bonus accruals for ipg gross margin increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to improved supplies margins and a favorable portfolio mix shift from hardware to supplies which were partially offset by unfavorable consumer hardware margins the improvement in hp software gross margin in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to an increase in revenue and more effective management of the support and services costs for openview and opencall the gross margin improvement in psg resulted primarily from reduced warranty expense and supply chain costs as a percentage of revenue and component cost declines hpfs gross margin was impacted unfavorably in fiscal 2006 due primarily to competitor pricing pressures a higher mix of lower margin operating lease assets and lower recoveries for bad debts which were partially offset by lower credit losses in fiscal 2006 

operating expenses 

research and development 

total research and development rd expense increased in fiscal 2007 due primarily to additional rd expense as a result of the mercury acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as a percentage of net revenue each of our major segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in rd expense in fiscal 2007 

total rd expense increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher bonus accruals and stockbased compensation expense the impact of which was partially offset by expense controls and cost savings from restructuring actions as a percentage of net revenue each of our major segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in rd expense in fiscal 2006 

selling general and administrative 

total sga expense increased during fiscal 2007 due primarily to additional expense as a result of the acquisition of mercury in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 unfavorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro and additional investments in our sales forces as a percentage of net revenue the ess hps psg and ipg segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease in sga expense during fiscal 2007 while hp software experienced a yearoveryear increase in sga expense 

total sga expense increased slightly during fiscal 2006 as higher bonus accruals and stockbased compensation expenses as well as increased marketing spending were offset in part by savings from expense controls and restructuring actions and favorable currency impacts due to movement of the 

dollar against the euro and the yen as a percentage of net revenue each of our segments experienced a yearoveryear decrease or no change in fiscal 2006 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to amortization expense related to the acquisition of mercury in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 this increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions including the compaq computer corporation compaq acquisition that had reached the end of their amortization period 

the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions including the compaq acquisition that had reached the end of their amortization period which decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related primarily to the acquisitions of scitex vision ltd scitex peregrine systems inc peregrine and outerbay technologies inc outerbay in fiscal year 2006 

for more information on our amortization of purchased intangibles assets see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

inprocess research and development charges 

we record inprocess research and development iprd charges in connection with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations as more fully described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded iprd charges of 190 million 52 million and 2 million respectively related to acquisitions during those years the increase in iprd in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to our acquisition of mercury in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges for fiscal 2007 were 387 million which included 354 million of expenses related to severance and other benefit costs associated with those employees who elected to participate in the 2007 eer and a net charge of 33 million relating to adjustments to our fiscal 2005 2003 2002 and 2001 restructuring programs 

restructuring charges in fiscal year 2006 were 158 million this included a net charge of 233 million related to trueups of severance and other related restructuring charges for all restructuring plans a 6 million termination benefits expense and a 3 million settlement and curtailment loss from our nonus pension plans related to the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan which was approved by our board of directors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 these charges were partially offset by a 46 million settlement gain from the us pension plans a 24 million curtailment gain from the us retiree medical program and a 14 million adjustment to reduce our noncash stockbased compensation expense all related to our fiscal 2005 restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

restructuring charges in fiscal 2005 were 17 billion which included a 16 billion charge for the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan was designed to simplify our structure reduce costs and place greater focus on our customers we initially estimated that 15300 positions would be eliminated in the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan 

subsequent to the initial estimate we reduced the number of total positions to be eliminated to 14985 we had substantially completed eliminating these positions as of october 31 2007 the remaining charge for fiscal 2005 of 109 million was related to severance and related costs associated with the termination of approximately 1450 employees in connection with a restructuring plan approved by our management in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 all employees under this restructuring plan were terminated as of october 31 2005 we paid all of the costs associated with the fiscal 2005 third quarter restructuring plan as of january 31 2007 

for more information on our restructuring charges see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

workforce rebalancing 

as part of our ongoing business operations we incur workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs within certain business segments workforce rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as we continue to optimize our cost structure and are included in our business segment results we expect to incur additional workforce rebalancing costs in the future 

pension curtailments and pension settlements net 

in fiscal 2007 we recognized a net gain on pension curtailments and settlements of 517 million relating primarily to a 542 million curtailment gain associated with a modification to our us defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan this curtailment gain was offset partially by net settlement losses related to our other pension plan design changes 

in conjunction with managements plan to restructure certain of our operations we modified our us retirement programs to align them more closely to industry practice effective january 1 2006 we ceased pension accruals and eliminated eligibility for the subsidized retiree medical program for employees who did not meet defined criteria based on age and years of service as a result we recognized a curtailment gain of 199 million in fiscal 2005 stemming from the elimination of future benefit accruals for the affected employee group 

for more information on our plan design changes see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

interest and other net 

interest and other net decreased by 162 million in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the decrease was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances 

interest and other net increased by 523 million in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 the increase in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from higher net interest income over the prior year related to higher shortterm interest rates in fiscal 2006 net gains from sales of certain real estate properties and lower interest expense due to our lower average debt balances the increase in fiscal 2006 also was attributable to a net 106 million of dispute settlement charge and its related interest charge recorded in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2005 we reached a legal settlement of 141 million in our patent infringement case with intergraph hardware technologies company intergraph and recorded a charge of 116 million related to a crosslicense agreement with intergraph for products shipped in prior years partially offsetting this amount was a 10 million recovery from an individual related to a prior period settlement with the government of canada 

gains losses on investments 

net gains on investment in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from gains on the sale of equity investments which were offset in part by impairment charges on our investment portfolio net losses in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from impairment charges on equity investments in our publiclytraded and privatelyheld investment portfolios partially offsetting these losses were gains attributable to the sale of investments 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 208 138 and 323 in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was related in part to favorable income tax adjustments of 599 million recorded in fiscal 2006 which included net favorable tax adjustments of 565 million to income tax accruals as a result of the settlement of irs examinations of our us income tax returns for fiscal years 1993 to 1998 the reductions to the net income tax accruals for these years related primarily to the resolution of issues with respect to puerto rico manufacturing tax incentives and export tax incentives and other issues involving our nonus operations 

in addition the decrease in the overall tax rate in 2006 from fiscal 2005 was attributable in part to 697 million of income tax expense related to items unique to fiscal 2005 the tax expense was the result primarily of 792 million associated with the repatriation of 145 billion under the american jobs creation act of 2004 jobs act and 76 million related to additional distributions received from foreign subsidiaries these tax expenses were offset in part by tax benefits of 177 million resulting from agreements with the irs and other governmental authorities the jobs act enacted on october 22 2004 provided for a temporary 85 dividend received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a oneyear period the deduction resulted in an approximate 525 federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws we have provided for the united states federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states repatriation could result in additional united states federal income tax payments in future years our intent is that most of the nonus cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash or debt is available in the locations in which it is needed 

financial condition sources and uses of cash 

our total cash and cash equivalents declined approximately 31 to 113 billion at october 31 2007 from 164 billion at october 31 2006 due primarily to increased spending for repurchases of our common stock and investment spending on acquisitions which spending was partially offset by positive operating cash flows and increased borrowings the net 147 billion used for investing and financing activities during fiscal 2007 included 109 billion for share repurchases 68 billion for cash payments in connection with acquisitions and 25 billion for net investments in property plant and equipment partially offsetting these cash expenditures were 31 billion of proceeds relating to the issuance of stock under employee stock plans and a 26 billion net increase in our debt and commercial paper from increased borrowings our cash position remains strong and we believe our cash balances are sufficient to cover cash outlays expected in fiscal 2008 associated with additional stock repurchases acquisitions company bonus payments and other operating cash requirements

key performance metrics 

 days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average net revenue 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing inventory by a 90day average cost of goods sold 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold 

our working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo 

the increase in dso was due primarily to selectively extending payment terms and reducing cash discount rates for early payments for certain customers the decrease in dos was due primarily to more efficient inventory management and higher cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter as a result of increased revenues the decrease in dpo was due primarily to purchasing linearity and reduced payment terms and cash discounts from our major contract manufacturers these changes contributed to the increase in our current year cash conversion cycle compared to the prior year 

2007 compared to 2006 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 17 billion during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the decrease was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable a decrease in accounts payable and higher payments for bonuses earned in fiscal 2006 and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the decease in our cash flow from operations was partially offset by higher earnings in fiscal 2007 

investing activities

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 05 billion during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 the decrease was due primarily to higher net issuance of commercial paper and debt the impact of which was partially offset by increased repurchases of our common stock 

common stock repurchases

as previously discussed we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to support business operations capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends in addition to a level of discretionary 

investments and share repurchases we are able to supplement this nearterm liquidity if necessary with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions 

we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for operations investment plans including acquisitions share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital outstanding debt increased to 82 billion as of october 31 2007 as compared to 52 billion at october 31 2006 bearing weightedaverage interest rates of 52 and 51 respectively shortterm borrowings increased to 32 billion at october 31 2007 from 27 billion at october 31 2006 the increase in shortterm borrowings was due primarily to the net issuance of approximately 19 billion of our commercial paper and notes payable and the reclassification from longterm to shortterm debt including 500 million us dollar global notes that will mature in march 2008 and 50 million series a mediumterm notes that matured and we repaid in december 2007 the increase was offset partially by our repayment of 10 billion global notes in december 2006 and 10 billion global notes in july 2007 during fiscal 2007 we issued 32 billion and repaid 30 billion of commercial paper as of october 31 2007 we had 5 million in total borrowings collateralized by certain financing receivable assets 

the majority of our outstanding debt relates to hpfs we issue debt in order to finance hpfs and as needed for other purposes hpfs has a business model that is assetintensive in nature and therefore we fund hpfs more by debt than we fund our other business segments at october 31 2007 hpfs had approximately 83 billion in net portfolio assets which included short and longterm financing receivables and operating lease assets 

we have the following resources available to obtain shortterm or longterm financings if we need additional liquidity 

 1 approximately 151 million of this amount was recorded as debt as of october 31 2007 the remaining amount was used to satisfy business operational requirements in addition to the financing resources listed above we had additional borrowing activities as described below 

in november 2006 in connection with the mercury acquisition we assumed notes issued by mercury with a face value of 300 million maturing on july 1 2007 and bearing interest at a rate of 

475 per annum the mercury notes as of july 31 2007 we had repurchased or repaid at maturity all of the mercury notes 

in may 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement the 2006 shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec to enable us to offer and sell from time to time in one or more offerings debt securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants on may 23 2006 we issued 10 billion in floating rate global notes due may 22 2009 under the 2006 shelf registration statement that we redeemed in june 2007 

on february 22 2007 we issued an additional 20 billion of global notes under the 2006 shelf registration statement the global notes included 600 million of notes due march 2012 with a floating interest rate equal to the threemonth usd libor plus 011 per annum 900 million of notes due march 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 525 per annum and 500 million of notes due march 2017 with a fixed interest rate of 540 per annum we issued the 600 million notes at par and the 900 million notes and 500 million notes at discounts to par at 99938 and 99694 respectively we used the net proceeds from these note offerings for general corporate purposes including funding the repurchase of the mercury notes as described above and repaying shortterm commercial paper 

on june 12 2007 we issued an additional 20 billion of global notes under the 2006 shelf registration statement the global notes included 10 billion of notes due june 2009 with a floating interest rate equal to the threemonth usd libor plus 001 per annum and 10 billion of notes due june 2010 with a floating interest rate equal to the threemonth usd libor plus 006 per annum we issued these global notes at par we used the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes including the redemption of the floating rate global notes due may 22 2009 as described above in june 2007 and the repayment of shortterm commercial paper 

on december 17 2007 we repaid 50 million series a mediumterm notes due december 2007 at maturity 

we have a 30 billion us credit facility expiring in may 2012 this credit facility is a senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangement that we put in place primarily to support our us commercial paper program our ability to have a us commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the 30 billion committed credit facility is subject to a number of factors including liquidity conditions and business performance 

our credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them standard  poors ratings services moodys investors service and fitch ratings currently rate our senior unsecured longterm debt a a2 and a and our shortterm debt a1 prime1 and f1 respectively we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt however a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities also a downgrade in our credit rating could limit our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs if this occurs we would seek alternative sources of funding including through drawdowns under our credit facility or the issuance of notes under our existing shelf registration statements and our euro mediumterm note programme 

we have revolving trade receivablesbased facilities permitting us to sell certain trade receivables to third parties on a nonrecourse basis the aggregate maximum capacity under these programs was approximately 525 million as of october 31 2007 we sold approximately 22 billion of trade 

receivables during fiscal 2007 as of october 31 2007 we had approximately 117 million available under these programs 

contractual obligations 

the impact that we expect our contractual obligations as of october 31 2007 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 

 1 amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts included in our longterm debt are approximately 48 million of capital lease obligations that are secured by certain equipment 2 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items funding commitments 

during fiscal 2007 we made approximately 133 million of contributions to nonus pension plans paid 16 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants and paid 58 million to cover benefit claims under postretirement benefit plans in addition we used 108 million of cash to fund the distribution and subsequent transfer of accrued pension benefits from the us excess benefit plan to the us executive deferred compensation plan for the terminated vested plan participants in fiscal 2008 we expect to contribute approximately 145 million to our pension plans and approximately 15 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants we also expect to pay approximately 80 million to cover benefit claims for our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2008 our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government and funding and taxing authorities we expect to use contributions made to the postretirement benefit plans primarily for the payment of retiree health claims incurred during the fiscal year 

in conjunction with our february 2007 announcement to modify our us defined benefit pension plan and our pre2003 retiree medical program we offered eligible affected employees an option to participate in the 2007 eer we funded the cash expenditures associated with the 2007 eer primarily by using available us pension plan assets we made no incremental pension contributions to the pension plan stemming from the 2007 eer 

we have implemented bonus programs that are designed to reward our employees upon achievement of annual performance objectives we calculate bonuses based on a formula with targets that are set at the beginning of each fiscal year our board of directors approves both the formula and the targets 

in fiscal 2007 we outperformed against our targets which will result in a significant bonus payout during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and a corresponding reduction of cash flow from operations in that quarter we accrued and expensed this bonus as it was earned throughout fiscal 2007 

as a result of our approved restructuring plans we expect future cash expenditures of 173 million which we recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at october 31 2007 we expect to make cash payments of approximately 123 million in fiscal 2008 and the majority of the remaining 50 million through 2014 

pending and subsequent acquisitions 

for pending acquisitions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of october 31 2007 we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spes 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the thirdparty to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments we have made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant to our operations for fiscal 2007 were the euro the japanese yen and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures we recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currencydenominated exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2007 and 2006 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2007 and 2006 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of 104 million at both october 31 2007 and october 31 2006 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then typically use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for 

floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2007 and 2006 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investment instruments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables the discount rates we used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2007 and 2006 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investment instruments and financing receivables net of interest rate swap positions of 17 million at october 31 2007 and 19 million at october 31 2006 

equity price risk 

we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities which had an estimated fair value of 9 million at october 31 2007 and 36 million at october 31 2006 we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of the equity investment exceeds its fair value and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value generally we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities however we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of 3 million at october 31 2007 and 11 million at october 31 2006 the aggregate cost of privatelyheld companies and other investments was 533 million at october 31 2007 and 362 million at october 31 2006

strategy and segment overview

   we provide a broad mix of products across a variety of product segments and
across customer categories ranging from large multinational enterprises to
individual consumers we seek to be the category leader with respect to each of
the specific products and categories in which we compete and to expand actively
into new and adjacent markets accordingly in fiscal 2001 we focused on
strengthening and enhancing each of our segments as described further below

   at the same time that we focus on individual offerings we seek to utilize
the depth and breadth of our products and services as well as our expertise in
working with complementary technology providers in order to provide integrated
solutions that address new and emerging market demands and offer new customer
experiences this solutiondriven approach is focused on two converging paths
the first path is the development of nextgeneration devicesprinters pcs
handhelds notebooks and new devices that will take advantage of the
convergence of technology in addition to their more traditional functions
these devices feature embedded technology that allows them to work in
conjunction with other devices whether wireless or wired to provide or access
eservices for example the use of personal digital assistants pdas to
access the internet to complete transactions and print information requires
that separate devices work together the second path is the development of a
dynamic flexible reliable infrastructure that can be accessed and utilized in
more ways by the variety of devices discussed above we believe that as
infrastructure and access devices evolve and increase in their interdependence
they will create a more dynamic flexible and interconnected world

   following are discussions of our principal business segments and key
activities in these segments during fiscal 2001

the past year we have taken several actions to increase our offerings in this
area we acquired storageapps inc a provider of virtualization software that
allows enterprises to support multivendor networks the acquisition allows us
to focus increasingly on storage virtualization as a key technology
recognizing that customers do not want to be locked into a proprietary storage
system in addition we solidified our product offerings by adding the va7100
and va7400 midrange disc arrays to our product line we also renewed our
partnership with hitachi data systems for an additional three years allowing

sales and marketing

   we continue to manage our business and report our financial results based on
our three principal business segments described above the marketing and
selling of our products and services however are organized separately into
three main customerfacing organizations a consumer business organization
cbo a business customer organization bco and an hp services
organization hps hps was created in fiscal 2001 in order to improve our
marketing and selling efforts for services

   cbo contains all of our consumerrelated marketing and selling activities
consolidated into a single functional unit and bco represents the
consolidation of all of hps business and enterpriserelated marketing and
selling activities into a single functional unit by consolidating around
customer groups we have improved our customer relationships by providing a
single main point of contact to the customer eliminating redundant sales
efforts better leveraging crossselling opportunities with customers and
better coordinating feedback and knowledgecapture of customer requirements and
trends for our development of crossproduct solutions this feedback and
knowledge is continuously incorporated into planning decisions supported by our
productgeneration organizations such as imaging and printing systems and
computing systems this new marketing structure enables us to leverage our core
assets better to deliver worldclass technology services and solutions and a
worldclass customer experience

   because of the distinct nature of selling services hps oversees the
marketing and selling activities of our it services segment this organization
coordinates with bco due to the existence of enterprise customers in the two
groups providing us with both the flexibility of distinct sales and marketing
organizations to act independently and the benefits of coordination

   consumer business organization  cbo is responsible for marketing and
supplying our consumer products around the world cbo is organized by product
offerings including home pcs pavilion desktop pc products printer hardware
and supplies deskjet and allinone inkjet printers ink cartridges and
media imaging scanjet scanners digital cameras personal appliances
jornada pdas cd writers dvdrw drives by integrating the marketing for all
consumer products into a single organization we have reduced redundancies and
better leveraged opportunities for crosscategory consumer product marketing

   we have adopted a blended channel strategy for consumer product distribution
in the united states that includes sales through approximately 20000
thirdparty retail locations and direct sales through hpshoppingcom a
whollyowned subsidiary that supports online sales

   key product development initiatives in fiscal 2001 included an increased
focus on consumeroriented industrial design providing new and additional
consumer eserviceseither independently or in conjunction with thirdparty
partnersand a strong crossproduct category marketing focus on imaging

   sales through cbo are derived through reseller channels including
retailers dealers and original equipment manufacturers as well as through
direct sales and distribution to customers over the internet

   business customer organization  bco is responsible for marketing and
delivering products and solutions to all of our business and enterprise
customers bcos customers include small and medium businesses as well as
global enterprises including telecommunications service providers internet
service providers and academic

scientific and government institutions bco is charged with developing a
comprehensive understanding of hps business customers needs and translating
this understanding into delivering worldclass products solutions and customer
experience throughout the customer lifecycle accordingly bco markets
products services and solutions that constitute either individual products and
services or unique combinations of offerings from imaging and printing systems
laserjet printer hardware and supplies computing systems commercial desktop
pcs notebook pcs workstations servers storage software and it services
financing

   sales through bco result from the efforts of our business customer sales
force which includes direct field sales representatives indirect sales ie
commercial channels hp consultants presales technical personnel and
administrative support staff bcos direct sales force is divided into
specialty product and service representatives such as for servers storage
software and services and teams assigned to corporate accounts representing
all of our product and service categories

   hp services organization  hps is responsible for marketing and delivering
information technology services to all of our business and enterprise
customers hps is charged with developing a comprehensive understanding of the
customer needs for our support consulting and outsourcing services and
translating this understanding into delivering worldclass services hps also
is charged with understanding the customerloyalty and crossselling
opportunities so that we can better sell services to our bco customers as well
as better sell our bco products and solutions to services customers including
customers of our multivendor support services

   over the past year cbo bco and hps shared in several key developments in
our sales and marketing efforts besides creating hps in fiscal 2001 we
completed the simplification of our product line structure which reduced our
number of product categories from 83 to 17 this simplification is designed to
eliminate customer confusion and increase our focus on key product lines we
also implemented a new channel engagement program in fiscal 2001 that we have
called hard deck this program is designed to clarify the roles and
responsibilities for us and our channel partners in order to improve our
channel relationships and make our selling model more efficient

international

   we maintain operations in more than 120 countries worldwide and sell into
additional geographies through various representatives and distributors we
believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on business and technical
expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations and
revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an
opportunity to exploit new markets for maturing products in addition we
believe that in the future technology companies will have to develop products
and sales models that are able to target developing countries moreover we
believe that our broad geographic presence and our einclusion program which
is focused on developing products and business models that will bring
technology to developing countries will give us a solid base to build upon for
future growth

   a summary of our net revenue and net property plant and equipment by
geographic area is set forth in note 18 to the consolidated financial
statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference more than half
of our overall net revenue comes from outside of the united states in the last
three fiscal years more than threefourths of this international revenue was
derived from europe and the asia pacific region a majority of our net revenue
originating outside the united states was from customers other than foreign
governments

research and development

   the process of developing new hightechnology products and solutions is
inherently complex and uncertain it requires among other things innovation
and accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging
technological trends without the introduction of new products services and
enhancements our products and services are likely to become technologically
obsolete over time in which case revenue would be materially and adversely
affected new products and services if and when introduced may not achieve
market acceptance after the products and services are developed we must
quickly manufacture and deliver such products and services in sufficient
volumes at acceptable costs to meet demand

   hewlettpackard laboratories also known as hp labs together with the
various research and development groups within the three principal business
segments are responsible for our total research and development efforts

   expenditures for research and development in fiscal 2001 including hp labs
and the three principal business segments were 27 billion these
expenditures were 26 billion in fiscal 2000 and 24 billion in fiscal 1999
in fiscal 2001 total research and development expenditures were 59 of net
revenue compared to 54 in fiscal 2000 and 58 in fiscal 1999

   we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and
development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of
innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our
competitive position

patents

   our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions
and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or to
give us a competitive advantage while we believe that our patents and
applications have value in general no single patent is in itself essential to
us as a whole or any of our principal business segments in addition any of
our proprietary rights could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may
not provide significant competitive advantages

backlog

   we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business
prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from shelf inventories
the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of net revenue
related to our service and support business therefore we believe that backlog
information is not material to an understanding of our business

competition

   we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity
our competitors are numerous ranging from some of the worlds largest
corporations to many relatively small and highly specialized firms we compete
primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability
brand distribution and customer service and support our reputation the ease
of use of our products the ready availability of multiple software
applications our internet infrastructure offering and our customer training
services and support are also important competitive factors

   the markets for each of our three principal business segments are
characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with
longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms
product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new
products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services
and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition
we compete with many of our current and potential partners the successful
management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our
future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust
prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive and thus
effectively manage financial returns with correspondingly reduced gross margins

                                      9

page

   on an overall basis we are among the largest usbased companies offering
our range of generalpurpose computers and personalinformation imaging and
printing products for industrial scientific and business applications and
information technology services we are the leader or among the leaders in each
of our principal business segments

    the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described
below

   imaging and printing systems  the markets for printer hardware and
associated supplies are highly competitive especially with respect to pricing
and the introduction of new products and features our key competitors in this
segment include xerox corporation lexmark international group inc seiko
epson corporation sony corporation of america sony and canon usa inc we
are the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer
hardware printing supplies and scanning devices we believe that our brand
recognition quality reputation breadth of product offering and large customer
base are important competitive advantages we and our competitors continue to
develop and market new and innovative products at competitive prices and at
any given time may set new market standards for quality speed and function
in recent years we and our principal competitors have regularly lowered prices
on printer hardware to reach new customers and add customer value if these
pressures are not mitigated by cost and expense reductions our ability to
maintain or build market share profitably could be adversely affected in
addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for our supplies are available
from independent suppliers and although generally offering lower print
quality may be offered at lower prices and put pressure on our supplies
business two important areas for our growth include new business opportunities
in digital cameras and photo printers within our imaging business and digital
presses in our digital publishing business while we encounter competitors
whose current market share is greater than ours such as sony in cameras and
heidelberger druckmaschinen aktiengesellschaft heidelberg in publishing we
believe we will provide important new contributions in both the home and
publishing environments by providing comprehensive solutions that include data
management storage integrated system capabilities security authentication
and easeofuse

   computing systems  the areas in which the computing systems segment
operates are intensely competitive characterized by rapid and ongoing
technological innovation and price reductions our competitors are some of the
largest most successful companies in the world they range from broad
solutions providers such as international business machines corporation to more
focused competitors such as emc corporation in storage dell computer
corporation in personal computers and servers and sun microsystems inc in
servers compaq computer corporation is also a competitor on both focused and
broadbased levels broadbased solutions providers benefit from their existing
customer base and the breadth of their product offerings while more focused
competitors are able to concentrate their efforts on providing the most
competitive product and also may contribute to pricing pressures within a
product category such as pcs we believe that our important competitive
advantages in this segment include our broad range of server storage and
software products and our significant intellectual property portfolio and
research and development capabilities which will contribute to further
enhancements of our product offerings

   it services  the principal areas in which it services competes are customer
support consulting outsourcing and financing the support and consulting
markets have been under significant pressure as customers scrutinize their it
spending in response to the global economic downturn however the downturn
also has contributed to increased use of outsourcing services as customers
attempt to reduce their it costs and focus their resources on their core
businesses our key competitors in this segment include the service
organizations of certain companies such as ibm global services and compaq
global services and independent service firms such as eds corporation and
computer sciences corporation we also compete with consulting firms such as
accenture llp capgeminiernst  young and pricewaterhousecoopers llp many of
these competitors are able to offer a wide range of services through a global
network of service providers which may be larger than our own and some of our
competitors enjoy significant brand recognition we believe that our
competitive advantages in this segment include our worldclass delivery
organization with over 600 offices in 120 countries for support and nine
dedicated worldwide service and internet data centers for outsourcing an
additional advantage in our support business is our delivery technology which
consists of remote and onsite diagnostic

                                      10

tools and technologies as well as selfsupport portals our competitive
advantage in consulting centers around our expertise in it infrastructure and
in certain industryspecific markets and solution areas the industry areas of
expertise are mainly financial services telecommunications and manufacturing
while the solution areas of expertise include crm and ecommerce in our
financing business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm
global financing banks and financial institutions we believe our competitive
advantage in this business is our ability to finance products services or
total solutions

materials

   our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors
electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic
resins and sheet metal although we believe that the materials and supplies
necessary for our manufacturing operations are presently available in the
quantities required we sometimes experience a short supply of certain
component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts

   we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial
number of vendors for many of our products we have existing alternate sources
of supply or such sources are readily available however we do rely on sole
sources for laser printer engines and parts for products with short life cycles
although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations we also
have a dependency upon intel corporation as a supplier of processors and static
ram and microsoft corporation for various software products however we
believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide
dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage hp
relative to competitors in addition we have engaged manufacturers in taiwan
for the production of notebook computers while these relationships and
dependencies have not resulted in material disruptions in the past natural
disasters in taiwan have caused temporary disruptions in communications and
supplies which did not have a material impact on our results of operations

environment

   certain of our operations involve the use of substances regulated under
various federal state and international laws governing the environment it is
our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites
inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulations
imposed by local governments the liability for environmental remediation and
related costs is accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated environmental costs are presently not material to our
operations or financial position

employees

   hp had approximately 86200 employees worldwide as of october 31 2001

   information regarding our executive officers is set forth in part iii









item 2  properties

   the principal executive offices of hp are located at 3000 hanover street
palo alto california 94304 usa as of october 31 2001 we owned or leased a
total of approximately 439 million square feet of space worldwide including
04 million square feet currently occupied by agilent technologies inc we
believe that our existing properties are in good condition and suitable for the
conduct of our business

   our plants are equipped with machinery most of which is owned and is in
part developed by us to meet the special requirements for manufacturing
computers peripherals and systems at the end of fiscal 2001 we were
productively utilizing the vast majority of the space in our facilities while
actively disposing of space determined to be excess

   we anticipate that most of the capital necessary for expansion will continue
to be obtained from internally generated funds investment in new property
plant and equipment from continuing operations amounted to 15 billion in
fiscal 2001 17 billion in fiscal 2000 and 11 billion in fiscal 1999

                                      11

   as of october 31 2001 our sales and support operations occupied
approximately 159 million square feet of which approximately 58 million
square feet were located within the united states we own 34 of the space used
for sales and support activities and lease the remaining 66

   our manufacturing plants research and development facilities and warehouse
and administrative facilities occupied approximately 280 million square feet
of which approximately 198 million square feet were located within the united
states we own 67 of our manufacturing research and development warehouse
and administrative space and lease the remaining 33 none of the property we
own is held subject to any major encumbrances

   as indicated above we have three principal business segments imaging and
printing systems computing systems and it services because of the
interrelation of these three segments substantially all of the properties are
used at least in part by each of these segments and we retain the flexibility
to use each of the properties in whole or in part for each of the segments

pending or threatened litigation

   on or about march 23 1998 an individual filed a lawsuit against hp in
federal court in california claiming hps laserjet printers infringe his us
patent 5424780 which he asserts covers portions of the resolution
enhancement technology employed in these printers hp believes based on an
opinion from outside counsel that it does not infringe the patent hp has held
discussions with the plaintiff but has not resolved the matter hp filed a
lawsuit to obtain a ruling that it does not infringe thereafter the us
patent office agreed to reexamine the patent based on prior art identified by
hp the litigation is stayed pending the outcome of the patent office
reexamination

   on or about july 31 2000 hp was sued in an unfair business practices
consumer class action filed by three residents of san bernardino california in
federal court in california the three claim to have purchased different models
of hp inkjet printers over the past three years this action alleges that hp
printers were sold with halffull or economy ink cartridges instead of full
cartridges and that hps advertising packaging and marketing representations
for the printers led the plaintiffs to believe they would receive full
cartridges it is the basic contention of this action that hps advertising and
failure to advise specifically that economy cartridges were included
constitute false and misleading conduct in violation of both the california
consumer legal remedies

                 financial condition and results of operations

   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this
document

   our consolidated financial statements for all periods present the businesses
of agilent technologies as a discontinued operation through the spinoff date
of june 2 2000 unless otherwise indicated the following discussion relates
to hps continuing operations

results of operations

overview

   the following is a summary of operating results at the hp consolidated
level this discussion is followed by a more detailed discussion of operating
results by segment product category fluctuations highlighted at the
consolidated level are more fully explained in the segment discussion

net revenue

   net revenue declined 7 in fiscal 2001 to 452 billion following growth of
15 in fiscal 2000 us revenue in 2001 declined 13 to 188 billion while
international revenue in 2001 decreased 3 overall to 264 billion the global
economic downturn contributed significantly to the decline in both us and
international revenue in 2001 in fiscal 2000 us revenue increased 14 and
international revenue increased 16 due largely to economic improvement in
asia on a foreign currencyadjusted basis net revenue declined 3 year over
year for hp as a whole in fiscal 2001 while net revenue increased 17 on a
foreign currencyadjusted basis in fiscal 2000 the majority of the foreign
currency effect in both years was due to the weakening of the euro partially
offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen in 2000

   in fiscal 2001 net revenue for the computing systems business segment
decreased 14 and declined 5 for the imaging and printing systems segment net
revenue for it services grew 6 in 2001 of the overall 7 net revenue decline
for fiscal 2001 on a weighted basis printer hardware represented 4 percentage
points of the decline while commercial pcs desktop pcs and notebook pcs and
home pcs each accounted for approximately 15 percentage points of the decline
a decrease in unixr and pc servers revenue also contributed slightly to the
yearoveryear revenue decline however the decrease in server revenue was
offset for the most part by revenue growth in printer supplies the declines
in the printer hardware and pc businesses were due primarily to decreases in
volume as a result of the economic slowdown in fiscal 2001 a shift in sales
mix into the sub150 printer market also contributed to the decrease in
printer hardware revenue in addition ongoing competitive pricing pressures
affected revenue performance in many of our product categories particularly
for commercial and home pcs and printer hardware

   on a segment basis net revenue for computing systems increased 19 in
fiscal 2000 while revenue for it services grew 13 and imaging and printing
systems grew 10 on a weighted basis home pcs and printer supplies each
accounted for 4 percentage points of the overall 15 increase while commercial
pcs represented 2 percentage points of growth the remainder of the increase in
fiscal 2000 revenue consisted of growth across many product categories
including imaging unixr and pc servers customer support services
outsourcing and our technology financing business growth in the pc business
was almost entirely attributable to strong unit sales particularly in home and
notebook pcs but this growth was moderated by a competitive pricing
environment the unit growth in home and notebook pcs was driven by favorable
acceptance of new products including our newly introduced retail notebook
line increased volume in our printer supplies business was fueled by continued
expansion of the printer hardware installed base

gross margin

   gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 260 in fiscal 2001
compared to 283 in fiscal 2000 and 295 in fiscal 1999 the 23 percentage
point decrease in the gross margin ratio in fiscal 2001 resulted from declines
across all of hps business segments while the 12 percentage point decline in
fiscal 2000 was mainly attributable to a decrease in the computing systems
segment overall in fiscal 2001 gross margins were negatively impacted by a
significant decline in sales volumes across many product categories resulting
from the global economic downturn and increased inventoryrelated charges in
response to this downturn the higher inventoryrelated charges which
represented 04 percentage points of the gross margin decline mainly impacted
our inkjet imaging and personal appliances businesses

   we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date
which includes a review of among other factors demand requirements product
lifecycle and product development plans and quality issues based on this
analysis we record adjustments when appropriate to reflect inventory at net
realizable value

   of the 23 percentage point decline in gross margin for fiscal 2001 on a
weighted basis printer hardware and imaging each accounted for one percentage
point of the decline in addition gross margins for unixr and pc servers and
technology financing decreased slightly in fiscal 2001 these declines were
partially offset by an increase of one percentage point for printer supplies on
a weighted basis printer hardware and imaging were unfavorably impacted by a
continuing shift to lowerpriced products in response to customer demand in
addition to the inventory writedowns discussed above of the 12 percentage
point decline in gross margin for fiscal 2000 home pcs and commercial pcs were
the main drivers although supplies experienced a gross margin improvement
gross margins in our pc business were unfavorably impacted by higher memory
costs as well as a mix shift to lowermargin products and ongoing competitive
pricing pressures

operating expenses

  research and development

   research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 59 in
fiscal 2001 compared to 54 in fiscal 2000 and 58 in fiscal 1999 research
and development expense in dollars grew 1 in fiscal 2001 and 8 in fiscal
2000 after adjusting for 35 million of inprocess research and development
writeoffs related to acquisitions recorded in fiscal 2001 research and
development expense for 2001 was flat compared to fiscal 2000 research and
development expense grew 10 in the computing systems segment reflecting
investments related to server software and storage products however declines
in research and development spending of 8 in it services and 3 in imaging and
printing systems fully offset this growth during the year as a result of
focused spending in key areas and expense reductions in less strategic
programs in addition companywide actions taken by management throughout the
year to control expenses including the restructuring

                    managements discussion and analysis of
           financial condition and results of operations continued

actions discussed below moderated research and development expense growth in
fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2000 the growth in research and development expense was
due primarily to an increase in spending on the design and development of new
technologies in both the computing systems and imaging and printing systems
segments

  selling general and administrative

   selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue
was 161 in fiscal 2001 compared to 145 in fiscal 2000 and 147 in fiscal
1999 selling general and administrative expense in dollars increased 3 in
fiscal 2001 and 13 in fiscal 2000 the increase in selling general and
administrative expense for fiscal 2001 resulted substantially from a 172
million increase in bad debt reserves and writeoffs in our financing portfolio
due to weakened economic conditions

   we evaluate the collectibility of our trade and financing receivables based
on a combination of factors when we become aware of a specific customers
inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or
financial position we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the
related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible we also
record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of
factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and
historical experience if circumstances related to specific customers change
our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further reduced

   overall companywide actions taken by management throughout the year to
control expenses including the restructuring actions discussed below
moderated selling general and administrative expense growth in fiscal 2001
the growth in selling general and administrative expense in fiscal 2000 was
attributable to increased selling costs to support planned business expansion
and increased marketing expenses from the introduction of new products and to
support our eservices strategy and corporate branding initiative

  restructuring charges

   in fiscal 2001 management approved restructuring actions to respond to the
global economic downturn and to improve our cost structure by streamlining
operations and prioritizing resources in strategic areas of our business we
recorded a restructuring charge of 384 million to reflect these actions this
charge consisted of severance and other employee benefits related to the
planned termination of approximately 7500 employees worldwide across many
regions business functions and job classes as well as costs related to the
consolidation of excess facilities included as an offset to this charge was
38 million of related net pension and postretirement settlement and
curtailment gains as of october 31 2001 5700 employees were terminated and
we had paid out 238 million of the accrued costs we also made additional
payments of 26 million in fiscal 2001 related to restructuring charges accrued
in fiscal 2000 we expect to pay out the remainder of the accrual in fiscal
2002 these workforce reduction programs are expected to result in an
annualized cost savings of approximately 500 million

   in fiscal 2000 management approved an enhanced early retirement eer
program designed to balance the workforce based on our longterm business
strategy we offered approximately 2500 us employees the opportunity to
retire early and receive an enhanced payout and approximately 1300 employees
accepted the offer accordingly we recorded a restructuring charge of 71
million consisting of 100 million of severance and other employee benefits
offset by 29 million of related pension and postretirement settlement and
curtailment gains in addition to the eer program we incurred 31 million of
other restructuring charges during fiscal 2000 related to various site
shutdowns resulting from strategic management decisions in fiscal 2000 we
made payments of 98 million related to the restructuring charges accrued
during the year of which 95 million was paid through hps pension plan based
on an amendment to the plan

interest and other net

   interest and other net decreased 185 million in fiscal 2001 and increased
11 million in fiscal 2000 the decline in interest and other net for fiscal
2001 was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income due to lower
interest rates on cash and investments and lower average cash and investment
balances in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 most of the remainder of the
decline was due to an increase in interest expense as a result of higher
average debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates the increase
in fiscal 2000 was due mainly to an increase in interest income due to higher
average cash and investment balances during fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

net investment losses gains

   hp reported net investment losses of 455 million in fiscal 2001 compared to
net investment gains of 41 million in fiscal 2000 and net investment gains of
31 million in fiscal 1999

   our investment portfolio includes equity and debt investments in public and
privatelyheld emerging technology companies many of these emerging technology
companies are still in the startup or development stage our investments in
these companies are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies
or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and
may never develop we monitor our investment portfolio for impairment on a
periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds
its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be
otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for
the investment is established fair values for investments in public companies
are determined using quoted market prices fair values for investments in
privatelyheld companies are estimated based upon one or more of the following
pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information and
current market rates liquidation values the values of recent rounds of
financing or quoted market prices of comparable public companies in order to
determine whether a decline in value is otherthantemporary hp evaluates
among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been
less than carrying value the financial condition of and business outlook for
the company including key operational and cash flow metrics current market
conditions and future trends in the companys industry and the companys
relative competitive position within the industry and our intent and ability
to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value

   due to the economic downturn the decline in value of certain investments in
emerging technology companies was determined to be otherthantemporary
accordingly we recorded impairment losses of 471 million on our investments
in both public and private emerging technology companies in fiscal 2001 this
amount was offset by 16 million of realized gains on the sale of equity
securities as of october 31 2001 the carrying value of the portion of our
remaining investment portfolio related to emerging technology companies was
243 million depending on market conditions we may incur additional charges
on our investment portfolio in the future

   in fiscal 2000 hp recorded 41 million of net gains on investments
representing gains on sales of equity investments of 104 million partially
offset by impairment losses of 63 million the net investment gains of 31
million in fiscal 1999 resulted from realized gains on the sale of equity
securities

litigation settlement

   on june 4 2001 hp and pitney bowes inc pitney bowes announced that
they had entered into agreements that resolved all pending patent litigation
between the parties without admission of infringement and in connection
therewith hp paid pitney bowes 400 million in cash on june 7 2001 for

losses gains on divestitures

   in fiscal 2001 the net loss from divestitures was 53 million consisting
of a 131 million loss on the sale of our verifone inc subsidiary offset by
a gain of 78 million on the sale of hps remaining interest in a joint venture
to the other joint owner in fiscal 2000 the net gain from divestitures was
203 million consisting of the gains on the sale of nonstrategic businesses
as well as the gain from the sale of part of hps interest in the same joint
venture to the other joint owner

earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary item cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle and taxes

   as reported earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary item
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and taxes decreased 85 to
702 million in 2001 compared to a 10 increase to 46 billion in fiscal
2000 as a percentage of net revenue earnings from continuing operations
before extraordinary item cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
and taxes was 16 in fiscal 2001 compared to 95 in fiscal 2000 and 99 in
fiscal 1999 the significant decline in 2001 was driven by the global economic
downturn as well as 384 million of restructuring charges 455 million of net
investment losses a 400 million charge for litigation settlement and 53
million of net losses on divestitures

provision for taxes

   hps effective tax rate from continuing operations was 11 in fiscal 2001
23 in fiscal 2000 and 26 in fiscal 1999 the yearoveryear decreases were
primarily the result of changes in the mix of our pretax earnings in various
tax jurisdictions throughout the world the mix of the pretax earnings in
fiscal 2001 was significantly impacted by 384 million of restructuring
charges 455 million of net investment losses a 400 million charge for
litigation settlement and 53 million of net losses on divestitures all on a
pretax basis which were incurred primarily in highertax jurisdictions

net earnings from discontinued operations

   net earnings from discontinued operations were 136 million for fiscal 2000
in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 the cumulative net earnings of agilent
technologies since the july 31 1999 measurement date began to exceed the total
estimated net costs to effect the spinoff of the 136 million net earnings
of agilent technologies for the period from the july 31 1999 measurement date
through the june 2 2000 spinoff date totaled 287 million net of related tax
expense of 174 million and the net costs to effect the spinoff were 151
million net of related tax benefit of 23 million net earnings from
discontinued operations of 387 million for fiscal 1999 consisted only of the
net earnings of agilent technologies see note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements in item 8 for further discussion

extraordinary item

   in december 2000 the board of directors authorized a repurchase program for
hps zerocoupon subordinated convertible notes under the repurchase program
we may repurchase the notes from time to time at varying prices in fiscal
2001 we repurchased 12 billion in face value of the notes with a book value
of 729 million resulting in an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment
of debt of 56 million net of related taxes of 33 million

   imaging and printing systems net revenue declined 5 in fiscal 2001
following growth of 10 in fiscal 2000 on a foreign currencyadjusted basis
net revenue declined 2 in 2001 and increased 11 in 2000 of the overall 5
net revenue decrease for fiscal 2001 on a weighted basis inkjet and laserjet
printer hardware revenue represented 9 percentage points of the decline
partially offset by 3 percentage points of growth in printer supplies and 1
percentage point of growth in imaging devices overall slowing markets across
all product categories and geographic regions due to the economic downturn
negatively impacted revenue in 2001 of the segments overall 10 revenue
increase for fiscal 2000 on a weighted basis printer supplies contributed
8 percentage points and imaging devices accounted for 3 percentage points of
growth partially offset by a decline in printer hardware sales of 2 percentage
points

   half of the printer hardware net revenue decline in fiscal 2001 was
attributable to a decrease in average selling prices driven by a continuing
demand shift to lowerpriced printer products particularly into the sub150
printer hardware market and a competitive pricing environment the remainder
of the printer hardware revenue decline reflected a drop in units of
approximately 10 due mainly to softening in both the consumer and business
markets partially offsetting this decline in printer hardware revenue was
growth in printer supplies and imaging products half of the net revenue growth
for printer supplies reflected a rise in volumes due to continued expansion of
the printer hardware installed base while the remaining growth resulted
primarily from higher average selling prices net revenue growth in imaging was
driven primarily by an increase in unit sales for the product category
moderated by growing demand for lowerpriced products and competitive pricing
the revenue growth for both supplies and imaging devices in fiscal 2001 was
dampened by the economic downturn

   net revenue growth for printer supplies in fiscal 2000 was attributable to
increased volumes due mainly to expansion of the printer hardware installed
base revenue growth in imaging devices was fueled by excellent unit growth
from newly introduced products within the category partially offset by planned
pricing declines in allin

one products and a shift in sales mix to lowerpriced scanners softening
demand in the printer hardware market as well as shifts to lowerpriced
products in this category moderated the segments net revenue growth in 2000

   earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 102 in fiscal
2001 compared to 130 in fiscal 2000 and 127 in fiscal 1999 a decline in
gross margin accounted for 25 points of the 28 percentage point decrease in
the earnings from operations ratio in 2001 while the remaining decline was due
to a slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue
within the 25 percentage point gross margin decline gross margins for printer
hardware and imaging products collectively dropped 46 percentage points on a
weighted basis the majority of this gross margin decrease resulted from the
continued shift in sales mix to lowerpriced products as noted above gross
margins in these categories were further impacted unfavorably by an increase in
inventoryrelated reserves and charges in our inkjet and imaging businesses and
charges related to the cancellation of planned production line expansion in our
inkjet business that occurred in response to weakened economic conditions
these incremental reserves and charges totaled 214 million for fiscal 2001
partially offsetting the 46 point gross margin decline in printer hardware and
imaging on a weighted basis were gross margin improvements of approximately
10 percentage point from lower component costs due to a weaker japanese yen
and approximately 08 percentage points due to supplies which typically have
gross margins that exceed the segment average becoming a larger portion of the
segments product mix although operating expenses decreased in total
operating expense as a percentage of net revenue for the segment increased by
03 percentage points compared to the prior year as the decrease in revenues
exceeded the rate of decrease in operating expenses

   in fiscal 2000 the increase of 03 percentage points in the earnings from
operations ratio consisted of a 12 percentage point improvement in operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by a 09 percentage
point decline in the overall segment gross margin the decline in the operating
expense ratio reflected controlled expense management the gross margin decline
was attributable to a shift toward lowerpriced printers and imaging devices
as well as higher component costs related to a stronger japanese yen these
factors which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 27 percentage points on a
weighted basis were offset in part by a 20 percentage point margin
improvement due to economies of scale from increased production levels of
printer supplies

2000 net revenues in the pc business were impacted by declining average
selling prices as a result of decreasing component costs which are generally
passed on to the customer and competitive pricing pressures

   the decline in fiscal 2001 net revenue within the pc business resulted from
significant decreases in commercial desktop pcs and home pcs offset in part by
growth in notebook pcs the revenue decline in commercial desktop pcs almost
equally reflected a decrease in volumes and an ongoing decrease in average
selling prices commercial desktop pc unit sales declined approximately 11 in
2001 while average selling prices declined approximately 10 a decrease in
volumes of approximately 14 accounted for most of the home pc revenue decline
while an approximate 4 decline in average selling prices also contributed to
the decrease in this product category the decline in unit sales in both
commercial desktop pcs and home pcs reflected the effects of the economic
slowdown in fiscal 2001 in addition a continued shift toward mobile computing
dampened growth in commercial desktop pcs and home pc revenue was unfavorably
impacted by market saturation that began late in fiscal 2000 notebook pc
revenue increased mainly as a result of higher unit sales largely as a result
of the previously noted shift toward mobile computing however this growth was
moderated by an ongoing decline in average selling prices more than
threefourths of the decrease in unixr server net revenue was due primarily
to weakness in midrange servers which were unfavorably impacted by the
enterprise market slowdown and competitive pricing pressures the unixr
server revenue decline also resulted from a decrease in highend server
revenue despite increasing sales of our new superdome server in the last half
of fiscal 2001 highend server net revenue was down for the fiscal year due to
the slowdown in enterprise capital spending and because superdome did not begin
shipping in volume until january 2001 the decline in highend server revenue
in fiscal 2001 was entirely offset by growth in the lowend category the pc
server net revenue decline was driven by a sales mix shift to lowend products
ongoing competitive pricing pressures and delayed product launches in 2001
revenue from workstations decreased as a result of the decline in it spending
and overall weakness in the unixr sector

   in fiscal 2000 home pc net revenue growth reflected very strong unit sales
moderated by lower average selling prices home pc volumes increased
approximately 97 while average selling prices declined approximately 11 in
2000 unit growth in home pcs was driven by favorable acceptance of new
products and was aided by the exit of two major competitors from the retail
market revenue growth in notebook pcs was due to an increase in volumes
slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices notebook pc unit sales
increased approximately 199 while average selling prices decreased
approximately 18 notebook pc volumes in 2000 benefited from the introduction
of our retail notebook line as well as continued strong sales of the commercial
portfolio growth in lowend and midrange unixr servers was driven by
increased unit sales and higher average selling prices that resulted from
enhanced product offerings highend unixr servers however exhibited some
weakness in 2000 primarily attributable to customer anticipation of our new
superdome server introduced in the fourth quarter of 2000 net revenue growth
for the segment in fiscal 2000 was unfavorably impacted by product transitions
resulting from our switch to a new enterprise storage partner revenue
performance in commercial desktop pcs declined due to lower average selling
prices partially offset by an increase in unit sales

   earnings loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 25 in
fiscal 2001 compared to 49 in fiscal 2000 and 57 in fiscal 1999 an
increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue accounted for 53
of the 74 percentage point decrease in the earnings from operations ratio in
2001 while the remaining 21 percentage points were due to a decline in gross
margin the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was
mainly attributable to lower revenue coupled with a slight increase in
operating expenses the slight increase in operating expenses reflected
significant hiring in the sales organizations over the past year in
anticipation of growth in key areas particularly unixr servers software and
storage which did not materialize due to weakened economic conditions in
addition the segment invested in research and development

activities for server software and storage products half of the gross margin
decline was caused by a decline in pc server gross margin which resulted from
lower average selling prices due to a shift toward lowermargin products and
competitive pricing pressures the remainder of the gross margin decline for
the segment reflected the effect of the overall market slowdown on commercial
desktop pcs and home pcs

   the decrease in the earnings from operations ratio in fiscal 2000 of 08
percentage points was attributable to a 26 percentage point decline in gross
margin partially offset by a 18 percentage point improvement in operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue the decline in gross margin was driven
by a mix shift within the segment toward home pcs and notebook pcs which are
lowermargin products in addition gross margin was unfavorably impacted by
higher memory costs and declining average selling prices across the pc
business these margin declines were partially offset by a shift to
highermargin unixr server and enterprise storage products the improvement
in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to improved
operational efficiencies

consulting drove the increase in revenue in fiscal 2001 with each category
accounting for 3 percentage points of the segments 6 revenue growth on a
weighted basis fiscal 2001 net revenue was also favorably impacted by solid
sales in technology financing and outsourcing which was offset by a revenue
decline in complementary thirdparty products delivered with the sales of hp
solutions overall customer support consulting and technology financing net
revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was moderated by the global economic downturn
while our outsourcing business benefited from the slowdown as companies reduced
costs by outsourcing their it functions the segments overall 13 net revenue
growth for fiscal 2000 was driven by customer support which contributed 4
percentage points on a weighted basis consulting and technology financing each
represented approximately 3 percentage points of the total growth while
strength in our complementary products and outsourcing businesses accounted for
the remainder of the revenue growth for fiscal 2000

   customer support net revenue grew 6 in fiscal 2001 twothirds of which was
attributable to sales of missioncritical and networking services while the
remaining increase was due to strength in various other support services
growth in consulting revenue of 21 was fueled by our ability to pursue an
increased number of as well as larger engagements as a result of the
investment in headcount in fiscal 2000 consulting net revenue reflected strong
demand from the financial services and telecommunications industries each of
which contributed approximately onefourth to the increase in consulting
revenue in 2001 the remaining growth in consulting was attributable to an
increase in engagements for manufacturing businesses as well as growth in
other types of consulting services revenue from our technology financing
business was favorably impacted in fiscal 2001 by a mix shift in the portfolio
toward operating leases net revenue growth in outsourcing was attributable to
larger comprehensive deals and increased business as companies reduced costs by
outsourcing their it functions moderating the segments overall revenue growth
in fiscal 2001 was a decline in the sale of complementary thirdparty products
due to a refocusing of this business and softened demand for networking
products during the fiscal year

   in fiscal 2000 customer support net revenue growth was 8 half of this
growth was attributable to missioncritical and networking services while
another onethird was due to storage services and support growth in consulting
resulted from strong demand from the financial services manufacturing and
telecommunications industries net revenue from the financial services industry
contributed onethird of consulting revenue growth in 2000 while sales to
manufacturing businesses and the telecommunications industry each accounted for
onefifth of the growth technology financing revenue benefited in fiscal 2000
from an increase in customer financing arrangements driven by strong
performance in unixr product sales

   earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 45 in fiscal
2001 compared to 66 in fiscal 2000 and 78 in fiscal 1999 growth in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue and a decline in gross margin
in fiscal 2001 each represented half of the 21 percentage point decrease in
the earnings from operations ratio for the segment the growth in the operating
expense ratio was due substantially to a 172 million increase in bad debt
reserves and writeoffs in our financing portfolio in response to weakened
economic conditions the one percentage point gross margin decline for it
services was driven primarily by a decrease in gross margin related to our
financing and customer support businesses moderated by a gross margin
improvement in outsourcing and consulting the gross margin decline in our
financing business was due to the mix shift toward operating leases which have
lower margins customer support gross margin was negatively impacted by
increased costs for support parts due to unfavorable currency effects and a mix
shift toward lowermargin services the increase in gross margin for
outsourcing reflected increased process standardization and delivery
efficiency while gross margin improvement in consulting resulted from improved
labor utilization and overall engagement cost management

   the 12 percentage point decrease in the earnings from operations ratio in
fiscal 2000 was attributable to a 16 percentage point increase in operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue partially offset by a 04 percentage point
improvement in gross margin the increase in the operating expense ratio was
due primarily to an increase in bad debt writeoffs in our financing portfolio
and higher marketing expense to support hps corporate branding initiative
half of the segments 04 percentage point gross margin improvement was driven
by the optimization of existing data centers in outsourcing in addition
consulting gross margin was positively impacted in 2000 by improved engagement
cost management these margin increases were partially offset by lower margins
in our complementary products business and an increase in hiring in our support
business in anticipation of future growth

liquidity and capital resources

   our financial position remained strong throughout fiscal 2001 despite the
economic downturn with cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of
43 billion at october 31 2001 compared to 40 billion at october 31 2000
during fiscal 2001 cash flows from operating activities and shortterm and
longterm borrowings were used mainly to fund purchases of property plant and
equipment repurchases of our common stock repurchases of our zerocoupon
subordinated convertible notes and payments of dividends

   cash flows from operating activities were 26 billion during fiscal 2001
compared to 37 billion for fiscal 2000 and 31 billion for fiscal 1999 the
decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2001 resulted primarily
from a decline in net earnings and timing of payments on accounts payable
partially offset by a decline in receivables and a decrease in inventory the
increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2000 was due mainly to the
timing of payments on taxes and accounts payable partially offset by increases
in inventory and other assets

   trade and current financing receivables as a percentage of net revenue were
148 down from 175 as of october 31 2000 the yearoveryear improvement
in the ratio is due primarily to a reduction in the number of

effectiveness in collection efforts inventory as a percentage of net revenue
was 115 at october 31 2001 compared to 117 as of october 31 2000 the
slight decrease in the ratio year over year is mainly attributable to active

factors that could affect future results

the competitive pressures we face could harm our revenues gross margins and
prospects

   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in
all areas of our business and compete primarily on the basis of technology
performance price quality reliability brand distribution customer service
and support if we fail to develop new products services and support
periodically enhance our existing products services and support or otherwise
compete successfully it could harm our operations and prospects further we
may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products services and
support to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or
improve gross margins if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure
in response to competitive price pressures our gross margins and therefore our
profitability could be adversely affected

if we cannot continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products
and services rapidly that meet customer requirements for performance and
reliability we may lose market share and our revenues may suffer

   the process of developing new high technology products and services is
complex and uncertain and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and
emerging technological trends accurately and to develop or obtain appropriate
intellectual property could significantly harm our results of operations we
must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing
whether our predictions will eventually result in products that the market will
accept after a product is developed we must be able to manufacture sufficient
volumes quickly and at low costs to accomplish this we must accurately
forecast volumes mix of products and configurations that meet customer
requirements and we may not succeed

if we do not effectively manage the transition from existing products to new
products our revenues may suffer

   if we do not make an effective transition from existing products to new
products our revenues may be seriously harmed among the factors that make a
smooth transition from current products to new products difficult are delays in
product development or manufacturing variations in product costs delays in
customer

purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions and
customer demand for the new product our revenues and gross margins also may
suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers
and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life
cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product
introduction furthermore sales of our new products may replace sales of some
of our current products offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
introduction there may also be overlaps in the current products of hp and
product portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that must be
managed given the competitive nature of our industry if we incur delays in
new product introductions or do not accurately estimate the market effects of
new product introductions future demand for our products and our revenues may
be seriously harmed

our revenues and selling general and administrative expenses will suffer if we
cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which
our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their
intellectual property rights

   we generally rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in
the united states and similar laws in other countries and agreements with our
employees customers partners and other parties to establish and maintain our
intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations
however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged
invalidated or circumvented or our intellectual property rights may not
provide competitive advantages which could significantly harm our business
also because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information
technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key
technologies developed by third parties and we may not be able to obtain or to
continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or
on reasonable terms third parties also may claim that we are infringing upon
their intellectual property rights even if we do not believe that our products
or business are infringing upon third parties intellectual property rights
the claims can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert managements
attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property
infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license
agreements if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or
on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source our
operations could suffer in addition it is possible that as a consequence of
mergers and acquisitions some of our intellectual property rights may be
licensed to a third party that had not been licensed prior to the transaction
or that certain restrictions could be imposed on our business that had not been
imposed prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive
advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be
required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these
agreements

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if
our distributors financial condition or operations weaken our revenues and
gross margins could be adversely affected

   we use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and
services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both retail and
direct sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers since each distribution
method has distinct risks and gross margins the failure to implement the most
advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could
adversely affect our gross margins and therefore profitability for example

    as we continue to increase our commitment to direct sales we could risk
     alienating channel partners and adversely affecting our distribution
     model

     since direct sales may compete with the sales made by thirdparty
     resellers and distributors these thirdparty resellers and distributors
     may elect to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own
     products

                    managements discussion and analysis of
           financial condition and results of operations continued

     because not all of our customers will prefer to or seek to purchase
     directly any increase in our commitment to direct sales in order to
     increase our gross margins could alienate some of our channel partners as
     a result we may lose some of our customers who purchase from thirdparty
     resellers or distributors

    some of our wholesale and retail distributors may be unable to withstand
     changes in business conditions

     some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient
     financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business
     conditions including the recent economic downturn revenues from indirect
     sales could suffer if our distributors financial condition or operations
     weaken

    our inventory management will be complex as we will continue to sell a
     significant mix of products through distributors

     we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales
     to distributors distributors may increase orders during periods of
     product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay
     orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their
     orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our
     competitors that are available to the distributor and seasonal
     fluctuations in enduser demand if we have excess inventory we may have
     to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result
     in lower gross margins

we depend on third party suppliers and our revenues and gross margins could be
adversely affected if we fail to receive timely delivery of quality components
or if we fail to manage inventory levels properly

   our manufacturing operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs
for components and products and our suppliers ability to deliver quality
components and products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution
schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we
offer and the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are
dispersed across the globe problems could arise in planning production and
managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us among the problems that
could arise are component shortages excess supply and risks related to
fixedprice contracts that would require us to pay more than the open market
price

    supply shortages  we occasionally may experience a short supply of
     certain component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for
     those parts or problems experienced by suppliers if shortages or delays
     persist the price of these components may increase or the components may
     not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at
     reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a
     timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our
     revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be
     developed

    oversupply  in order to secure components for the production of new
     products at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or we may
     enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors if we fail to
     anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply of parts could
     result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our
     gross margins

    longterm pricing commitments  as a result of binding price or purchase
     commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components at
     prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the
     event that we become committed to purchase components for prices in excess
     of the current market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors
     who have access to components at lower prices and our gross margins could
     suffer

in order to be successful we must retain and motivate key employees and
failure to do so could seriously harm us

   in order to be successful we must retain and motivate executives and other
key employees including those in managerial technical marketing and
information technology support positions in particular our product generation
efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers attracting and
retaining skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified
sales representatives is also critical to our future experienced management
and technical marketing and support personnel in the information technology
industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense this
is particularly the case in silicon valley where hps headquarters and certain
key research and development facilities are located the loss of key employees
could have a significant impact on our operations we also must continue to
motivate employees and keep them focused on hps strategies and goals which
may be particularly difficult due to morale challenges posed by workforce
reductions and general uncertainty

the economic downturn could adversely affect our revenues gross margins and
expenses

   our revenues and gross margins depend significantly on the overall demand
for computing and imaging products and services particularly in the product
and service segments in which we compete softening demand for our products and
services caused by the ongoing economic downturn may result in decreased
revenues earnings levels or growth rates and problems with the saleability of
inventory and realizability of customer receivables the global economy has
weakened and market conditions continue to be challenging as a result
individuals and companies are delaying or reducing expenditures including
those for information technology we have observed effects of the global
economic downturn in many areas of our business the downturn has contributed
to reported net revenue declines during fiscal 2001 we have also experienced
gross margin declines reflecting the effect of competitive pressures as well
as inventory writedowns and charges associated with the cancellation of planned
production line expansion our selling general and administrative expense also
was impacted due in part to an increase in bad debt writeoffs and additions to
reserves in our receivables portfolio the economic downturn also has led to
restructuring actions and contributed to writedowns to reflect the impairment
of certain investments in our investment portfolio further delays or
reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse
effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results
of operations prospects and stock price

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes
could harm our future revenues costs and expenses and financial condition

   sales outside the united states make up more than half of our revenues our
future revenues costs and expenses and financial condition could be adversely
affected by a variety of international factors including

    changes in a countrys or regions political or economical conditions

    longer accounts receivable cycles

    trade protection measures

    import or export licensing requirements

    overlap or different corporate structures

    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

    differing technology standards andor customer requirements

    import or export licensing requirements which could affect our ability to
     obtain favorable terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions

    problems caused by the conversion of various european currencies to the
     euro and macroeconomic dislocations that may result and

    natural disasters

   a portion of our product and component manufacturing along with key
suppliers also is located outside of the united states and also could be
disrupted by some of the international factors described above in particular
along with most other pc vendors we have engaged manufacturers in taiwan for
the production of notebook computers in 1999 taiwan suffered a major
earthquake and in 2000 it suffered a typhoon both of which resulted in
temporary communications and supply disruptions in addition we procure
components from japan which also suffers from earthquakes periodically
moreover we are in the process of acquiring indigo nv which has research
and development and manufacturing operations located in israel which may be
more subject to disruptions in light of recent world events

impairment of investment and financing portfolios could harm our net earnings

   we have an investment portfolio that includes minority equity and debt
investments and financing for the purchase of our products and services in
most cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on
these investments and may incur losses related to the impairment of these
investments and therefore charges to net earnings some of our investments are
in public and privately held companies that are still in the startup or
development stage which have inherent risks because the markets for the
technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early
stages and may never develop furthermore the values of our investments in
publiclytraded companies are subject to significant market price volatility
our investments in technology companies often are coupled with a strategic
commercial relationship our commercial agreements with these companies may not
be sufficient to allow us to obtain and integrate such products our technology
into our technology or product lines or otherwise benefit from the
relationship and these companies may be subsequently acquired by third
parties including competitors moreover due to the economic downturn and
difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies to which we have
supplied financing our investment portfolio could be further impaired

in order to manage our portfolio of products and technology and further our
competitive objectives we must successfully complete acquisitions and
alliances that enhance our strategic businesses and product lines and divest
nonstrategic businesses and product lines

   as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with
third parties regarding and enter into agreements relating to possible
acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures in order to
manage our product and technology portfolios and further strategic objectives
in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable
acquisition alliance or divestiture candidates complete these transactions
some of which may be large and complex and integrate acquired companies
integration and other risks of acquisitions and strategic alliances can be more
pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple
acquisitions are pursued simultaneously however if we fail to identify and
complete these transactions we may be required to expend resources to
internally develop products and technology may be at a competitive
disadvantage or may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions which
may have a material effect on our revenues and selling general and
administrative expenses

   integration issues are complex timeconsuming and expensive and without
proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business
the challenges involved in integration include

    demonstrating to customers that the transaction will not result in adverse
     changes in client service standards or business focus and helping
     customers conduct business easily

     local laws and regulations and

    managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of
     other independent reorganizations

   we may not successfully address these integration challenges in a timely
manner or at all and we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies
of the transaction to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated currently
we have several acquisitions that are pending completion including the
proposed merger with compaq or that recently have been completed and are still
being integrated in addition to the pending compaq transaction we have
pending a proposed acquisition of indigo nv a leading commercial and
industrial printing systems company in 2001 we completed acquisitions of
storageapps inc a provider of storage virtualization solutions and
bluestone software inc which became part of our middleware division the
number of pending transactions and the size and scope of the proposed merger
with compaq increase both the scope and consequences of ongoing integration
risks

   even if an acquisition or alliance is successfully integrated we may not
receive the expected benefits of the transaction managing acquisitions
alliances joint ventures and divestitures requires varying levels of
management resources which may divert our attention from other business
operations these transactions also may result in significant costs and
expenses and charges to earnings as a result any completed pending or future
transactions may contribute to financial results of the combined company that
differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter

terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenues
costs and expenses and financial condition

   terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause
damage or disruption to hp our employees facilities partners suppliers
distributors resellers or customers which could significantly impact our
revenues costs and expenses and financial condition the terrorist attacks
that took place in the united states on september 11 2001 were unprecedented
events that have created many economic and political uncertainties some of
which may materially harm our business and results of operations the longterm
effects on our business of the september 11 2001 attacks are unknown the
potential for future terrorist attacks the national and international
responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created

presently be predicted in addition as a major multinational company with
headquarters and significant operations located in the united states we may be
impacted by actions against the united states we are predominantly uninsured
for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial
condition and increase our costs and expenses

   our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other
business disruptions which could seriously harm our revenues and financial
condition and increase our costs and expenses our corporate headquarters a
portion of our research and development activities other critical business
operations and some of our suppliers are located in california near major
earthquake faults the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our
general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults is
unknown but our revenues and financial condition and our costs and expenses
could be significantly impacted in the event of a major earthquake in
addition some areas including california have experienced and may continue
to experience ongoing power shortages which have resulted in rolling
blackouts these blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations or the
operations of our suppliers distributors and resellers or customers we are
predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes
power outages and other natural disasters

the revenues and profitability of our operations have historically varied

   our revenues and profit margins vary among our products customer groups and
geographic markets our revenue mix in future periods will be different than
our current revenue mix overall profitability in any given period is dependent
partially on the product customer and geographic mix reflected in that
periods net revenue and therefore revenue and gross margin trends cannot be
reliably predicted actual trends may cause us to adjust our operations which
could cause periodtoperiod fluctuations in our results of operations

failure to execute planned cost reductions successfully could result in total
costs and expenses that are greater than expected

   historically we have undertaken restructuring plans to bring operational
expenses to appropriate levels for each of our businesses while simultaneously
implementing extensive new companywide expensecontrol programs in addition
to previously announced workforce reductions we may have additional workforce
reductions in the future the proposed merger with compaq contemplates
workforce reductions that are expected to involve approximately 15000
employees of the combined company worldwide and workforce reductions would
also be expected if the proposed merger is not completed significant risks
associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve
anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include
delays in implementation of anticipated reductions in force in highly regulated
locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia
redundancies among restructuring programs and the failure to meet operational
targets due to the loss of employees or decreases in employee morale

hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate

   hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile
some of the factors that can affect our stock price are

    the announcement of new products services or technological innovations by
     hp or our competitors

    quarterly increases or decreases in hps revenue or earnings

    changes in quarterly revenue or earnings estimates by the investment
     community and

    speculation in the press or investment community about hps strategic
     position financial condition results of operations business or
     significant transactions

   general market conditions or domestic or international macroeconomic and
geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect hps stock
price for these reasons investors should not rely on recent trends to predict
future stock prices or financial results in addition following periods of
volatility in a companys securities securities class action litigation
against a company is sometimes instituted this type of litigation could result
in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources

unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings

   some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state
and international laws governing the environment we could be subject to
liability for remediation if we do not handle these substances in compliance
with applicable laws it is our policy to apply strict standards for
environmental protection to sites inside and outside the united states even
when not subject to local government regulations we record a liability for
environmental remediation and related costs when we consider the costs to be
probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated we have not
incurred environmental costs that are presently material and we are not
presently subject to known environmental liabilities that we expect to be
material

some antitakeover provisions contained in hps certificate of incorporation
bylaws and shareowner rights plan as well as provisions of delaware law could
impair a takeover attempt

   hp has provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of
which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an
acquisition deemed undesirable by the hp board of directors these include
provisions

    authorizing blank check preferred stock which could be issued with
     voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to its common
     stock

    limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to directors and
     officers

    limiting the ability of hp shareowners to call special meetings

    requiring advance notice of shareowner proposals for business to be
     conducted at meetings of hp shareowners and for nominations of candidates
     for election to the hp board of directors

    controlling the procedures for conduct of board and shareowner meetings
     and election and removal of directors and

    specifying that shareholders may take action only at a duly called annual
     or special meeting of shareowners

   these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers
proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp

   in addition hp has adopted a shareowner rights plan the rights are not
intended to prevent a takeover of hp however the rights may have the effect
of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed
undesirable by the hp board of directors the rights will cause substantial
dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire hp on terms or in a
manner not approved by the hp board of directors except pursuant to an offer
conditioned upon redemption of the rights

   as a delaware corporation hp also is subject to provisions of delaware law
including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents
some shareowner from engaging in certain business combinations without approval
of the holders of substantially all of hps outstanding common stock

   any provision of hps certificate of incorporation or bylaws hps
shareowner rights plan or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or
deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for hp shareowner to
receive a premium for their shares of hp common stock and could also affect
the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp common stock

hp faces numerous additional risks in connection with the proposed transaction
with compaq which may adversely affect our results of operations whether or
not the merger is completed and the merger may not be completed on a timely
basis or at all

   in response to the pending merger transaction involving compaq customers
and distributors of hp may defer purchasing decisions or elect to switch to
other suppliers due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings
following the merger and our willingness to support and service existing
products in order to address customer uncertainty we may incur additional
obligations uncertainty surrounding the proposed transaction also may have an
adverse effect on employee morale and retention and result in the diversion of
management attention and resources in addition the market values of hp common
stock and compaq common stock will continue to vary prior to completion of the
merger transaction due to changes in the business operations or prospects of
hp or compaq market assessments of the merger regulatory considerations
market and economic considerations or other factors however there will be no
adjustment to the exchange ratio between hp and compaq shares in connection
with the merger and the parties do not have a right to terminate the merger
agreement based upon changes in the market price of either hp common stock or
compaq common stock

   completion of the merger also is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties hp and compaq may be unable to obtain regulatory or shareowner
approvals required to complete the merger in a timely manner or at all in
order to obtain regulatory approval we may be required to comply with material
restrictions or conditions which could include a complete or partial license
divestiture spinoff or the holding separate of assets or businesses hp and
compaq also are required to obtain separate shareowner approvals in connection
with the merger walter b hewlett eleanor hewlett limon mary hewlett gaffe
and the william r hewlett revocable trust have announced that they intend to
vote against the proposal to approve the issuance of hp common stock in
connection with the compaq merger in addition each of the william and flora
hewlett foundation and the david and lucite packard foundation has announced
its intention to vote against the proposal to approve the issuance of hp common
stock in connection with the compaq merger mr hewlett cotrustee of the
william r hewlett revocable trust and chairman of the hewlett foundation
edwin van pronghorns cotrustee of the william r hewlett revocable trust and
trustee of certain hewlett family trusts and the william r hewlett revocable
trust have filed a preliminary proxy statement with the securities and exchange
commission stating that they intend to solicit proxies from hp shareowner
against the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of hp common stock in
connection with the compaq merger and have disseminated to hp shareowner
soliciting materials encouraging hp shareowner to vote against the compaq
merger if the merger is not completed the price of hp common stock may
decline to the extent that the current market price of hp common stock reflects
a market assumption that the merger will be completed moreover hp would not
derive the strategic benefits expected to result from the merger such as
creating a more complete and balanced product and services portfolio and
providing economies of scale in businesses such as pcs in addition our
business may be harmed to the extent that customers suppliers or others
believe that we cannot effectively compete in the marketplace without the
merger or there is customer and employee uncertainty surrounding the future
direction of the product and service offerings and strategy of hp on a
standalone basis we also will be required to pay significant costs incurred

in connection with the merger including legal accounting and a portion of the
financial advisory fees whether or not the merger is completed moreover
under specified circumstances hp may be required to pay compaq a termination
fee of 675 million in connection with the termination of the merger agreement

   if the merger is completed we will continue to face risks associated with
integration of the businesses and operations of hp and compaq and we may not
realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger primarily
associated with anticipated restructurings and other operational efficiencies
to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated in addition to the integration
risks previously discussed our ability to realize these benefits and synergies
could be impacted adversely by practical or legal constraints on combining
operations or implementing workforce reductions in addition to the costs and
expenses previously discussed we will be required to make payments to
executive officers and key employees under a retention plan adopted in
connection with the merger also any downgrade in our credit ratings
associated with the merger could adversely affect our ability to borrow and
result in more restrictive borrowing terms including increased borrowing
costs more restrictive covenants and the extension of less open credit this
in turn could affect our internal cost of capital estimates and therefore
operational decisions in addition the effective tax rate of hp following the
merger is uncertain and could exceed hps currently reported tax rate and the
weighted average of the premerger tax rates of hp and compaq moreover
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of
accounting may affect the market value of hps common stock adversely following
the merger as hp will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense
over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets
acquired in connection with the merger and to the extent the value of
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with
the merger becomes impaired hp may be required to incur material charges
relating to the impairment of those assets the foregoing risks are described
in more detail in hps current report on form 8k dated november 15 2001 and
incorporated by reference herein

adoption of the euro

   in 1997 we established a dedicated task force to address the issues raised
by the introduction of a european single currency the euro the euros initial
implementation was effective as of january 1 1999 and the transition period
continued through january 1 2002 when the euro was adopted as the physical
currency and legal tender in twelve european countries the final step of the
transition on january 1 1999 we began converting our product prices from
local currencies to the euro as required we implemented system changes to give
multicurrency capability to internal applications and to ensure that external
partners systems processing euro conversions were compliant with the european
council regulations in addition we implemented design changes to support
display and printing of the euro character by impacted hp products in 2000
our task force implemented a comprehensive euro program to manage the
changeover of all operational aspects of our business in preparation for the
final transition in january 2002 we experienced no significant operational
issues upon the final implementation date

   the introduction and use of the euro has not had a material effect on our
foreign exchange and hedging activities use of derivative instruments or
overall foreign currency risk and we do not presently expect that it will we
do not expect a material impact on product pricing but we will continue to
monitor this aspect of the change going forward all costs associated with the
conversion to the euro are expensed to operations as incurred while we will
continue to evaluate the impact of the euro over time based on currently
available information we do not believe that the use of the euro currency will
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition cash
flows or results of operations

recent accounting pronouncements

   in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 business
combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas
141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase
method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible
assets acquired in a business combination the provisions of sfas 141 apply to
all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 we do not expect that
the adoption of sfas 141 will have a material effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations sfas 142 requires that goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized
however these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over
their respective useful lives the standard also establishes specific guidance
for testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives the provisions of sfas 142 will be effective for our fiscal year
2003 with early adoption permitted at the beginning of our fiscal year 2002
however goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june 30 2001 are
subject immediately to the nonamortization provisions of sfas 142 we are
currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption
of sfas 142 will have on our consolidated financial position and results of
operations

   in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 amends existing
accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model
for longlived assets to be disposed of among other provisions the new rules
change the criteria for classifying an asset as heldforsale the standard
also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for
reporting as discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing
losses on such operations the provisions of sfas 144 will be effective for our
fiscal year 2003 and will be applied prospectively we are currently in the
process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas 144 will
have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

   in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency
exchange rate interest rate and equity market price risks that could impact
our results of operations our risk management strategy includes the use of
derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased
options to hedge certain of these exposures our objective is to offset gains
and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the
derivative contracts used to hedge them thereby reducing volatility of
earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities we do not enter
into any trading or speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments

foreign currency exchange rate risk

   we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales
commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact
business in approximately 30 currencies worldwide of which the most
significant to our operations are the euro the japanese yen and the british
pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and
therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a
stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact
significant amounts of business for the japanese yen however we are a net
payer and therefore tend to benefit from a stronger us dollar against the
yen we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of october 31 2001 and 2000
using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising
from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency
exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held
constant the analysis covers all of our foreign exchange forward contracts
offset by the underlying exposures options are excluded from the analysis the

currency exchange rates used were based on the spot rates in effect at october
31 2001 and 2000 the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10
adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in
the fair values of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments net
of exposures of 52 million at october 31 2001 and 45 million at october 31
2000

interest rate risk

   we are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed rate debt and
investment portfolios and financing receivables we have performed a
sensitivity analysis as of october 31 2001 and 2000 using a modeling
technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a
hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates with all
other variables held constant the analysis covers our fixed rate unhedged
debt unhedged investment instruments and financing receivables and is based on
our assumed overall maturities of three months for shortterm debt and
investments three years for longterm debt and investments and the actual
maturities for financing receivables the discount rates used were based on the
market interest rates in effect at october 31 2001 and 2000 the sensitivity
analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates
would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investment
instruments and financing receivables of 14 million at october 31 2001 and
36 million at october 31 2000

equity price risk

   we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of
publiclytraded equity securities which had an estimated fair value of 148
million at october 31 2001 and 328 million at october 31 2000 we monitor
our equity investments on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying
value of the equity investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value
is determined to be otherthan temporary the carrying value is reduced to its
current fair value generally we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our
market exposure on these equity securities we do not hold our equity
securities for trading or speculative purposes a hypothetical 30 adverse
change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would
result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of 44
million at october 31 2001 and 98 million at october 31 2000

   actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the
sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest
rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual
exposures and hedges

   on september 21 2000 the audit committee of hps board of directors
terminated pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc as hps independent public
accountants with respect to the audit of hps consolidated financial statements
for the fiscal year ended october 31 2000 the 2000 audit the decision was
made because of concerns by both hp and pwc regarding the timing of the
completion of the 2000 audit in light of the potential loss of pwcs
independence since hp was in discussion with pwc over a possible acquisition of
its global management and information consulting practice the potential
acquisition pwc had already ceased all audit work for hp on september 12
2000 hp subsequently terminated discussions with pwc with respect to the
potential acquisition because hp and pwc could not reach a mutually acceptable
agreement

   on september 21 2000 the audit committee also selected and appointed ernst
 young llp ey to serve as hps independent auditor with respect to the
2000 audit at that time hp committed to undertake a more formal evaluation
process in selecting independent public auditors with respect to the audit of
hps consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending october 31
2001 the 2001 audit on february 5 2001 the audit committee unanimously
approved the appointment of ey as the companys independent auditors to
complete the 2001 audit on november 16 2001 the audit committee unanimously
approved the appointment of ey as the companys independent auditors to
complete the audit of hps consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ending october 31 2002

   neither the reports of ey with respect to the 2001 audit or 2000 audit nor
the report of pwc with respect to the audits of hps consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal years ended october 31 1999 or october 31 1998
contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or were qualified or
modified as to uncertainty audit scope or accounting principles in addition
during hps fiscal years ended october 31 1999 and october 31 1998 and
through september 21 2000 there were no disagreements with pwc on any matter
of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure with respect to hps consolidated financial
statements which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of pwc
would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreements in connection with its reports

   prior to retaining ey with respect to the 2000 audit hp consulted with ey
on various aspects of the potential acquisition including tax and accounting
matters related to a variety of preliminary structures for the potential
acquisition hp did not consult with pwc on such issues

    executive officers as variable pay under the executive payforresults

    dependent upon the degree to which performance metrics defined on a
    semiannual basis were met in november 2000 and may 2001 the

   compensation committee established the performance metrics for the first and
   second halves of fiscal 2001 respectively these metrics varied for each
   participant but at least a portion of each persons pay was dependent on
   companywide revenue and net profit metrics for fiscal 2001 the
   compensation committee determined that the variable compensation for the
   named executive officers would be zero for both periods

    for fiscal 2000 pursuant to the terms of her employment contract ms
    fiorina was entitled to receive a minimum guaranteed bonus of 1250000
    during the second half of fiscal 2000 ms fiorina received a prorated
    portion of the minimum annual guaranteed bonus or 625000 in accordance
    with normal payroll practices in light of the company falling short of
    meeting its net profit objectives for the second half of fiscal 2000
    resulting in no payout to the other named executive officers and executive
    council members ms fiorina initiated a dialogue with the compensation
    committee and recommended that her guaranteed bonus for the second half of
    fiscal 2000 be zero the compensation committee agreed with ms fiorinas
    recommendation and modified ms fiorinas fiscal 2001 bonus opportunity by
    reducing it by 625000 after it was determined there would be no bonus
    payout to ms fiorina for fiscal 2001 ms fiorina paid the company an
    amount equal to the aftertax amount of her second half fiscal 2000
    guaranteed bonus of 625000 in the first half of fiscal 2000 ms fiorina
    received a shortterm bonus of 1141250 as determined by the
    compensation committee

page

   performancebased restricted stock granted in fiscal 1999 had not been met
   therefore mr wayman mr zitzner and ms livermore forfeited 100 of the
   performancebased restricted stock granted to them in fiscal 1999 the value
   of the forfeiture is reflected in the summary compensation table as a
   negative ltip payout in fiscal year 2001 based upon the value of hp stock as
   of the date of the grant in fiscal 1999 adjusted for the agilent
   technologies spinoff

    in november 2000 the compensation committee reviewed the results for the
    threeyear performance period ended october 31 2000 and determined that
    the performance objectives associated with performancebased restricted
    stock granted in fiscal 1998 had been exceeded therefore a 25 bonus to
    the restricted stock granted to mr wayman in 1998 was made and the value
    of this bonus is reflected in the ltip payouts column in fiscal 2000 based
    upon the value of hp stock as of the date of the grant in fiscal year 1998

    in november 1999 the compensation committee reviewed the results for the
    threeyear performance period ended october 31 1999 and determined that
    the performance objectives associated with performancebased restricted
    stock granted in fiscal 1997 had been met at target therefore no
    adjustments to the stock grants were made and the amount in the ltip

print technology by achieving digital output quality and endurance standards
that match and in some cases exceed traditional optical and silver hallide
technology we expect these products to stimulate hps imaging and printing
supplies business

    as a component of our overall strategy we launched our printing eservices
initiative in april 2000 together with a set of printing eservice providers hp
and our partners are developing strategies printing appliances and
technologies designed to drive printing to the center of the internet by
transforming the role of printers into smart internet appliances with these
internetbased services printers are becoming local post offices ticket
offices shipping stations and print shops

marketing

    customers and sales organization

    hp has approximately 540 sales and support offices and distributorships in
more than 120 countries sales are made to business and consumer customers
worldwide

    we continue to manage our business and report our financial results based on
our three business segments cs ips its in addition during fiscal 2000 hp
began to supplement this product generation structure with a customerfacing
view the marketing and selling of our products and services have been
reorganized into two main customerfacing organizations a consumer business
organization cbo and a business customer organization bco

    cbo comprises all of hps consumerrelated marketing and selling activities
consolidated into a single functional unit and bco represents the consolidation
of all of hps business and enterpriserelated marketing and selling activities
into a single functional unit

    these two customerfacing organizations are charged with building an
intimate and comprehensive understanding of their respective customers needs
this feedback and knowledge is then incorporated into planning decisions
supported by our productgeneration organizations such as computing systems and
imaging and printing systems the overall purpose of this new marketing
structure is to enable us to better leverage our core assets to deliver
worldclass technology services and solutions and a worldclass customer
experience

    consumer business organization  cbo is responsible for marketing and
supplying hps consumer products around the world cbo is organized by product
offerings including home pcs pavilion desktop and notebook products printing
and supplies deskjet and allinone inkjet printers ink cartridges and media
digital imaging scanjet scanners digital cameras digital convergence cdrw
drives dvdrw standards work and information appliances jornada pdas
embedded software by integrating the marketing for all consumer products into
a single organization hp hopes to reduce redundancies and better leverage
opportunities for crosscategory consumer product marketing

    we are currently the marketshare leader for consumer inkjet printers and
the secondlargest supplier of branded consumer desktop pcs worldwide in the
us hp is the marketshare leader in scanners and cdrw drives we have
adopted a blended channel strategy for consumer product distribution in the us
that includes sales through approximately 20000 thirdparty retail locations
and direct sales through hpshoppingcom a whollyowned subsidiary formed in
may 1999 to support online sales

    key product development initiatives include an increased focus on
consumeroriented industrial design providing additional beyondthebox
consumer eserviceseither independently or in conjunction with thirdparty
partners and a strong cross product category marketing focus on digital
imaging

    revenues in cbo are derived through reseller channels including retailers
dealers and original equipment manufacturers as well as through direct sales and
distribution to customers over the web

    business customer organization  bco is responsible for marketing and
delivering products services and solutions to all of hps business and
enterprise customers bcos customers include small and medium businesses as
well as global enterprises particularly telecommunications service providers
internet service providers and academic scientific and government institutions

                                       7
page
    bco is charged with developing a comprehensive understanding of hps
business customers needs and translating this understanding into delivering
worldclass services solutions and customer experience throughout the customer
lifecycle

    to do so bco markets products services and solutions that can be either
individual products and services or unique combinations of offerings from
imaging and printing systems computer systems and it services

    revenues in bco result from the efforts of hps business customer sales
force which includes direct field sales representatives indirect sales ie
commercial channels hp consultants presales technical personnel and
administrative support staff bcos direct sales force is divided into specialty
product and service representatives such as for servers storage software and
services and teams assigned directly to corporate accounts which represent all
of hps product and service categories

    international

    a summary of hps net revenue and net property plant and equipment by
geographic area is set forth in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements
in item 8 below which information is incorporated herein by reference more
than half of our overall revenue comes from outside of the us in the last
three fiscal years more than threefourths of this international revenue was
derived from europe and the asia pacific region a majority of our net revenue
originating outside the us was from customers other than foreign governments

    most of hps sales in international markets are made by foreign sales
subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through
various representatives and distributors

    for a discussion of risks attendant to hps foreign operations see
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationsfactors that could affect future resultsinternational and
market risk and managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operationsadoption of the euro in item 7 below and
note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 below which are
incorporated herein by reference

    we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our
worldwide operations and revenue streams thereby reducing the impact of adverse
economic changes in any single country

materials

    our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors
electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic
resins and sheet metal although we believe that the materials and supplies
necessary for our manufacturing operations are presently available in the
quantities required we sometimes experience a short supply of certain component
parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts

    we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial
number of vendors for many of our products we have existing alternate sources
of supply or such sources are readily available

patents

    hps general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions
and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or to
give us a competitive advantage while we believe that our patents and
applications have value in general no single patent is in itself essential to
us as a whole or any of our principal business segments in addition any of our
proprietary rights could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may not
provide significant competitive advantages

                                       8
page
backlog

    hp believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business
prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from shelf inventories
the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of net revenue
related to our service and support business therefore we believe that backlog
information is not material to an understanding of our business

competition

    we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity
our competitors are numerous ranging from some of the worlds largest
corporations to many relatively small and highly specialized firms hp competes
primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability
brand distribution and customer service and support our reputation the ease
of use of our products the ready availability of multiple software
applications our alwayson internet infrastructure offering and our customer
training services and support are also important competitive factors

    the markets for each of our three principal segments are characterized by
vigorous competition among major corporations with longestablished positions
and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms product life cycles are
short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services
periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively
on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of
our current and potential partners the successful management of these
competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success
moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many
of our products and services to stay competitive and thus effectively manage
financial returns with correspondingly reduced gross margins

    while the absence of reliable statistics and companies with comparable
product mixes makes it difficult to state hps relative market position with
certainty on an overall basis we are among the largest usbased companies
offering our range of generalpurpose computers and personalinformation
imaging and printing products for industrial scientific and business
applications and information technology services hp is the leader or among the
leaders in each of our principal business segments

research and development

    the process of developing new hightechnology products and solutions is
inherently complex and uncertain it requires among other things innovation
and accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging
technological trends without the introduction of new products services and
enhancements hps products and services are likely to become technologically
obsolete over time in which case revenues would be materially and adversely
affected new products and services if and when introduced may not achieve
market acceptance after the products and services are developed hp must
quickly manufacture and deliver such products and services in sufficient volumes
at acceptable costs to meet demand

    hewlettpackard laboratories together with the various research and
development groups within the three principal business segments are responsible
for hps total research and development efforts

    expenditures for research and development in fiscal 2000 including
hewlettpackard laboratories and the three principal business segments were
26 billion these expenditures were 24 billion in fiscal 1999 and
24 billion in fiscal 1998 in fiscal 2000 total research and development
expenditures were 54 of net revenue compared to 58 in fiscal 1999 and 60
in fiscal 1998

    we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and
development expenditures in the future to maintain our competitive position with
a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services

                                       9

environment

    certain of hps operations involve the use of substances regulated under
various federal state and international laws governing the environment it is
our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites
inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulations imposed by local
governments the liability for environmental remediation and related costs is
accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated environmental costs are presently not material to our operations or
financial position

employees

    hp had approximately 88500 employees worldwide as of october 31 2000

    information regarding the executive officers of hp is set forth in part iii
below









item 2  properties

    the principal executive offices of hp are located at 3000 hanover street
palo alto california 94304 as of october 31 2000 we owned or leased a total
of approximately 435 million square feet of space worldwide including
11 million square feet currently occupied by agilent technologies inc we
believe that our existing properties are in good condition and suitable for the
conduct of our business

    our plants are equipped with machinery most of which is owned and is in
part developed by us to meet the special requirements for manufacturing
computers peripherals and systems at the end of fiscal 2000 we were
productively utilizing the vast majority of the space in our facilities while
actively disposing of space determined to be excess

    we anticipate that most of the capital necessary for expansion will continue
to be obtained from internally generated funds investment in new property
plant and equipment from continuing operations amounted to 17 billion in
fiscal 2000 11 billion in fiscal 1999 and 16 billion in fiscal 1998

    as of october 31 2000 our sales and support operations occupied
approximately 126 million square feet of which approximately 34 million
square feet were located within the us we own 44 of the space used for
marketing activities and lease the remaining 56

    hps manufacturing plants research and development facilities and warehouse
and administrative facilities occupied approximately 309 million square feet
of which approximately 215 million square feet were located within the us we
own 61 of our manufacturing research and development warehouse and
administrative space and lease the remaining 39 none of the property owned by
us is held subject to any major encumbrances

    as indicated above hp has three principal business segments imaging and
printing systems computing systems and it services because of the
interrelation of these three segments substantially all of the properties are
used at least in part by each of these segments and we retain the flexibility
to use each of the properties in whole or in part for each of the segments

    the following is a summary of operating results at the hp consolidated
level this discussion is followed by a more detailed discussion of operating
results by segment

    hp reported net revenue growth of 15 in 2000 following growth of 7 in
1999 in 2000 we experienced strong market acceptance of our home and notebook
pcs printing supplies unixregistered trademark servers and imaging devices
this growth was partially offset by the continued transition to a new enterprise
storage strategy softening demand in the business desktop pc and business
printer markets and unfavorable foreign currency effects dollar revenue and
gross margin growth were also constrained by lower average selling prices and a
shift to the lowend in many product categories however operating expenses as
a percentage of net revenue decreased by 06 percentage points in 2000 compared
to 1999 due to improved operational efficiencies interest income and other
net increased by 40 primarily as a result of nonoperational gains including
gains from divestitures of nonstrategic portions of our business as a result
net earnings from continuing operations as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal
2000 was comparable to fiscal 1999 net earnings from continuing operations
increased 15 in 2000 compared to a 16 increase in 1999

    costs expenses and earnings as a percentage of net revenue were as follows

                    managements discussion and analysis of

           financial condition and results of operations continued

net revenue

    net revenue growth of 15 in fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from strong
performance in the computing systems and imaging and printing systems segments
while the 7 revenue growth in 1999 was driven by growth in imaging and printing
systems overall both product sales and service revenue for the fiscal year
increased 15 over 1999 product sales for fiscal 1999 increased 7 over 1998
while service revenue grew 9 over the same period us revenue in 2000
increased 14 over 1999 to 216 billion international revenue in 2000 grew 16
overall to 272 billion largely driven by economic improvement in asia in
1999 us revenue increased 6 and international revenue increased 9 compared
to 1998 fluctuations in currency rates adversely impacted revenue growth for
the company as a whole by approximately 20 percentage points in fiscal 2000 due
mainly to the weakening of the euro while currency fluctuations had a minimal
impact on revenue growth in 1999

cost of products sold and cost of services

    cost of products sold and services as a percentage of net revenue was 715
in fiscal 2000 compared with 701 in 1999 and 705 in 1998 the
14 percentage point increase in the cost of sales percentage in fiscal 2000
versus 1999 resulted primarily from increases in cost of sales for the computing
systems segment the decline in the 1999 cost of sales percentage versus 1998
was attributable to gross margin improvements in computing systems partially
offset by an increase in cost of sales in the it services segment we expect
cost of products sold and services as a percentage of net revenue to increase in
the future due to continued competitive pricing pressures and changes in product
mix

operating expenses

    total operating expenses composed of research and development and selling
general and administrative expenses increased 12 and 9 in 2000 and 1999 when
compared to 1999 and 1998 respectively in fiscal 1999 hiring controls
implemented in 1998 and increased use of outsourcing where appropriate and cost
effective had a favorable impact on operating expense growth

    research and development expense grew 8 in fiscal 2000 compared to 1999 and
3 in 1999 when compared to 1998 in both fiscal 2000 and 1999 growth in
research and development expense was due primarily to an increase in spending
that reflects our continuing investment in the design and development of new
technologies in computing systems and imaging and printing systems

    selling general and administrative expenses increased 13 in 2000 compared
to 1999 and 11 in 1999 when compared to 1998 the selling general and
administrative expenses growth rate in 1999 was 10 after adjusting for costs
related to the agilent technologies spinoff which were included in hps
continuing operations these costs consisted of spinoff expenses incurred prior
to the july 31 1999 measurement date for discontinued operations accounting and
other expenses composed primarily of retention incentives given to continuing hp
employees involved in effecting the spinoff in both 2000 and 1999 the growth
was due primarily to increased selling costs to support business growth as well
as increased marketing expenses from the continued introduction of new products
and to support our eservices strategy in fiscal 2000 we also incurred
additional marketing expenses to support our corporate branding initiative

           financial condition and results of operations continued

interest income and other net

    interest income and other net increased 285 million in fiscal 2000 versus
1999 following a 178 million increase in 1999 when compared to 1998 the
increase in fiscal 2000 was primarily attributable to gains on divestitures of
nonstrategic businesses an increase in interest income due to higher average
cash and investment balances and gains on the sale of equity securities offset
by losses on certain investments in emerging market companies as a result of
current market conditions we may incur additional charges on our investments in
emerging market companies in the future the increase in fiscal 1999 was due
mainly to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average cash and
investment balances

taxes

    hps tax rate was 230 in 2000 260 in 1999 and 275 in 1998 the
yeartoyear decreases were primarily the result of changes in the mix of our
pretax earnings in various tax jurisdictions throughout the world

net earnings from continuing operations

    as reported net earnings from continuing operations increased 15 to
36 billion in 2000 compared to a 16 increase to 31 billion in 1999 as a
percentage of net revenue net earnings from continuing operations were 73 in
both fiscal 2000 and 1999 and 68 in 1998

net earnings from discontinued operations

    in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 the cumulative net earnings of agilent
technologies since the july 31 1999 measurement date began to exceed the total
estimated net costs to effect the spinoff net earnings from discontinued
operations for fiscal 2000 were 136 million of this 136 million net earnings
of agilent technologies for the period from july 31 1999 through the june 2
2000 spinoff date totaled 287 million net of related tax expense of
174 million and the net costs to effect the spinoff were 151 million net
of related tax benefit of 23 million net earnings from discontinued
operations for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 consisted only of the net earnings of
agilent technologies see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in

    imaging and printing systems net revenue grew 10 in fiscal 2000 from 1999
following an 11 increase in 1999 when compared to 1998 net revenue growth in
both years was driven primarily by strong sales of printer supplies fiscal 2000
revenues also benefited from growth in imaging devices partially offset by a
decline in business printer sales overall unfavorable foreign currency
effects particularly in europe moderated the segments revenue growth in
fiscal 2000 in addition to strong performance in supplies the increase in
fiscal 1999 revenues was attributable to growth in home printers overall
despite strong unit growth across many product categories in both years dollar
growth was constrained by declines in average selling prices and shifts to
lowend products

    net revenue growth in printer supplies in both years reflected continued
expansion in the installed base the fiscal 2000 revenue growth in imaging
devices was fueled by excellent unit growth from newly introduced products
within allinone products and photosmart printers and cameras the increase in
imaging revenues was partially offset by planned pricing declines in allinone
products and a shift to lowerpriced scanners a softening of demand in the
business printer market further moderated fiscal 2000 revenues within this
category there was strong growth in color laser printers however this growth
did not fully offset the impact of an expected decline in monochrome laser
sales in addition to strong sales in supplies in fiscal 1999 home printers
benefited from positive acceptance of newly introduced lowend desktop printers
while color lasers made solid inroads in the business printer category higher
unit shipments of new products drove the increase in scanning devices in fiscal
1999 despite a sharp decline in average selling prices

    earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 134 in 2000
compared to 126 in 1999 and 122 in 1998 in 1998 imaging and printing
systems incurred approximately 120 million of charges primarily for voluntary
employee severance programs and fixed asset writedowns related to outsourcing
certain production operations the decision to outsource these operations was
made to provide flexibility in manufacturing in the future adjusting for these
charges earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue would have been
129 in 1998

    the earnings from operations ratio improved by 08 percentage points in
fiscal year 2000 compared to 1999 this improvement reflected strong operating
expense management offset by a slight decline in the overall gross margin this
margin decline was attributable to a shift toward lowermargin home printers and
imaging devices as well as higher component costs related to the strong
japanese yen however this negative impact on gross margins was almost fully
offset by favorable gross margins in printer supplies due to economies of scale
from increased production levels the adjusted 03 percentage point decline in
the fiscal year 1999 earnings from operations ratio compared to 1998 resulted
primarily from gross margin declines these margin declines were due to higher
component costs attributable to the strengthening japanese yen and a shift
toward lowermargin business printers this decrease in gross margins was
partially offset by strong sales of highermargin printer supplies in fiscal
1999 earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was impacted
favorably by strong operating expense management however this positive impact
was offset by investments made to develop next generation technologies and
additional selling and marketing expenses to promote new imaging and printing
products

    computing systems net revenue increased 18 in fiscal 2000 following a 3
increase in 1999 when compared to 1998 strong performance in home and notebook
pcs and solid sales in unixregistered trademark server products drove the
overall revenue growth in 2000 this revenue growth was moderated in part by the
continued transition to a new enterprise storage strategy and declining revenue
performance in business desktop pcs in 1999 strong unit shipments of pc and
information storage products fueled revenue growth revenue growth in 1999 was
partially offset by declines in the average selling prices as a result of
actions designed to maintain market share in addition
unixregistered trademark server and enterprise storage revenue in 1999 was
impacted unfavorably by the change in highend storage strategy and certain
product transitions

    in fiscal 2000 computing systems revenue growth reflected very strong unit
shipments of home and notebook pcs which was partially offset by lower average
selling prices as a result of competitive pressures growth in home pcs was
driven by favorable acceptance of new products aided by the exit of two major
competitors from the retail market notebook pcs continued to benefit from
strong sales of the base portfolio as well as introduction of the retail
notebook line in addition excellent performance in both the entrylevel and
midrange unixregistered trademark servers resulted from increased unit sales
and higher average selling prices due to richer product configurations highend
unixregistered trademark servers however exhibited some weakness in 2000
attributable primarily to customer anticipation of the new highend server
introduced in the fourth quarter of 2000 revenue growth in fiscal 2000 was
impacted unfavorably by declining revenue performance in business desktop pcs
resulting from component shortages and lower average selling prices moreover
the continued transition to a new enterprise storage strategy had a negative
effect on fiscal 2000 although enterprise storage revenues experienced
accelerating growth in the second half of the year in fiscal 1999 computing
systems revenue growth benefited from strong unit shipments of home pcs
information storage products notebook pcs and highend
unixregistered trademark servers however weakness in the sales of lowend
and midrange unixregistered trademark servers due to product transitions
falling average selling prices and a transition to a new highend storage
strategy had a moderating impact on overall revenue growth in 1999

    earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 46 in 2000
compared to 48 in 1999 and 28 in 1998 the slight decrease in the earnings
from operations ratio for 2000 is attributable to higher memory costs as well
as a shift to lowermargin products and declining average selling prices
particularly in home and notebook pcs this margin decline was partially offset
by a shift to highermargin unixregistered trademark server and enterprise
storage products in addition operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue
decreased from 1999 due to improved operational efficiencies the
20 percentage point increase in the earnings from operations ratio for 1999
compared to 1998 reflected favorable component prices improved pc inventory
management and a shift towards highermargin enterprise storage products this
was moderated in part by declining average selling prices and a shift to lowend
pc products expense controls implemented during the second half of 1998 and
improved operational efficiencies also had a favorable impact on the earnings
from operations ratio in 1999

    it services net revenue increased 14 in fiscal 2000 versus 1999 following
a 10 increase in 1999 compared to 1998 the increase in net revenue was driven
by continued growth in customer support as well as strong performance in
consulting services and hps financing business support revenues continued to
benefit from strength in mission critical and networking services despite
competitive pricing pressures growth in consulting reflected strong demand for
communications solutions implementation of enterprise resource planning erp
and customer relationship management crm applications and new eservices
software development it services overall growth in fiscal 2000 reflected
strength in the unixregistered trademark business through an increase in
support contracts and customer financing arrangements overall growth also was
impacted favorably by increased revenues from sales of complementary third party
products delivered with sales of hp solutions in fiscal 1999 strong growth in
support revenue and outsourcing services was moderated by lower growth rates in
consulting and financing support revenue reflected the strong performance of
mission critical and networking services the financing business was unfavorably
impacted by lower rental starts and a more competitive
unixregistered trademark environment

    earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 89 in 2000
compared to 92 in 1999 and 132 in 1998 the decline in the earnings from
operations ratio in fiscal 2000 was due to increases in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue partially offset by gross margin improvements
operating expenses increased due to bad debt writeoffs in our financing
portfolio and higher marketing expense to support hps corporate branding
initiative gross margin improvements were achieved in our services business
resulting primarily from improved engagement cost management and consolidation
of data centers in outsourcing these margin increases were partially offset by
lower margins on our complementary products business and an increase in hiring
in our support business in anticipation of future growth

    the decrease in the fiscal 1999 earnings from operations ratio reflected
lease portfolio recoverability costs related primarily to the transition to a
new highend enterprise storage strategy reduced profitability attributable to
slower growth of new services competitive pricing and an increase in headcount
in our services businesses to support future growth also negatively impacted
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue in addition operating
expenses increased in 1999 versus 1998 as a result of investment in service and
support technologies and marketing expenses related to hps eservices
initiatives

liquidity and capital resources

    our financial position remained strong throughout 2000 as cash and cash
equivalents and shortterm investments were 40 billion at october 31 2000
compared to 56 billion at october 31 1999 during fiscal 2000 cash flows
from operating activities and net proceeds from divestitures of nonstrategic
portions of our business were used to fund repurchases of hps common stock and
purchases of property plant and equipment

           financial condition and results of operations continued

    operating activities generated 35 billion of cash in 2000 compared to
31 billion in 1999 and 48 billion in 1998 the increase in cash generated
from operations in 2000 was due mainly to timing of tax payments and accounts
payable offset by increases in inventory and other assets the decrease in cash
generated from operations in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted primarily from
timing of tax payments and higher investments in receivables and inventories due
to growth

    inventory as a percentage of net revenue was 117 in 2000 comparable to
115 in 1999 the inventory ratio was very stable in both years reflecting
solid supply chain management accounts and financing receivables as a
percentage of net revenue were 176 in 2000 and 185 in 1999

    capital expenditures were 17 billion in 2000 compared to 11 billion in
1999 and 16 billion in 1998 net property plant and equipment as a percentage
of net revenue was 92 in 2000 compared to 102 in 1999 this decline reflects
our continuing effort to streamline operations through outsourcing and
consolidating activities improving space utilization and reducing asset
intensity to build flexibility into our balance sheet

    we invest excess cash in short and longterm investments depending on our
projected cash needs for operations capital expenditures and other business
purposes we also supplement our internally generated cash flow with a
combination of short and longterm borrowings the increase in longterm
borrowings in 2000 is due primarily to the issuance of 15 billion of global
notes described below maturities of longterm debt totaling 05 billion were
repaid as scheduled in 2000 shortterm borrowings increased in 1999 due to the
use of shortterm debt to meet shortterm working capital requirements
maturities of longterm debt of 10 billion were repaid as scheduled in 1999
at october 31 2000 we had an unused committed borrowing facility in place
totaling 10 billion

    in february 2000 we filed a shelf registration statement with the
securities and exchange commission sec to register 30 billion of debt
securities common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants this
registration statement was declared effective on march 17 2000 on june 6
2000 we offered under the registration statement 15 billion of unsecured
715 global notes which mature june 15 2005 unless previously redeemed this
offering closed on june 9 2000 the net proceeds from the sale of the notes
were used for general corporate purposes which included repayment of existing
indebtedness capital expenditures and working capital needs we have the
capacity to issue an additional 15 billion of securities under the shelf
registration statement

    we repurchase shares of our common stock under a systematic program to
manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and
under a separate incremental plan authorizing purchases in the open market or in
private transactions in fiscal 2000 we repurchased 96978000 shares under
these plans for an aggregate price of 56 billion in 1999 we repurchased
62084000 shares under these plans for 26 billion the share repurchase
amounts for fiscal 2000 and 1999 have been adjusted to reflect the twoforone
stock split in the form of a stock dividend effective october 27 2000
discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 below
during 2000 hps board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion of
future repurchases under these two programs in the aggregate as of october 31
2000 we had authorization for remaining future repurchases under the two
programs of approximately 09 billion in november 2000 the board of directors
authorized an additional 20 billion in future repurchases under the plans
resulting in remaining authorized repurchases totaling 29 billion

    in december 2000 the board of directors authorized a repurchase program for
our zerocoupon subordinated convertible notes under the repurchase program we
may repurchase the notes from time to time at varying prices as of january 19
2001 we had repurchased approximately 600 million in face

    in november 1999 agilent technologies completed an initial public offering
of approximately 16 of its common stock and distributed the net proceeds of
approximately 21 billion to hp we provided initial funding in november 1999
to agilent technologies and retained certain assets and liabilities of agilent
technologies as of november 1 1999 which were subsequently liquidated the
aggregate impact of these transactions resulted in cash flows from discontinued
operations of approximately 10 billion and an increase in additional
paidincapital of approximately 13 billion we distributed substantially all
of our remaining interest in agilent technologies through a stock dividend to hp
stockholders on june 2 2000 resulting in the elimination of the net assets of
discontinued operations and a 42 billion reduction of retained earnings

factors that could affect future results

competition

    we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business we have
numerous competitors ranging from some of the worlds largest corporations to
many relatively small and highly specialized firms we compete primarily on the
basis of technology performance price quality reliability distribution
customer service and support product life cycles are short to remain
competitive we must be able to develop new products services and support as
well as periodically enhance our existing products services and support in
particular we anticipate that we will have to continue to lower the prices of
many of our products services and support to stay competitive and effectively
manage financial returns with resulting reduced gross margins in some of our
markets we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors and the competitive pressures we face could harm our business and
prospects

new product and service introductions

    if we cannot continue to rapidly develop manufacture and market innovative
products and services that meet customer requirements for performance and
reliability we may lose market share and our future revenue and earnings may
suffer the process of developing new high technology products and services is
complex and uncertain we must accurately anticipate customers changing needs
and emerging technological trends we consequently must make longterm
investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our
predictions will eventually result in products that the market will accept
after a product is developed we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes
quickly at low enough costs to do this we must accurately forecast volumes mix
of products and configurations additionally the supply and timing of a new
product or service must match customers demand and timing for the particular
product or service given the wide variety of systems products and services
that hp offers the process of planning production and managing inventory levels
becomes increasingly difficult

reliance on third party distribution channels and inventory management

    we use thirdparty distributors to sell our products especially printers
and personal computers in order to accommodate changing customer preferences
as a result the financial soundness of our wholesale and retail distributors
and our continuing relationships with these distributors are important to hps
success some of these distributors may have insufficient financial resources
and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions our revenue and
earnings could suffer if our distributors financial condition or operations
weaken or if our relationships with them deteriorate

                    managements discussion and analysis of

           financial condition and results of operations continued

    additionally inventory management becomes increasingly complex as we
continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors third party
distributors constantly adjust their product orders from us in response to

     the supply of our and our competitors products available to the
      distributor

     the timing of new product introductions and relative features of the
      products and

     seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand such as backtoschool and
      holiday buying

    distributors may increase orders during times of product shortages cancel
orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new
products if we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and
write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins

short product life cycles

    the short life cycles of many of our products pose a challenge for us to
manage effectively the transition from existing products to new products if we
do not manage the transition effectively our revenue and earnings could suffer
among the factors that make a smooth transition from current products to new
products difficult are delays in product development or manufacturing
variations in product costs and delays in customer purchases of existing
products in anticipation of new product introductions our revenue and earnings
could also suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our
suppliers and competitors this is especially true when a competitor introduces
a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore our new
products may replace or compete with a certain number of our own current
products

intellectual property

    we generally rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in
the us and in certain other countries and agreements with our employees
customers and partners to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our
technology and products however any of our intellectual proprietary rights
could be challenged invalidated or circumvented our intellectual property may
not necessarily provide significant competitive advantages also because of the
rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry many
of our products rely on key technologies developed by third parties and we may
not be able to continue to obtain licenses from these third parties third
parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property even if we
do not believe that our products are infringing third parties intellectual
property rights the claims can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and
divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of
intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly
royalty or license agreements if we cannot or do not license the infringed
technology or substitute similar technology from another source our business
could suffer

reliance on suppliers

    our manufacturing operations depend on our suppliers ability to deliver
quality components and products in time for us to meet critical manufacturing
and distribution schedules we sometimes experience a short supply of certain
component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts if
shortages or delays persist our operating results could suffer until other
sources can be developed in order to secure components for the production of
new products at times we make advance payments to suppliers or we may enter
into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors if the prices of these
component parts then decrease after we have entered into binding price
agreements our earnings could suffer furthermore we may not be able to secure
enough components at reasonable prices to build new

           financial condition and results of operations continued

products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations needed
conversely a temporary oversupply of these parts also could adversely affect
our operating results

international

    sales outside the us make up more than half of our revenues a portion of
our product and component manufacturing along with key suppliers are also
located outside of the us our future earnings or financial position could be
adversely affected by a variety of international factors including

     changes in a countrys or regions political or economic conditions

     trade protection measures

     import or export licensing requirements

     the overlap of different tax structures

     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

     differing technology standards

     problems caused by the conversion of various european currencies to the
      euro see adoption of the euro section below and

     natural disasters

market risk

    we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales
commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to interest rate risk
inherent in our debt and investment portfolios our risk management strategy
uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased
options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures our
intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures
with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do
not enter into derivatives for trading purposes we are also exposed to equity
securities price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities we
typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these
securities see also notes 4 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements in
item 8 below for more detailed information

    we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse
movement in foreign exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and
underlying exposures described above and a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in
interest rates applied to our debt and investment portfolios as of october 31
2000 and 1999 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements
would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results
of operations or cash flows actual gains and losses in the future may differ
materially from that analysis however based on changes in the timing and
amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our
actual exposures and hedges

impairment of investment and financing portfolios

    we have an investment portfolio which includes minority equity and debt
investments in numerous technology companies in particular we have invested in
various privately held companies many of which are still in the startup or
development stage these investments are inherently risky because the markets
for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in
the early stages and may never develop furthermore the values of our
investments in publiclytraded companies are subject to

           financial condition and results of operations continued

significant market price volatility we may incur losses related to our
investments in these companies our investments in technology companies are
often coupled with a strategic commercial relationship our commercial
agreements with these companies may not be sufficient to allow us to obtain and
integrate such products or technology into our technology or product lines and
these companies may be subsequently acquired by third parties including
competitors of ours

    moreover we often provide financing for the purchase of our products and
services to technology companies due to the recent economic downturn
particularly in the us and difficulties that may be faced by some of these
companies our financing portfolio could be further impaired

acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures

    in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with
third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint
ventures and divestitures although completion of any one transaction may not
have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash
flows taken as a whole it may contribute to our financial results differing
from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter divestiture of
a part of our business may result in the cancellation of orders and charges to
earnings acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate with
a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may
also have to develop manufacture and market products with our products in a way
that enhances the performance of the combined business or product line
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful
integration of the entity into hp depends on a variety of factors including

     the hiring and retention of key employees

     management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas and

     the integration or coordination of different research and development and
      product manufacturing facilities

    all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which
may divert our attention from other business operations

earthquakes and power outages

    our corporate headquarters a portion of our research and development
activities other critical business operations and a certain number of our
suppliers are located in california the ultimate impact on hp our significant
suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake
faults is unknown but operating results could be materially adversely affected
in the event of a major earthquake in addition california has recently
experienced ongoing power shortages which have resulted in rolling blackouts
these blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of
our suppliers distributors and resellers and customers we are predominantly
uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes and power outages

environmental

    some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state
and international laws governing the environment it is our policy to apply
strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the
us even when not subject to local government regulations we record a
liability for environmental remediation and related costs when we consider the
costs to be probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated
environmental costs are presently not material to our results of operations or
financial position

profit margin

    our profit margins vary somewhat among our products customer groups and
geographic markets consequently our overall profitability in any given period
is partially dependent on the product customer and geographic mix reflected in
that periods net revenue

stock price

    hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile
some of the factors that can affect our stock price are

     our or a competitors announcement of new products services or
      technological innovations

     quarterly increases or decreases in our earnings

     changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and

     speculation in the press or investment community about our financial
      condition or results of operations

    general market conditions and domestic or international macroeconomic
factors unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price for these
reasons investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock
prices or financial results in addition following periods of volatility in a
companys securities securities class action litigation against a company is
sometimes instituted this type of litigation could result in substantial costs
and the diversion of management time and resources

economic uncertainty

    the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends significantly
on the overall demand for computing and imaging products and services
particularly in the product and service segments in which we compete softening
demand for these products and services caused by worsening economic conditions
may result in decreased revenues or earnings levels or growth rates recently
the us economy has weakened this has resulted in individuals and companies
delaying or reducing expenditures such as for information technology

    hp has reported that based on worsening economic conditions and a decrease
in corporate and consumer information technology spending primarily in the
us hp expects to achieve slower revenue growth rates for the first half of
fiscal year 2001 and earnings per share below previous estimates for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2001 further delays or reductions in information
technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our
products and services and consequently on our business operating results
financial condition prospects and stock price

earnings fluctuations

    although we believe that we have the products and resources needed for
continuing success we cannot reliably predict future revenue and margin trends
actual trends may cause us to adjust our operations which could cause
periodtoperiod fluctuations in our earnings

spinoff of agilent technologies

    on june 2 2000 we distributed to our stockholders of record as of the
close of business on may 2 2000 substantially all of the common stock of
agilent technologies owned by hp we may not obtain the benefits we expect as a
result of this distribution such as greater strategic focus on our core
computing and imaging and printing businesses

                    managements discussion and analysis of

           financial condition and results of operations continued

    in conjunction with the spinoff of agilent technologies we entered into
transitional service agreements with agilent technologies to support ongoing
operations of agilent technologies relating to certain administrative processes
these transitional service agreements generally have terms of two years or less
following the spinoff as each of these service agreements expires the fees
and cost reimbursements currently being paid to us by agilent technologies for
the associated services will also cease

adoption of the euro

    we had established a dedicated task force to address the issues raised by
the introduction of a european single currency the euro the euros initial
implementation was effective as of january 1 1999 and the transition period
will continue through january 1 2002 on january 1 1999 we began converting
our product prices from local currencies to euros as required we implemented
system changes to give multicurrency capability to internal applications and to
ensure that external partners systems processing euro conversions are compliant
with the european council regulations in addition we have implemented design
changes to support display and printing of the euro character by impacted hp
products

    the introduction and use of the euro has not had a material effect on our
foreign exchange and hedging activities or our use of derivative instruments
and we do not presently expect that it will all costs associated with the
conversion to the euro are expensed to operations as incurred while we will
continue to evaluate the impact of the euro over time based on currently
available information we do not believe that the introduction of the euro
currency will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
condition cash flows or results of operations

recent accounting pronouncements

    in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities this statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires
recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings
if the derivative is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in
fair value will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings hp
adopted the standard on november 1 2000 and the adoption did not materially
impact our consolidated financial statements

    in december 1999 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 101
revenue recognition in financial statements this bulletin summarizes certain
of the secs views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the
us to revenue recognition in financial statements based on the secs latest
timeline for implementing sab 101 hp would be required to comply with the
guidelines in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 accordingly we are
continuing to evaluate the potential impact that adoption will have on our
consolidated financial statements

item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
  financial disclosure

    on september 21 2000 the audit committee of hps board of directors
terminated pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc as hps independent public
accountants with respect to the audit of hps consolidated financial statements
for the fiscal year ended october 31 2000 the 2000 audit the decision was
made because of concerns by both hp and pwc regarding the timing of the
completion of the 2000 audit in light of the potential loss of pwcs
independence since hp was in discussion with pwc over a possible acquisition of
its global management and information consulting practice the potential
acquisition pwc had already ceased all audit work for hp on september 12
2000 hp subsequently terminated discussions with pwc with respect to the
potential acquisition because hp and pwc could not reach a mutually acceptable
agreement

    on september 21 2000 the audit committee also selected and appointed
ernst  young llp ey to serve as hps independent public accountants with
respect to the 2000 audit at that time hp committed to undertake a more formal
evaluation process in selecting independent public accountants with respect to
the audit of hps consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending
october 31 2001 the 2001 audit hp has initiated but has not completed the
process of evaluating independent accountants with respect to the 2001 audit and
therefore independent public accountants with respect to the 2001 audit have not
been definitively selected at this time however on december 21 2000 the
audit committee approved the extension of the appointment of ey on an interim
basis for the fiscal quarter ended january 31 2001 with respect to the 2001
audit until the evaluation process has been completed which may or may not
result in a change to eys existing appointment

    neither the report of ey with respect to the 2000 audit nor the reports of
pwc with respect to the audits of hps consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal years ended october 31 1999 or october 31 1998 contained an adverse
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or were qualified or modified as to
uncertainty audit scope or accounting principles in addition during hps
fiscal years ended october 31 1999 and october 31 1998 and through
september 21 2000 there were no disagreements with pwc on any matter of
accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure with respect to hps consolidated financial statements which
disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of pwc would have caused it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with
its reports

    prior to retaining ey with respect to the 2000 audit hp consulted with ey
on various aspects of the potential acquisition including tax and accounting
matters related to a variety of preliminary structures for the potential
acquisition hp did not consult with pwc on such issues
