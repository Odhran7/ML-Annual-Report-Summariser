clean energy commitment a threepronged approach aimed at ultimately eliminating carbonemitting resources from its electric generation resource portfolio 

aps’s clean energy goals consist of three parts 

• a 2050 goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity 

• a 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65 clean energy with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy and 

• a commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 

among other strategies aps intends to achieve these goals through various methods such as relying on palo verde the nation’s largest producer of carbonfree energy increasing clean energy resources including renewables developing energy storage ceasing the use of coalgenerated electricity managing demand with a modern interactive grid promoting customer technology and energy efficiency and optimizing regional resources management takes into consideration climate change and other environmental risks in its strategy development business planning and enterprise risk management processes see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information about aps’s clean energy commitment 

over this same period of time aps also intends to harden its infrastructure in order to improve climate resiliency which involves system and operational improvements aimed at reducing the impact of extreme weather events and other climaterelated disruptions upon aps’s operations among other resiliency strategies aps anticipates increasing investments in a modern and more flexible electricity grid with advanced distribution technologies aps plans to continue its comprehensive forest management programs aimed at reducing wildfires as those risks become compounded by shorter drier winters and longer hotter summers as a result of climate change 

aps prepares an annual inventory of ghg emissions from its operations for aps’s operations involving fossilfuel electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution aps’s annual ghg inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program aps also voluntarily tracks the full scope of aps’s ghg emissions arising from all aps operations in addition to reporting to the epa we publicly report scope 1 2 and 3 ghg emissions this data is then communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcomcorporateresponsibility  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2 

  

nuclear 

palo verde generating station — palo verde is a 3unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and approximately 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases approximately 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 

table of contents 

291 combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

  

palo verde leases — in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities the leaseback was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 and contained options to renew the leases or to purchase the leased property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms on july 7 2014 aps exercised the fixed rate lease renewal options the exercise of the renewal options originally resulted in aps retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases on april 1 2021 aps executed an amendment relating to the lease agreement with the term ending in 2023 the amendment extends the lease term for this lease through 2033 and changes the lease payment as a result of this amendment aps will now retain the assets through 2033 under all three lease agreements at the end of the lease renewal periods aps will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value extend the leases for up to two years or return the assets to the lessors see note 18 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle — the participant owners of palo verde are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

• mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

• conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

• enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

• fabrication of fuel assemblies 

• utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

• storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2028 and 86 through 2029 100 of palo verde’s requirements for conversion services through 2026 and 30 through 2030 100 of palo verde’s requirements for enrichment services through 2026 and 76 for 2027 and 100 of palo verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 for unit 2 and unit 1 and 2028 for unit 3 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and highlevel waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several legal 

table of contents 

proceedings followed challenging doe’s withdrawal of its yucca mountain construction authorization application and the nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application which were consolidated into one matter at the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” following the dc circuit’s august 2013 order the nrc issued two volumes of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application publication of these volumes do not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository aps is directly involved in legal proceedings related to the doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and highlevel waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the palo verde participants filed a lawsuit against the doe in the united states court of federal claims “court of federal claims” for damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe in the court of federal claims this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract for failing to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel and highlevel waste from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the standard contract and the nwpa on august 18 2014 aps and the doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment by the doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 in addition the settlement agreement provides aps with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through december 31 2016 which was extended to december 31 2022 

aps has submitted seven claims pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement for seven separate time periods during july 1 2011 through june 30 2020 the doe has approved and paid 1118 million for these claims aps’s share is 325 million the amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income in accordance with the 2017 rate case decision this regulatory liability is being refunded to customers see note 4 on november 1 2021 aps filed its eighth claim pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement in the amount of 122 million aps’s share is 36 million in february 2022 the doe approved this claim 

waste confidence and continued storage — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of highlevel nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with national environmental policy act in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel renamed as the continued storage rule the nrc’s decision adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be

reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses the final continued storage rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals in june 2016 the dc circuit issued its final decision rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the continued storage rule on august 8 2016 the dc circuit denied a petition for rehearing 

  

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility we are on track to meet the current sitespecific decommissioning costs for palo verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned see note 19 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts

expressing any view on the future recoverability of aps’s remaining investment in the unit aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 following the closure of unit 2 aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 381 mw in early 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating aps’s compromise proposal which took effect for cholla on april 26 2017 in december 2019 pacificorp notified aps that it planned to retire cholla unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in december 2020 aps has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining cholla units by 2025 

aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 in addition aps has a coal transportation contract that runs through 2024 

navajo plant — the navajo plant was a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operated the plant and aps owned a 14 interest in units 1 2 and 3 aps had a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant would remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 which allowed for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations in november 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 4 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and which may be material 

see note 11 for information regarding aps’s coal mine reclamation obligations related to these coalfired plants 

solar facilities 

aps developed utility scale solar resources through the 170 mw accapproved az sun program investing approximately 675 million in this program these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona in addition to the az sun program aps developed the 40 mw red rock solar plant which it owns and operates two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from aps that are equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that red rock is projected to generate 

aps owns and operates more than thirty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar systems in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 was a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona the pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 rate case decision the participants have been transferred to the solar partner program described below additionally aps owns

13 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing an apsowned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid the first stage of the program called the “solar partner program” placed 8 mw of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as made systems available to limitedincome customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties the second stage of the program which included an additional 2 mw of rooftop solar and energy storage placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 mw on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various gridrelated operation improvements and system interoperability and was in operation by the end of 2016 the costs for this program have been included in aps’s rate base as part of the 2017 rate case decision 

in the 2017 rate case decision the acc also approved the “aps solar communities” program aps solar communities formerly az sun ii is a threeyear program authorizing aps to spend 10 million to 15 million in capital costs each year to install utilityowned dg systems on low to moderate income residential homes nonprofit entities title i schools and rural government facilities the 2017 rate case decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses property taxes marketing and advertising expenses and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the res currently aps has installed 11 mw of dg systems under the aps solar communities program in the 2019 rate case decision the acc authorized aps to spend 20 million to 30 million in capital costs for the aps solar communities program each year for a period of three years from the effective date of the decision 

energy storage 

aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage energy storage provides capacity improves power quality can be utilized for system regulation and in certain circumstances be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements increase renewable utilization and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid 

in 2018 aps issued a request for proposal “rfp” for approximately 106 mw of energy storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon its evaluation of the rfp responses aps decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site these battery storage facilities are expected to be in service during the summer of 2022 on august 2 2021 aps executed a contract for an additional 60 mw of utilityowned energy storage to be located on aps’s az sun sites this contract with a 2023 inservice date will complete the addition of storage on current apsowned utilityscale solar facilities 

additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year ppas for energy storage totaling 150 mw these ppas were subject to acc approval in order to allow for cost recovery through the psa aps received the requested acc approval on january 12 2021 and service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2022 with respect to 100 mw and in 2023 with respect to 50 mw

energy imbalance market 

in 2016 aps began to participate in the western energy imbalance market “eim” a voluntary realtime optimization market operated by the caiso the eim allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15minute blocks and dispatching generation every five minutes instead of the traditional onehour blocks aps continues to expect that its participation in eim will lower its fuel and purchasedpower costs improve situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources aps is in discussions with the eim operator caiso and other eim participants about the feasibility of creating a voluntary dayahead market to achieve more cost savings and use the region’s renewable resources more efficiently 

energy modernization plan 

on july 30 2020 the acc staff issued final draft energy rules which proposed 100 of retail kwh sales from clean energy resources by the end of 2050 nuclear power was defined as a clean energy resource the proposed rules also required 50 of retail energy served be renewable by the end of 2035 on november 13 2020 the acc approved a final draft energy rules package which required additional procedural steps in the rulemaking process in june 2021 the acc adopted clean energy rules based on a series of acc amendments to the final energy rules the adopted rules require 100 clean energy by 2070 and the following interim standards for carbon reduction from baseline carbon emissions level 50 reduction by december 31 2032 65 reduction by december 31 2040 80 reduction by december 31 2050 and 95 reduction by december 31 2060 since the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original recommended order and opinion supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective on january 26 2022 the acc reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process instead the acc opened a new docket to consider allsource rfp requirements and the irp process see note 4 for additional information related to these energy rules 

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 12 of retail electric sales in 2022 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 

  

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 12 in 2022 on june 7 2021 the acc approved the 2021 res implementation plan on july 1 

table of contents 

2021 aps filed its 2022 res implementation plan and amended it on december 9 2021 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard and its timing 



on april 21 2015 the res rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy the rules allow the acc to consider such information in determining whether aps has satisfied the requirements of the res 

renewable energy portfolio to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 2758 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 2218 mw are currently in operation and 540 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 247 mw of facilities owned by aps 736 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 1235 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — solar facilities” above for information regarding apsowned solar facilities 

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development as of december 31 2021 agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates see note 4 for information regarding acc’s regulation of aps’s retail electric rates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

on november 17 2018 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona on july 1 and july 2 2019 acc staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules on february 10 2020 two acc commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules on february 12 2020 acc staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules during a july 15 2020 acc staff meeting the acc commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program but no action was taken the acc continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition including the potential for additional buythrough programs or other pilot programs at the same time the arizona legislature is considering a bill that would nullify if approved a 20yearold electric deregulation law that has been in place since

1998 the bill has several procedural steps in the legislative process before becoming law aps cannot predict whether these efforts will result in any changes and if changes to the rules results what impact these rules would have on aps 

on august 4 2021 green mountain energy filed an application seeking a certificate of convenience and necessity to allow it to provide competitive electric generation service in arizona green mountain energy has requested that the acc grant it the ability to provide competitive service in aps’s and tucson electric power company’s certificated service territories and proposes to deliver a 100 renewable energy product to residential and general service customers in those service territories aps opposes green mountain energy’s application and intends to intervene to contest it on november 3 2021 the acc submitted questions to the office of the arizona attorney general civil litigation division consumer protection  advocacy section attorney general requesting legal opinions related to a number of issues surrounding retail electric competition and the acc’s ability to issue competitive certificates convenience and necessity on november 26 2021 the administrative law judge issued a procedural order indicating it would not be appropriate to set a schedule until the attorney general has provided his insights on the applicable law 

on october 28 2021 an acc commissioner docketed a letter directing acc staff and interested stakeholders to design a 200300 mw pilot program that would allow residential and small commercial customers of aps to elect a competitive electricity supplier the letter also states that similar programs should be designed for other arizona regulated electric utilities aps cannot predict the outcome of these future activities 

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 4 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2021 approximately 76 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and natural gas the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

transmission and delivery 

aps continues to work closely with customers stakeholders and regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that support new customers system reliability access to markets and clean energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report includes new aps transmission projects along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements including those for data center and semiconductor manufacturing development aps is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage minimize system outage durations and frequency enable customer choice for new customer sited technologies and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain delivery functions

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative initiatives there have been no recent successful attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate ghg emissions and it is unclear at this time whether legislation regulating or limiting utilitysector ghg emissions under consideration in the 117th congress will become law in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is written enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include without limitation the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation regulating ghgs the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 19 2019 epa took final action on its proposals to repeal epa’s 2015 clean power plan “cpp” and replace those regulations with a new rule the affordable clean energy “ace” regulations epa originally finalized the cpp on august 3 2015 and such rules would have had far broader impact on the electric power sector than the ace regulations on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the ace regulations and remanded them back to epa to develop new existing power plant carbon regulations consistent with the court’s ruling that ruling endorsed an expansive view of the federal clean air act consistent with epa’s 2015 cpp on october 29 2021 the us supreme court announced that it was accepting judicial review of the january dc circuit decision vacating the ace regulations while the biden administration has expressed an intent to regulate carbon emissions in this sector more aggressively under the clean air act we cannot at this time predict the outcome of pending epa rulemaking proceedings or ongoing litigation related to the scope of epa’s authority under the clean air act to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants 

other environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations the ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” and other rules or matters involving the clean air act clean water act endangered species act rcra superfund the navajo

nation and water supplies for our power plants the financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of our coal plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly our coal plants may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules  in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis final regulations imposing bart requirements have now been imposed on each aps coalfired power plant four corners was required to install new pollution controls to comply with bart while similar pollution control installation requirements were not necessary for cholla 

cholla in early 2017 epa approved a final rule containing a revision to arizona’s state implementation plan “sip” for cholla that implemented bart requirements for this facility which did not require the installation of any new pollution control capital improvements in conjunction with the closure of cholla unit 2 in 2015 aps has committed to ceasing coal combustion within units 1 and 3 by april 2025 pacificorp retired cholla unit 4 at the end of 2020 see “cholla” in note 4 for information regarding future plans for cholla and details related to the resulting regulatory asset 

  

four corners  based on epa’s final standards aps’s 63 share of the cost of required bart controls for four corners units 4 and 5 was approximately 400 million which has been incurred see note 4 for information regarding the related rate recovery in addition aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 ntec purchased the interest from 4ca on july 3 2018 see “four corners — 4ca matter” in note 11 for a discussion of the ntec purchase the cost of the pollution controls related to the 7 interest is approximately 45 million which was assumed by ntec through its purchase of the 7 interest 

coal combustion waste on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the rcra and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions these criteria include standards governing location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity such closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below 

since these regulations were finalized epa has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing ccr disposal while certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions 

table of contents 

others have resulted from judicial review courtapproved settlements with environmental groups and statutory changes to rcra the following lists the pending regulatory changes that if finalized could have a material impact as to how aps manages ccr at its coalfired power plants 

• following the passage of the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act in 2016 epa possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for ccr management or issue federal permits governing ccr disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands although adeq has taken steps to develop a ccr permitting program it is not clear when that program will be put into effect on december 19 2019 epa proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of ccr management permits 

• on march 1 2018 as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups epa proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by ccr disposal activities apart from a subsequent proposal issued on august 14 2019 to add a specific healthbased groundwater protection standard for boron epa has yet to take action on this proposal 

• based on an august 21 2018 dc circuit decision which vacated and remanded those provisions of the epa ccr regulations that allow for the operation of unlined ccr surface impoundments epa recently proposed corresponding changes to federal ccr regulations on july 29 2020 epa took final action on new regulations establishing revised deadlines for initiating the closure of unlined ccr surface impoundments by april 11 2021 at the latest all aps disposal units subject to these closure requirements were closed as of april 11 2021 

• on november 4 2019 epa also proposed to change the manner by which facilities that have committed to cease burning coal in the nearterm may qualify for alternative closure such qualification would allow ccr disposal units at these plants to continue operating even though they would otherwise be subject to forced closure under the federal ccr regulations epa’s july 29 2020 final regulation adopted this proposal and now requires explicit epa approval for facilities to utilize an alternative closure deadline with respect to the cholla facility aps’s application for alternative closure which would allow the continued disposal of ccr within the facility’s existing unlined ccr surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coalfired boiler operations in april 2025 was submitted to epa on november 30 2020 and is currently pending this application will be subject to public comment and potentially judicial review on january 11 2022 epa began issuing proposed decisions pursuant to this provision of the federal ccr regulations and we anticipate receiving a proposed decision with respect to the cholla facility in 2022 

we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when the epa will take final action on those matters that are still pending depending on the eventual outcome the costs associated with aps’s management of ccr could materially increase which could affect aps’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 27 million and its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for cholla is approximately 16 million the navajo plant disposed of ccr only in a dry landfill storage area to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant aps’s share of incremental costs was approximately 1 million which has been incurred additionally the ccr rule requires ongoing phased groundwater monitoring 

table of contents 

as of october 2018 aps has completed the statistical analyses for its ccr disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring aps determined that several of its ccr disposal units at cholla and four corners will need to undergo corrective action in addition under the current regulations all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure by april 11 2021 at the latest except for those disposal units subject to alternative closure aps completed the assessments of corrective measures on june 14 2019 however additional investigations and engineering analyses that will support the remedy selection are still underway in addition aps will also solicit input from the public and host public hearings as part of this process based on the work performed to date aps currently estimates that its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at four corners will likely range from 10 million to 15 million which would be incurred over 30 years the analysis needed to perform a similar cost estimate for cholla remains ongoing at this time as aps continues to implement the ccr rule’s corrective action assessment process the current cost estimates may change given uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment process we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to the company however at this time we do not believe the cost estimates for cholla and any potential change to the cost estimate for four corners would have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

effluent limitation guidelines on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines “elg” establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate 

on august 11 2017 epa announced that it would be initiating rulemaking proceedings to potentially revise the september 2015 elgs on september 18 2017 epa finalized a regulation postponing the earliest date on which compliance with the elgs for these wastestreams would be required from november 1 2018 until november 1 2020 at this time aps’s national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” discharge permit for four corners contains a december 31 2023 compliance deadline for achieving “zero discharge” of bottom ash transport waters nonetheless on october 13 2020 epa published a final rule relaxing these “zero discharge” limitations for bottom ash handling water and allowing for approximately 10 of such wastewater to be discharged on a volumetric 30day rolling average basis under limited power plant operating scenarios at this time aps is pursuing a modification to the four corners npdes discharge permit in order to implement the most recent elg rulemaking we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this permit modification proceeding including any public commenting or permit appeal procedures the cholla facility does not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone naaqs at a level of 70 parts per billion “ppb” further on december 23 2020 epa issued a final regulation retaining the current primary naaqs for ozone following a required scientific review process with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nox and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 while epa took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on november 6 2017 the agency’s final action designating nonattainment areas was not issued until april 30 2018 at that time epa designated the geographic areas containing yuma and

phoenix arizona as in nonattainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone naaqs the vast majority of aps’s natural gasfired egus are located in these jurisdictions areas of arizona and the navajo nation where the remainder of aps’s fossilfuel fired egu fleet is located were designated as in attainment we anticipate that revisions to the sips and fips implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard will be in place between 2023 and 2024 at this time because proposed sips and fips implementing the revised ozone naaqss have yet to be released aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting aps 

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who released generated transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible each a “prp” prps may be strictly jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study “rifs” based upon discussions between the ou3 working group parties and epa along with the results of recent technical analyses prepared by the ou3 working group to supplement the rifs for ou3 aps anticipates finalizing the rifs during the first or second quarter of 2022 aps estimates that its cost related to this investigation and study is approximately 3 million aps anticipates incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district “rid” filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area on january 25 2015 adeq sent a letter to aps seeking information concerning the degree to which if any aps’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area aps responded to adeq on may 4 2015 on december 16 2016 two rid environmental and engineering contractors filed an ancillary lawsuit for recovery of costs against aps and the other defendants in the rid litigation that same day another rid service provider filed an additional ancillary cercla lawsuit against certain of the defendants in the main rid litigation but excluded aps and certain other parties as named defendants because the ancillary lawsuits concern past costs allegedly incurred by these rid vendors which were ruled unrecoverable directly by rid in november of 2016 the additional lawsuits do not increase aps’s exposure or risk related to these matters 

on april 5 2018 rid and the defendants in that particular litigation executed a settlement agreement fully resolving rid’s cercla claims concerning both past and future cost recovery aps’s share of this settlement was immaterial in addition the two environmental and engineering vendors voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against aps and the other named defendants without prejudice an order to this effect was entered on april 17 2018 with this disposition of the case the vendors may file their lawsuit again in the future on august 16 2019 maricopa county one of the three direct defendants

four corners national pollutant discharge elimination system permit 

on july 16 2018 several environmental groups filed a petition for review before the epa environmental appeals board “eab” concerning the npdes wastewater discharge permit for four corners which was reissued on june 12 2018 the environmental groups allege that the permit was reissued in contravention of several requirements under the clean water act and did not contain required provisions concerning epa’s 2015 revised elgs for steamelectric egus 2014 existingsource regulations governing coolingwater intake structures and effluent limits for surface seepage and subsurface discharges from coalash disposal facilities to address certain of these issues through a reconsidered permit epa took action on december 19 2018 to withdraw the npdes permit reissued in june 2018 withdrawal of the permit moots the eab appeal and epa filed a motion to dismiss on that basis the eab thereafter dismissed the environmental group appeal on february 12 2019 epa then issued a revised final npdes permit for four corners on september 30 2019 based upon a november 1 2019 filing by several environmental groups the eab again took up review of the four corners npdes permit oral argument on this appeal was held on september 3 2020 and the eab denied the environmental group petition on september 30 2020 on january 22 2021 the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the eab’s decision with the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit as of november 11 2021 the parties to this lawsuit including aps reached a tentative agreement to settle this matter review of this agreement including public commenting is currently pending with the epa notwithstanding this tentative agreement we cannot predict the outcome of these appeal proceedings including further settlement discussions and if settlement efforts fail and the appeal is eventually successful whether that outcome will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its operating needs the four corners region in which four corners is located has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area although the watershed and reservoirs are in a good condition at this time aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons including a number of gasfired power plants located within maricopa and pinal counties in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

at this time the lower court proceedings in the gila river adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the gila river should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction a hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in march 2018 in front of a special master and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on may 17 2018 the decision of the special master which was finalized on november 14 2018 but which is subject to further review by the trial court judge accepts the proposed hydrogeologic testing protocols supported by aps and other industrial users of groundwater a final decision by the trial court judge in this matter remains pending further proceedings have been initiated to determine the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations the determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings may ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties such as aps that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations aps cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

little colorado river adjudication aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such 

table of contents 

rights no trial or pretrial proceedings have been scheduled for adjudication of aps’s water right claims the adjudication court is currently conducting a trial of federal reserved water right claims asserted by the hopi tribe and by the united states as trustee for the tribe in addition the adjudication court has established a schedule for consideration of separate federal reserved water right claims asserted by the navajo nation and by the united states as trustee for the nation there is no established timeframe within which the adjudication court is expected to issue a final determination of water rights for the hopi tribe and the navajo nation and any such final determination is likely to occur multiple years in the future

 item 1a risk factors   

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

regulatory risks 

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings adjustor recovery and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances additionally given that aps is subject to oversight by several regulatory agencies a resolution by one may not foreclose potential actions by others for similar or related matters such as the resolution of an arizona attorney general matter see note 11 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of equity and debt securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates including 

table of contents 

the infusion of equity into aps decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid negative operational and financial impacts depends in part upon compliance with federal state and local laws judicial decisions statutes regulations and acc requirements which may be revised from time to time by legislative or other action and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties approximately 12 million per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects 

changes in laws or regulations that govern aps new interpretations of law and regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the manner in which we operate our business and our results of operations in particular new or revised laws or interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impact or call into question the acc’s permissive regulatory authority which may result in uncertainty as to jurisdictional authority within our state and uncertainty as to whether acc decisions will be binding or challenged by other agencies or bodies asserting jurisdiction in november 2021 the arizona court of appeals issued an opinion that called into question the accapproved limitation of liability provision found in the aps service schedules while aps is currently seeking review of the decision at the arizona supreme court the court of appeals decision—if undisturbed—could have an adverse impact on aps’s future potential litigation exposure we are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from any pending or future regulatory or legislative rulemaking 

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities including palo verde in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions of conventional pollutants and ghgs water quality discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital 

table of contents 

operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

coal ash in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units modification or changes to the manner of closure of such units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal in addition the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from ccr disposal units or the presence of ccr constituents within groundwater near ccr disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds 

ozone national ambient air quality standards in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the naaqs for ozone which set new more stringent standards on emissions of nitrogen oxide a precursor to ozone in an effort to protect human health and human welfare depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas 

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices or other clean energy rules or initiatives the economics or feasibility of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

aps faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

table of contents 

potential financial risks — greenhouse gas regulation the clean power plan and potential litigation in 2015 epa finalized a rule to limit co 2 emissions from existing power plants the cpp the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates would have resulted in a shift in generation from coal to more natural gas and renewable generation because of a view that the federal clean air act did not permit such an expansive use of administrative authority over utility generation resources in 2019 regulations were issued that repealed the cpp and replaced it with a far narrower set of regulations focused solely on coalfired power plant efficiency improvements on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the ace regulations and remanded them back to epa to develop new regulations governing carbon emissions from existing power plants consistent with the court’s ruling that decision endorsed an expansive view of the federal clean air act consistent with epa’s 2015 cpp and the current administration has expressed its intent to assert such authority through new carbon emission regulations governing existing power plants 

depending on the outcome of future carbon emission rulemakings under the clean air act targeting new and existing power plants the utility industry may become subject to more stringent and expansive regulations to the extent that these regulations focus on generation shifting as a means of compliance with federal emission performance standards the electric utility industry may be forced to incur substantial costs necessary to achieve compliance in addition we anticipate that such regulations will be challenged in federal court prior to their implementation depending on the outcome of such judicial review the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative ghg emission limitations from power plants alternative ghg emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant ghg emissions 

physical and operational risks weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest united states’ desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent a greater challenge as part of conducting its business aps recognizes that the southwestern united states is particularly susceptible to the risks posed by climate change which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the area where aps conducts its business 

coowners of our jointly owned generation facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation regulations economic conditions or changes in our industry which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities 

aps owns certain of its power plants jointly with other owners with varying ownership interests in such facilities changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources fuel costs legislation and regulation together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities could result in unaligned positions among coowners differences in the coowners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets see note 4 for a discussion of the navajo plant and cholla retirement and the related risks associated with aps’s continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant 

table of contents 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers this is in large part due to a 2004 arizona court of appeals decision that found critical components of the acc’s rules to be violative of the arizona constitution the ruling also voided the operating authority of all the competitive providers previously authorized by the acc on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter 

in november 2018 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona on july 1 and july 2 2019 acc staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules on february 10 2020 two acc commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules on february 12 2020 acc staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules during a july 15 2020 acc staff meeting the acc commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program but no action was taken the acc continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition including the potential for additional buythrough programs or other pilot programs at the same time the arizona legislature is considering a bill that would nullify if approved a 20yearold electric deregulation law that has been in place since 1998 the bill has several procedural steps in the legislative process before becoming law 

changes in tax legislation or regulation may affect our financial results  

we are subject to taxation by various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels legislation or regulations could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities which could affect the company’s tax positions the prospects for federal tax reform have increased due to the results of the 2020 federal elections any such reform may impact the company’s effective tax rate cash taxes paid and other financial results such as earnings per share gross revenues and cash flows we cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which absent appropriate regulatory treatment could have a negative impact on our financial results 

operational risks 

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 

apart from the impact upon electricity demand weather conditions related to prolonged high temperatures or extreme heat events present operational challenges in the southwestern united states where aps conducts its business the effects of climate change are projected to increase the overall average temperature lead to more extreme temperature events and exacerbate prolonged drought conditions leading to the declining availability of water resources extreme heat events and rising temperatures are projected to reduce the generation capacity of thermalpower plants and decrease the efficiency of the transmission grid these operational risks related to rising temperatures and extreme heat events could affect aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition the decrease in snowpack can also lead to reduced water supplies in the areas where aps relies upon nonrenewable water resources to supply cooling and process water for electricity generation prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect aps’s longterm ability to access the water resources necessary for thermal electricity generation operations reductions in the availability of water for power plant cooling could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy resources   the acc enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandated a 22 cumulative annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost revenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the lfcr is designed to address these matters 

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs 

in addition to these rules and requirements energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 22 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period for the three years through 2021 aps’s customer growth averaged 22 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15 to 25 for 2022 and the average annual growth will be in the range of 15 to 25 through 2024 based on anticipated steady population growth in arizona during that period 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period increased 42 which reflects a correction to 2020 commercial and industrial sales volumes of 111 gwh while steady customer growth was offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives the main drivers of positive sales for this period were residential sales being stronger than anticipated due to continued workfromhome policies a strong improvement in sales to commercial 

table of contents 

and industrial customers and the rampup of new data center customers though the total expected impact of covid19 on future sales is currently unknown aps experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales from the outset of the pandemic through april 2021 beginning in may 2021 electric sales to commercial and industrial customers increased to levels in line with precovid sales 

for the three years through 2021 annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 17 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 15 to 25 for 2022 and average annual growth will be in the range of 35 to 45 through 2024 including the effects of customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations this projected sales growth range includes the impacts of new large manufacturing facilities which are expected to contribute to average annual growth in the range of 10 to 20 through 2024 this projected sales growth range also includes our estimated contributions of several large data centers but not all and we will continue to estimate contributions and evaluate sales guidance as these customers develop more usage history these estimates could be further impacted by slower than expected growth of the arizona economy slower than expected rampup of the new data centers larger manufacturing facilities not coming to arizona as expected a shift away from remote work slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation rampup of data centers impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in dg and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a 1 variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 20 million and a 1 variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 5 million 

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others concerns over physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

the impact of wildfires could negatively affect aps’s results of operations 

wildfires have the potential to affect the communities that aps serves and aps’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities the potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather impacts existing in arizona as those that led to the catastrophic wildfires in northern california while we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets wildfire risk is always present due to aps’s expansive service territory aps could be 

table of contents 

held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires if it was determined that they were caused by or enhanced due to aps’s negligence the arizona liability standard is different from that of california which generally imposes liability for resulting damages without regard to fault any damage caused to our assets loss of service to our customers or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the inability to successfully develop acquire or operate generation resources to meet reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our current and future generation portfolio the current regulatory standards laws and regulations create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements including those related to carbon emissions renewables development and energy efficiency measures the development of any generation facility is also subject to many risks including those related to financing siting permitting new and evolving technology and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in expressing concerns about the environmental and climaterelated impacts from continued extraction transportation delivery and combustion of fossil fuels environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting construction and operation of fossil fuel infrastructure projects these efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables including the future course of federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities aps cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop construct and operate fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future 

in january 2020 aps announced its goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity by 2050 with an intermediate 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65 clean energy with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy aps’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of external factors some of which include supportive national and state energy policies a supportive regulatory environment sales and customer growth the development deployment and advancement of clean energy technologies and continued access to capital markets 

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to the operation of aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies climate change is also projected to exacerbate prolonged drought conditions aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information there appears to be an increasing level of activity sophistication and maturity of threat actors in particular nation state actors that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the us bulk power system our information technology systems generation including our palo verde nuclear facility transmission and distribution facilities and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets we have been and could be the target of attacks and the aforementioned systems are critical areas of cyber protection for us 

we rely extensively on it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of these systems are managed hosted provided or used for third parties to assist in conducting our business malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services these vendors provide to us or to use those vendors as a cyber conduit to attack us as more third parties are involved in the operation of our business there is a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy or security of data held by or accessible to third parties may be compromised 

if a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could i experience property damage disruptions to our business theft of or unauthorized access to customer employee financial or system operation information or other information ii experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair remediation and breach notification and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage if such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effects could be compounded or could delay our response or the effectiveness of our response and ability to limit our exposure to potential liability these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change these systems and processes may be insufficient to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance in the safeguarding of our data 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer information and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants the increasing promulgation of nerc and nrc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as those promulgated by nerc and the nrc privacy laws or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties 

the risk of these systemrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and attempted intrusions to our information 

table of contents 

technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems to date we do not believe we have experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations we may not be able to anticipate and prevent all cyberattacks or information security breaches and our ongoing investments in security resources talent and business practices may not be effective against all threat actors as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency we may be unable to prevent all such attacks from being successful in the future 

we maintain cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach coverage for cybersecurity events continues to evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

four corners and portions of certain aps transmission lines are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of aps’s owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 1201 million but not more than 179 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states in addition aps is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under its nuclear property insurance policies with nuclear electric insurance limited “neil” for approximately 224 million if neil’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds and if the retrospective premium assessment is declared by neil’s board of directors although aps has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation including carbonfree nuclear generation and increase the complexity of managing aps’s information technology and power system operations which could adversely affect aps’s business 

customersited alternative energy technologies present challenges to aps’s operations due to misalignment with aps’s existing operational needs when these resources lack “dispatchability” and other elements of utilityside control they are considered “unmanaged” resources the cumulative effect of such unmanaged resources results in added complexity for aps’s system management 

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies including energy storage technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment the implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems which could require additional infrastructure and resources widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s traditional business model 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make aps’s existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

like many companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 30 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2026 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit train and develop new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees additionally any regulatory changes requiring us to enforce a covid19 vaccine mandate could impact the availability of and our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified employees these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

covid19 could negatively affect our business 

covid19 is a continually developing situation around the globe that has led to economic disruption and volatility in the financial markets the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus and mitigate its public health effects including but not limited to a vaccine mandate could decrease demand for energy lower economic growth impact our employees and contractors cause disruptions in our supply chain increase certain costs further increase volatility in the capital markets and result in increases in the cost of capital or an inability to access the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities delay the completion of capital or other construction projects and other operations and 

table of contents 

maintenance activities delay payments or increase uncollectable accounts impact our ability to hire or retain qualified employees or cause other unpredictable events each of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic from march 2020 through april 2021 aps experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales and the cumulative impact on weather normalized retail electricity sales usage was a net increase as compared to 2019 aps also experienced an increase in bad debt expense associated with the covid19 pandemic that resulted in a negative impact to its 2021 operating results in midmarch 2020 we drew on our revolving credit facilities as a result of the commercial paper markets failing to function normally due to covid19 but we were subsequently able to utilize the commercial paper market in april 2020 and we have paid down the revolving credit facilities completely we are also experiencing increased operations and maintenance expenses due to the need for personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs related to covid19 

despite our efforts to manage the impacts the degree to which the covid19 pandemic and related actions ultimately impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows will depend on factors beyond our control including the duration spread and severity of the outbreak the actions taken to contain covid19 and mitigate its public health effects including but not limited to a vaccine mandate the impact on the us and global economies and demand for energy and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume 

financial risks 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would adversely impact our financial results we could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

investment performance changing interest rates new rules or regulations and other economic social and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other special use funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted 

table of contents 

by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we recover most of the pension and other postretirement benefit expense and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner could have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps and its ability to make distributions 

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to its own debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and overthecounter “otc” forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk 

table of contents 

management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthecounter derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

general risks 

proposals to change policy in arizona or other states made through ballot initiatives or referenda may increase the company’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

in arizona and other states a person or organization may file a ballot initiative or referendum with the arizona secretary of state or other applicable state agency and if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are presented the initiative or referendum may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter ballot initiatives and referenda may relate to any matter including policy and regulation related to the electric industry and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact arizona utility customers the arizona economy and the company some ballot initiatives and referenda are drafted in an unclear manner and their potential industry and economic impact can be subject to varied and conflicting interpretations we may oppose certain initiatives or referenda including those that could result in negative impacts to our customers the state or the company via the electoral process litigation traditional legislative mechanisms agency rulemaking or otherwise which could result in significant costs to the company the passage of certain initiatives or referenda could result in laws and regulations that impact our business plans and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

• variations in our quarterly operating results 

• operating results that vary from the expectations of management securities analysts and investors 

• changes in expectations as to future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

• developments generally affecting industries in which we operate 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures or capital commitments 

• announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us 

• favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments 

table of contents 

• our dividend policy 

• future sales by the company of equity or equitylinked securities and 

• general domestic and international economic conditions 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or revisions to rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations changes to the internal policies of our lenders periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

changes in economic conditions monetary policy fiscal policy financial regulation rating agency treatment or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus increase the cost andor reduce the amount of funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

• causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

• increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce funds available to us for operations future investment in our business or other purposes 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

• restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination” transactions with an “interested shareholder” generally any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates who beneficially owned 10 or more of our outstanding voting power at any time during the prior three years or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met 

table of contents 

• antigreenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5 of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied 

• the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of and fill vacancies on the board of directors whether resulting from such increase or from death resignation disqualification or otherwise 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and with respect to preferred stock the other terms including preferences and voting rights of those shares without shareholder approval 

• restrictions that limit the rights of our shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders and 

• restrictions regarding the rights of our shareholders to nominate directors or to submit proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings 

while these provisions may have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

overview 

business overview 

pinnacle west is an investorowned electric utility holding company based in phoenix arizona with consolidated assets of about 22 billion for over 130 years pinnacle west and our affiliates have provided energy and energyrelated products to people and businesses throughout arizona 

pinnacle west derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary aps aps is arizona’s largest and longestserving electric company that generates safe affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 13 million retail customers in 11 of arizona’s 15 counties aps is also the operator and coowner of palo verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwest united states and the largest nuclear power plant in the united states 

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to be an evolving situation the company is operating under longstanding pandemic and business continuity plans that exist to address situations including pandemics like covid19 we are focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees contractors and the general public by helping limit the spread of this virus and ensuring continued safe and reliable electric service for aps customers 

we identified businesscritical positions in our operations and support organizations with backup personnel ready to assist if an issue arose additionally efforts to ensure the health and safety of our employees resulted in bifurcated control rooms thus reducing the number of employees in missioncritical locations we also established covid19 safety protocols social distancing practices and offering virtual options whenever possible the company also took rapid action to implement an all company covid19 hotline a focused covid19 team and procured onsite covid19 testing at key facilities early in the pandemic through this testing case management and contact tracing the company has been able to significantly limit covid19 transmission in the workplace as a result of these efforts we were able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide to our customers while also managing the spread of the virus and promoting the health physical and mental wellbeing and safety of our employees customers and communities in the summer of 2021 the company began transitioning employees that were previously working remotely back to the workplace on a limited basis and began the reduction of our covid19 safety protocols and restrictions due to the covid19 variants and increased transmission 

table of contents 

rates the company has delayed its full transition back to the workplace and covid19 safety protocols and restrictions remain in place 

essential planned work and capital investments are continuing during the pandemic with priority given to support fire mitigation and summer storm efforts as well as heat related outages raw material shortages rising inflation covid19 related work force disruptions and natural disasters are putting increased pressure on the global supply chain aps is experiencing some delays in finished materials and tight labor markets to date aps has not experienced labor or material supply chain shortages that have significantly impacted its ability to serve its customers’ needs however shortages are causing minor delays and shifting of work projects based on material availability if aps continues to experience delays in materials it could experience an increase in purchased power costs for summer generation needs such increased purchased power costs would be expected to be recoverable through the psa see note 4 for additional information on the psa aps has measures in place to continually monitor and evaluate resource needs and supply chain adequacy but cannot predict whether there will be material supply chain shortages in the future 

the company’s operations and maintenance expenses exclusive of bad debt expense increased by approximately 43 million for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to costs for personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs related to covid19 we do not expect the company’s operation and maintenance expenses to be materially impacted in 2022 by costs related to covid19 

while the total expected impact of covid19 on future sales is currently unknown aps experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales from the outset of the pandemic through april 2021 beginning in may 2021 electric sales from commercial and industrial customers increased to levels in line with precovid19 sales but residential sales continued to be higher than precovid19 sales based on past experience a 1 variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 20 million and a 1 variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 5 million 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act allows employers to defer payments of the employer share of social security payroll taxes that would have otherwise been owed from march 27 2020 through december 31 2020 we deferred the cash payment of the employer’s portion of social security payroll taxes for the period july 1 2020 through december 31 2020 which was approximately 18 million we paid half of this cash deferral by december 31 2021 and the remainder will be paid by december 31 2022 

on june 30 2020 ferc issued an order granting a waiver request related to the existing afudc rate calculation beginning march 1 2020 through february 28 2021 on february 23 2021 this waiver was extended until september 30 2021 on september 21 2021 it was further extended until march 31 2022 the order provides a simplified approach that companies may elect to implement in order to minimize the significant distorted effect on the afudc formula resulting from increased shortterm debt financing during the covid19 pandemic aps has adopted this simplified approach to computing the afudc composite rate by using a simple average of the actual historical shortterm debt balances for 2019 instead of current period shortterm debt balances and has left all other aspects of the afudc formula composite rate calculation unchanged this change impacts the afudc composite rate in both 2020 and 2021 but does not impact prior years furthermore the change in the composite rate calculation

strategic overview 

our strategy is to deliver shareholder value by creating a sustainable energy future for arizona by serving our customers with clean reliable and affordable energy 

clean energy commitment 

we are committed to doing our part to make the future clean and carbonfree as arizona stewards we do what is right for the people and prosperity of arizona our vision is to create a sustainable energy future for arizona through providing clean affordable and reliable energy we can accomplish our visions through collaboration with customers communities employees policymakers shareholders and other stakeholders our clean energy goal is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for aps’s customers 

aps’s clean energy goals consist of three parts 

• a 2050 goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity 

• a 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65 clean energy with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy and 

table of contents 

• a commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 

aps’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of important external factors some of which include a supportive regulatory environment sales and customer growth development of clean energy technologies and continued access to capital markets 

2050 goal 100 clean carbonfree electricity achieving a fully clean carbonfree energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration the 2050 goal will involve new thinking and depends on improved and new technologies 

2030 goal 65 clean energy aps has an energy mix that is already 50 clean with existing plans to add more renewables and energy storage before 2025 by building on those plans aps intends to attain an energy mix that is 65 clean by 2030 with 45 of aps’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy “ clean ” is measured as percent of energy mix which includes all carbonfree resources like nuclear and demandside management and “ renewable ” is expressed as a percent of retail sales this target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning investment strategy and customer affordability efforts as aps moves toward 100 clean carbonfree energy mix by 2050 

2031 goal end aps’s use of coalfired generation the commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 will require aps to cease use of coalgeneration at four corners aps has permanently retired more than 1000 mw of coalfired electric generating capacity these closures and other measures taken by aps have resulted in a total reduction of carbon emissions of 33 since 2005 in addition aps has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining cholla units by 2025 

aps understands that the transition away from coalfired power plants toward a clean energy future will pose unique economic challenges for the communities around these plants we worked collaboratively with stakeholders and leaders of the navajo nation to consider the impacts of ceasing operation of aps coalfired power plants on the communities surrounding those facilities to propose a comprehensive coal community transition “cct” plan the proposed framework provided substantial financial and economic development support to build new economic opportunities and addresses a transition strategy for plant employees we are committed to continuing our longrunning partnership with the navajo nation in other areas as well including expanding electrification and developing tribal renewable projects our proposed cct plan supported the navajo nation where four corners is located the communities surrounding the cholla power plant and the hopi tribe which is impacted by closure of the navajo plant on november 2 2021 the acc approved an amended 2019 rate case roo that will require i equal payments over a threeyear period that total 10 million to the navajo nation ii a 1 million onetime payment to the hopi tribe within 60 days of the 2019 rate case decision iii a 500000 onetime payment to the navajo county communities within 60 days of the 2019 rate case decision iv up to 125 million for electrification of homes and businesses on the hopi reservation and v up to 125 million for the electrification of homes and businesses on the navajo nation reservation the payments and expenditures are attributable to the future closures of four corners and cholla along with the prior closure of the navajo plant all ordered payments and expenditures would be recoverable through rates see note 4 for a discussion of the cct plan 

in june 2021 aps and the owners of four corners entered into agreements to operate four corners seasonally beginning in fall 2023 subject to the necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership under seasonal operation a single unit will remain online yearround subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages in addition the other unit will be operational throughout the summer season of june through october when 

table of contents 

customer demand is the highest aps believes that operating four corners seasonally will bring environmental benefits and ensure continued service reliability for its customers especially during arizona’s hot summer months as aps transitions to ceasing to use coalfired generation by 2031 by moving to seasonal operations four corners will become a more flexible resource that supports increasing amounts of clean energy helping to compensate for the intermittent output of renewable resources this change also helps ensure reliability of a critical energy source while reducing operations and maintenance costs aps estimates that the shift to seasonal operations will reduce annual carbon emissions at four corners by an estimated 2025 as compared to current conditions 

renewables aps’s irp see note 4 for additional information establishes the path to meeting our clean energy commitment and maintaining reliable electric service for our customers aps intends to strengthen its already diverse energy mix by increasing its investments in carbonfree resources our irp rapidly adds clean energy and storage resources while maintaining reliable and affordable service its nearterm actions are focused on clean energy and positive customer outcomes and includes a competitive solicitations to procure clean energy resources such as solar wind energy storage and dsm resources all of which lead to a cleaner grid and b strategic shortterm wholesale market purchases from a combination of existing merchant natural gas units neighboring utility systems and wholesale market participants that ensure operational reliability 

aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas that supports our commitment to clean energy which is already strengthened by palo verde the nation’s largest carbonfree clean energy resource that provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for aps customers aps’s longerterm clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new facilities procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources this balance will ensure an appropriately diverse portfolio designed to achieve the same operational reliability and customer affordability as aps’s nearterm strategies in addition aps is actively seeking to include future facility purchase options in its ppas that will enable investments with greater financial flexibility 

aps uses competitive “all source” requests for proposal “rfps” to pursue market resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers aps selects projects based on cost and commercial viability taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development under current market conditions aps must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures available projects are guided by irp timelines and quantities and aps maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the rfp process agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid see “business of arizona public service company — energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources — renewable energy standard — renewable energy portfolio” in item 1 for details regarding aps’s renewable energy resources 

in september 2019 aps issued an rfp that requested up to 250 mw of wind resources to be in service as soon as possible but no later than 2022 as a result of this rfp aps executed a 200 mw ppa for a wind resource that went into service in january 2022 in december 2020 aps issued two additional rfps i a battery storage rfp for projects to be located at two az sun sites and ii an all source rfp that solicited resources to meet our clean energy needs and capacity to maintain system reliability and was later amended to include a request for 150 mw of solar resources to be developed on aps property and owned by aps collectively the “december 2020 rfps” as a result of the all source rfp aps executed a ppa in october 2021 for a 238 mw wind resource to be in service by june 2023 and also executed an 

table of contents 

engineering procurement and construction contract in november 2021 for a 150 mw solar resource to be owned by aps and in service in early 2023 aps continues to negotiate contracts for additional resources to be in service in 2024 in connection with the all source rfp once it secures those important resources and closes out the december 2020 rfps aps intends to issue its next all source rfp to address resource needs for 2025 and beyond 

energy storage  aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage energy storage provides capacity improves power quality can be utilized for system regulation and in certain circumstances be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements increase renewable utilization and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid 

in 2018 aps issued an rfp for approximately 106 mw of energy storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon its evaluation of the rfp responses aps decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site these battery storage facilities are expected to be in service during the summer of 2022 on august 2 2021 aps executed a contract for an additional 60 mw of utilityowned energy storage to be located on aps’s az sun sites this contract with a 2023 inservice date will complete the addition of storage on current apsowned utilityscale solar facilities 

additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year ppas for energy storage totaling 150 mw these ppas were subject to acc approval in order to allow for cost recovery through the psa aps received the requested acc approval on january 12 2021 and service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2022 with respect to 100 mw and in 2023 with respect to 50 mw 

as a result of its december 2020 rfps as of february 2022 aps has executed four 20year ppas for resources that include energy storage a two ppas for standalone energy storage resources totaling 300 mw and b two ppas totaling 275 mw solar plus storage resource the ppas are also subject to acc approval to enable cost recovery through the psa aps received the requested acc approval for three out of four of the projects on december 16 2021 the remaining project was filed in february 2022 for acc approval and is pending acc review service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2023 and 2024 

aps currently plans to install more than 900 mw of energy storage by 2025 including the energy storage projects under ppas and az sun retrofits described above the remaining energy storage is expected to be made up of resources solicited through current and future rfps

the following table summarizes the resources in aps’s energy storage portfolio that are in operation and under development as of december 31 2021 agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions 



a this includes 117 mw of aps customerowned batteries and 03 mw of apsowned residential batteries 

palo verde  palo verde the nation’s largest carbonfree clean energy resource will continue to be a foundational part of aps’s resource portfolio the plant currently supplies nearly 70 of our clean energy and provides the foundation for the reliable and affordable service for aps customers palo verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwest united states the plant is a critical asset to the southwest generating more than 32 million mwh annually – enough power for more than 4 million people its continued operation is important to a carbonfree and clean energy future for arizona and the region a s a reliable continuous affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy 

affordable 

we believe it is aps’s responsibility to deliver electric services to customers in the most costeffective manner since january 2018 through november 2021 the average residential bill decreased by 499 or 748 due to net reductions in cost recovery adjustor mechanisms 

building upon existing cost management efforts aps launched a customer affordability initiative in 2019 the initiative was implemented companywide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes and organizational approaches to completing highvalue work and internal efficiencies in 2021 aps continued to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes and deliver sustainable cost savings which resulted in the company identifying approximately 30 million in annual incremental cost saving opportunities in 2022 

participation in the eim continues to be a tool for creating savings for aps’s customers from the realtime voluntary market aps continues to expect that its participation in eim will lower its fuel and purchasedpower costs improve situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources aps continues to evaluate opportunities that benefit our customers and is exploring opportunities to move to a dayahead market with the expectation of reliably achieving incrementally greater cost savings and using the region’s increasing renewable resources more efficiently as part of that effort aps is exploring several options aps is in discussions with the current eim operator the caiso the western resource adequacy program the western markets exploratory group and the southwest power pool each of these explorations also involve other entities and are being undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and costbenefit of creating a voluntary dayahead market

reliable 

while our energy mix evolves the obligation to deliver reliable service to our customers remains notwithstanding the challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic as well the phoenix metropolitan experiencing the warmest june on record and its summer monsoon being the third wettest over the last 41 years aps continued to provide reliable service to its customers in 2021 

planned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid updating technology accommodating customer growth and enabling more renewable energy resources our advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid the system also integrates a new meter data management system that increases grid visibility and gives customers access to more of their energy usage data 

wildfire safety remains a critical focus for aps and other utilities we increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities these programs contribute to customer reliability responsible forest management and safe communities 

the new units at our modernized ocotillo power plant provide cleanerrunning and more efficient units they support reliability by responding quickly to the variability of solar generation and delivering energy in the late afternoon and early evening when solar production declines as the sun sets and customer demand peaks 

in april 2021 the caiso sought ferc authorization for certain tariff changes intended to try to address risks associated with high heat weather events although aps is generally supportive of some of these changes others would change the load export and wheeling priorities in a way that would unfairly benefit california entities at the expense of noncalifornia entities on june 25 2021 ferc issued an order accepting the caiso’s proposed changes on july 26 2021 aps filed seeking a rehearing of ferc’s june 25 2021 order on august 26 2021 ferc issued a notice indicating that the pending requests for rehearing were denied by operation of law and providing for further consideration the requests for rehearing will be addressed in a future ferc order aps cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

aps’s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource planning sufficient reserve margins customer partnerships to manage peak demand fire mitigation and operational preparedness seasonal readiness procedures at aps also include walkdowns to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys aps also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating on fire and emergency management with federal state and local agencies 

customerfocused 

recognizing that creating customer value is inextricably linked to increasing shareholder value aps’s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves accordingly it is aps’s goal to achieve an industryleading bestinclass customer experience this multiyear objective includes incrementally improving the company’s jd power “jdp” overall customer satisfaction ratings from the fourth quartile to the first quartile of its peer set comprised of large investorowned utilities aps’s rating improved in 2021 with its fourthquarter jdp residential overall customer satisfaction score ranked in the 

table of contents 

third quartile aps made yearoveryear improvements in power quality and reliability billing and payment and phone customer care 

in mid2021 aps initiated an organizationwide customer experience strategy council designed to further drive a customeroriented culture and improve jdp company performance through this and other ongoing customercentric initiatives aps has embraced increased empathy training for care center associates and adopted more flexible payment arrangements for customers numerous customer webbased enhancements also were implemented including streamlined navigation and spanish language transaction capabilities on apscom an enhanced online power outage center and enrollment of more than 1 million customers for outage email and text notifications furthermore aps launched a broadreaching ad campaign focused on energy efficiency and financial assistance programs 

aps offers discounts to qualified limitedincome customers as well as programs to help customers stay current on their bills qualified customers experiencing an unplanned major expense or an unexpected reduction in income can receive up to 800 a year to cover current or past due aps bills through the crisis bill assistance program aps’s energy support program gives qualified limitedincome customers a 25 discount on their bill each month as of december 31 2021 customers received almost 23 million in bill assistance from various sources with the largest amount coming from the arizona department of economic security’s emergency rental assistance program this combined funding will aid approximately 36000 aps customers 

a customer advisory board and a consumer working group were formed in 2020 one made up of a crosssection of customers and the other of stakeholders and advocates representing various customer interests met several times in 2021 to keep aps apprised of customer needs wants and perspectives their direct feedback helped facilitate improved analysis education and communication to customers about their rate plan options rate names and related communications as of december 1 2021 about 54 of aps customers are on their most economical plan the advisory board also helped inform an ongoing redesign and enhancements to aps’s monthly bill based on additional customer feedback research and industry best practices 

developing clean energy technologies 

electric vehicles 

aps is making electric vehicle charging more accessible for its customers and helping arizona businesses schools and governments electrify their fleets in 2021 aps continued its expansion of its take charge az pilot program as of january 2022 aps had installed approximately 400 charging ports at business customer locations with more stations expected to be added through 2022 the program provides charging equipment installation and maintenance to business customers government agencies and multifamily housing communities in addition to the level 2 charging stations aps has begun construction of dc fast charging stations that will be owned and operated by aps at five locations in arizona this project is projected to be completed during 2022 with each location including 2150 kilowatt and 2350 kilowatt dc fast charging stations charging at these stations will be accessible through the electrify america charging network aps also has a goal of 450000 lightduty electric vehicles in its service territory by 2030 

additionally as part of the 2020 dsm plan the acc approved programs for electric vehicles including a residential program to measure electric vehicle charging as well as a 100 rebate to home builders for new home 240v charging station garage outlets 

table of contents 

the acc ordered the state’s public service corporations including aps to develop a longterm comprehensive statewide transportation electrification plan “te plan” for arizona the te plan is intended to provide a roadmap for transportation electrification in arizona focused on realizing the associated air quality and economic development benefits for all residents in the state along with understanding the impact of electric vehicle charging on the grid aps actively participated in developing this plan the acc approved the plan in december 2021 aps is currently working with stakeholders to develop a budget and implementation plan for acc review 

hydrogen production 

palo verde in partnership with idaho national laboratory “inl” energy harbor corporation “energy harbor” and xcel energy incorporated “xcel” was chosen by the doe’s office of nuclear energy to participate in a series of hydrogen production projects with the goal to improve the longterm economic competitiveness of the nuclear power industry the multiphase projects began in 2020 with a series of smallscale hydrogen production demonstration projects led by energy harbor and xcel as well as a technical and economic assessment performed by inl of using electricity generated at palo verde to produce hydrogen 

based on the experience from palo verde’s utility partners’ small scale demonstration projects and from the palo verdespecific technical and economic assessment performed by inl in april 2021 pnw hydrogen llc “pnw hydrogen” a newly formed subsidiary of pinnacle west applied for doe funding for a larger scale hydrogen production demonstration project using electricity sourced from palo verde on october 7 2021 pnw hydrogen was notified that doe’s office of energy efficiency  renewable energy and office of nuclear energy had selected pnw hydrogen’s application for an award of 20 million in federal funding to support the hydrogen production demonstration project subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive cooperative agreement funding instrument between pnw hydrogen and doe 

carbon capture 

carbon capture technologies can isolate co 2 and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products currently almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen carbon capture technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise they are still being tested in realworld conditions these technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired aps will continue to monitor this emerging technology 

environmental social and governance  “ esg ”  practices 

pinnacle west has been integrating esg practices into its core work for almost 30 years as a business strategy we seek solutions that provide “shared value” meaning solutions that address societal and environmental challenges in a way that also delivers business value our commitment extends beyond implementing sustainability practices we are dedicated to working with our stakeholders to identify and address the sustainability issues that we are uniquely positioned to impact through our business in 2020 in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on esg within our organization we increased our efforts by dedicating a new sustainability department at pinnacle west to integrating esg best practices into the everyday work of the company 

table of contents 

as a first step the company engaged the electric power research institute “epri” and leveraged input from employees large customers limitedincome advocates economic development groups environmental nongovernmental organizations leading sustainability academics and other stakeholders to identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most in total 23 priority sustainability issues “psis” were identified and prioritized the most critical category integral shared value includes four issues deemed most important and most able to be impacted by our actions clean energy customer experience energy access and reliability and safety and health these integral psis provide the foundation for informing our strategic direction creating a framework for incorporating best practices and driving enterprisewide alignment and accountability in 2021 the company engaged epri for the second phase of this work focused on benchmarking best practices within these four integral shared value psis we will utilize the benchmarking information to identify opportunities for further improvement in our esg performance 

in 2021 the company established a social issues committee framework the goal of the framework is to provide a process for considering emergent social issues and for determining whether or how best to engage the committee’s responsibility is to determine using a set of principles grounded in the aps promise and the psis whether engagement on specific emergent social issues is appropriate and if so how best to engage 

in 2021 the company finalized an esg strategic framework to guide our work the framework is based upon three foundational pillars esg policy advocacy we advocate for policy that supports our clean energy goals driving performance improving our esg performance in the most important areas including our psis and effectively communicating and amplifying our esg story to our various stakeholders including investors customers employees and beyond the framework will guide and shape our esg work moving forward

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2019 through 2021 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 94 of our total operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue

transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 22 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period for the three years through 2021 aps’s customer growth averaged 22 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15 to 25 for 2022 and the average annual growth will be in the range of 15 to 25 through 2024 based on anticipated steady population growth in arizona during that period 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period increased 42 which reflects a correction to 2020 commercial and industrial customer sales volumes of 111 gwh “2020 sales volume correction” the 2020 sales volume correction impacted prior disclosure in our quarterly reports on form 10q the retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations for the threemonth period ended march 31 2021 the sixmonth period ended june 30 2021 and the ninemonth period ended sept 30 2021 with the 2020 sales volume correction reflected would have been 02 31 and 35 respectively while steady customer growth was offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives the main drivers of positive sales for this period were residential sales being stronger than anticipated due to continued workfromhome policies a strong improvement in sales to commercial and industrial customers and the rampup of new data center customers though the total expected impact of covid19 on future sales is currently unknown aps experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales from the outset of the pandemic through april 2021 beginning in may 2021 electric sales to commercial and industrial customers increased to levels in line with precovid sales 

for the three years through 2021 annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 17 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 15 to 25 for 2022 and average annual growth will be in the range of 35 to 45 through 2024 including the effects of customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations this projected sales growth range includes the impacts of new large manufacturing facilities which are expected to contribute to average annual growth in the range of 10 to 20 through 2024 this projected sales growth range also includes our estimated contributions of several large data centers but not all and we will continue to estimate contributions and evaluate sales guidance as these customers develop more usage history these estimates could be further impacted by slower than expected growth of the arizona economy slower than expected rampup of the new data centers larger manufacturing facilities not coming to arizona as expected a shift away from remote work slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives 

consistent with our focus on continuously looking for improvement in our processes and procedures we updated our weather normalization methodology in 2020 to better leverage available ami data smart meter data while the prior method only used one to two months of daily usage data to estimate weather impacts the new method utilizes a rolling fouryear period of daily usage data which improves the accuracy of estimated weather impacts on energy sales since many more data points are used for each calculation the impact to our 20192021 average normalized sales growth from this change in methodology is 01 

table of contents 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation rampup of data centers impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in dg and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a 1 variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 20 million and a 1 variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 5 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 25 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 15 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation unplanned outages planned outages typically scheduled in the spring and fall renewable energy and dsm related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “liquidity and capital resources” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities 

  

pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net    pension and other postretirement nonservice credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costscredit the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 107 of the assessed value for 2021 108 for 2020 and 109 for 2019 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units and transmission and distribution facilities 

  

table of contents 

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted and was generally effective on january 1 2018 changes impacting the company include a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utilities and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized see note 5 for details of the impacts on the company as of december 31 2021 in aps’s 2017 rate case decision the acc approved the team which was being used to pass through the income tax effects to retail customers of the tax act as part of the 2019 rate case defined above all impacts of the tax act were removed from the team and incorporated into apss base rates the team was retained to address potential changes in tax law that may be enacted prior to a decision in aps’s next rate case see note 4 for details of the team 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 7 for further details the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s only reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily sales supplied under traditional costbased rate regulation and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

operating results – 2021 compared with 2020 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2021 was 619 million compared with 551 million for the prior year the results reflect an increase of approximately 69 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to higher revenue driven by higher customer usage and growth lower refunds in the current year related to the tax act higher transmission revenues the onetime charge in 2020 related to the arizona attorney general matter higher pension and other postretirement nonservice credits and lower other expenses partially offset by the effects of weather higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher income taxes including lower amortization of excess deferred taxes

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses  regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 56 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prior year the following table summarizes the major components of this change 



table of contents 

operations and maintenance  operations and maintenance expenses decreased 2 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period primarily because of 

• a decrease of 21 million primarily related to the covid customer support fund see note 4 personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs for covid19 response 

• a decrease of 13 million for costs related to transmission and distribution 

• an increase of 16 million primarily related to costs for renewable energy and similar regulatory programs which are partially offset in operating revenues and purchased power 

• an increase of 12 million related to employee benefits and 

• an increase of 4 million for corporate resources and other miscellaneous factors 

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expenses were 37 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period primarily due to increased plant in service of 31 million and the regulatory deferrals for the ocotillo modernization project and the four corners scr project of 6 million 

taxes other than income taxes   taxes other than income taxes were 10 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period primarily due to higher property values 

pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net were 57 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to actual market returns exceeding estimated returns in 2020 

all other income and expenses net all other income and expenses net were 35 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the prior year cct and aps foundation contributions 

interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction were 4 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to higher debt balances in the current period partially offset by higher allowance for borrowed funds due to increased capital expenditures 

income taxes   income taxes were 32 million higher for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the prioryear period primarily due to higher pretax net income and lower amortization of excess deferred taxes partially offset by a net operating loss carryback benefit that the company recognized during the first quarter of 2021

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2021 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 51 its total shareholder equity was approximately 66 billion and total capitalization was approximately 131 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 52 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financings and equity infusions from pinnacle west

retirement plans and other postretirement benefits pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries pinnacle west also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans for the employees of pinnacle west and its subsidiaries the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under erisa regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension benefit obligations under erisa the qualified pension plan was estimated to be 138 funded as of january 1 2022 and was 131 as of january 1 2021 future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions we made contributions to our pension plan totaling 100 million in 2021 100 million in 2020 and 150 million in 2019 the minimum required contributions for the pension plan are zero for the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary contributions in 2022 2023 or 2024 regarding contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan we did not make any contributions in 2021 or 2020 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2022 2023 or 2024 the company was reimbursed 24 million in 2021 26 million in 2020 and 30 million in 2019 for prior years retiree medical claims from the other postretirement benefit plan trust assets we continually monitor financial market volatility and its impact on our retirement plans and other postretirement benefits but we believe our liability driven investment strategy helps to minimize the impact of market volatility on our plan’s funded status for instance our pension plan’s funded status as measured for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” purposes is still above 107 funded as of december 31 2021 and our postretirement benefit plans have a funded status also as measured for gaap purposes at december 31 2021 in excess of 145 see note 8 for additional details 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act allows employers to defer payments of the employer share of social security payroll taxes that would have otherwise been owed from march 27 2020 through december 31 2020 we deferred the cash payment of the employer’s portion of social security payroll taxes for the period july 1 2020 through december 31 2020 that was approximately 18 million we paid approximately 9 million on december 28 2021 and will pay the second half of this cash deferral by december 31 2022

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2021 the ratio was approximately 56 for pinnacle west and 50 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could “crossdefault” other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings 

on december 17 2020 the acc issued a financing order that subject to specified parameters and procedures increased aps’s longterm debt limit from 59 billion to 75 billion and authorized aps’s shortterm debt authorization equal to the sum of i 7 of aps’s capitalization and ii 500

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets andor a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is 

table of contents 

subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings except for pension benefits which would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential acc or ferc commissionordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities we had 1712 million of regulatory assets and 2795 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2021 see notes 1 and 4 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit assets liabilities and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2021 reported pension assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2021 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 



a each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point

fair value measurements 

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts fund investments held in our other special use funds certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures 

asset retirement obligations 

we recognize an aro for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible longlived assets for which a legal obligation exists the aro liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets aro measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability we use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an aro this approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes the scenarios 

table of contents 

consider settlement of the aro at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected decommissioning dates the fair value of an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the longlived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets in addition we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded aro for these assets in accordance with gaap accounting aps accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets even if there is no legal obligation for removal 

aros as of december 31 2021 are described further in note 12 

other accounting matters 

in july 2021 a new accounting standard asu 202105 was issued that amends lessor’s accounting treatment for certain lease transactions with variable lease payments we adopted the standard on january 1 2022 using a prospective approach the adoption of this standard did not impact our financial statements see note 3 for additional information

energy sources and resource planning 

to serve its customers aps obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements resource planning is an important function necessary to meet arizona’s future energy needs aps’s sources of energy by type used to supply energy to native load customers during 2020 were as follows 

renewables include energy from wind solar geothermal biomass distributed generation and solar power purchase agreements 

the share of aps’s energy supply being derived from clean resources is 50 bce also has acquired minority ownership positions in two wind farms that achieved commercial operation in 2020 both wind farms deliver power under longterm power purchase agreements see “business of other subsidiaries — bright canyon energy” below for information regarding bce’s investment 

clean energy focus initiatives 

aps has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce carbon including renewable energy procurement and development and promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources” below for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biogas and biomass in addition in january 2020 aps announced its clean energy commitment a threepronged approach aimed at ultimately eliminating carbonemitting resources from its electric generation resource portfolio 

table of contents 

aps’s clean energy goals consist of three parts 

• a 2050 goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity 

• a 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65 clean energy with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy and 

• a commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 

among other strategies aps intends to achieve these goals through various methods such as relying on palo verde the nation’s largest producer of carbonfree energy increasing clean energy resources including renewables developing energy storage ceasing the use of coalgenerated electricity managing demand with a modern interactive grid promoting customer technology and energy efficiency and optimizing regional resources see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” for additional information about aps’s clean energy commitment 

over this same period of time aps also intends to harden its infrastructure in order to improve climate resiliency which involves system and operational improvements aimed at reducing the impact of extreme weather events and other climaterelated disruptions upon aps’s operations among other resiliency strategies aps anticipates increasing investments in a modern and more flexible electricity grid with advanced distribution technologies aps plans to continue its comprehensive forest management programs aimed at reducing wildfires as those risks become compounded by shorter drier winters and longer hotter summers 

aps prepares an annual inventory of ghg emissions from its operations for aps’s operations involving fossilfuel electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution aps’s annual ghg inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program aps also voluntarily tracks the full scope of aps’s ghg emissions arising from all aps operations in addition to ghg emissions from generation and transmission and distribution operations this data includes all other ghg emissions arising from ancillary aps operations such as vehicle use employee travel portable generators and facility energy usage this data is then communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcomcorporateresponsibility  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report 

generation facilities 

  

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2 

  

nuclear 

palo verde generating station — palo verde is a 3unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and approximately 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases approximately 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

  

table of contents 

palo verde leases — in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities the leaseback was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 and contained options to renew the leases or to purchase the leased property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms on july 7 2014 aps exercised the fixed rate lease renewal options the exercise of the renewal options resulted in aps retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases at the end of the lease renewal periods aps will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value extend the leases for up to two years or return the assets to the lessors see note 18 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle — the participant owners of palo verde are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

• mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

• conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

• enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

• fabrication of fuel assemblies 

• utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

• storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2027 and 70 through 2028 100 of palo verde’s requirements for conversion services through 2030 100 of palo verde’s requirements for enrichment services through 2026 and 40 for 2027 and 100 of palo verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several legal proceedings followed challenging doe’s withdrawal of its yucca mountain construction authorization application and the nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application which were consolidated into one matter at the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” following the dc circuit’s august 2013 order the nrc issued two volumes of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application publication of these volumes do not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository aps is directly involved in legal proceedings related to the

doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the palo verde participants filed a lawsuit against the doe in the united states court of federal claims “court of federal claims” for damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe in the court of federal claims this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract for failing to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the standard contract and the nwpa on august 18 2014 aps and the doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment by the doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 in addition the settlement agreement provides aps with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through december 31 2016 which was extended to december 31 2022 

aps has submitted and received payment for six claims pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement for six separate time periods during july 1 2011 through june 30 2019 the doe has paid 997 million for these claims aps’s share is 29 million the amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income aps’s next claim pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement was submitted to the doe on november 2 2020 in the amount of 122 million aps’s share is 36 million 

waste confidence and continued storage — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with national environmental policy act in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel renamed as the continued storage rule the nrc’s decision adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses the final continued storage rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals in june 2016 the dc circuit issued its final decision rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the continued storage rule on august 8 2016 the dc circuit denied a petition for rehearing 

  

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in 

table of contents 

november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility we are on track to meet the current site specific decommissioning costs for palo verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned see note 19 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts 

  

palo verde liability and insurance matters — see “palo verde generating station — nuclear insurance” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

  

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near palo verde ocotillo located in tempe discussed below sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at yucca run on either gas or oil aps has two oilonly power plants fairview located in the town of douglas arizona and yucca gt4 in yuma arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oilonly combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3573 mw a portion of the gas for these plants is financially hedged up to five years in advance of purchasing and that position is converted to a physical gas purchase one month prior to delivery aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2027 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered by truck directly to the power plants 

ocotillo was originally a 330 mw 4unit gas plant located in tempe in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involved retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increased the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw see note 4 for rate recovery as part of the acc final written opinion and order issued reflecting its decision in aps’s general retail rate case the “2017 rate case decision” and the 2019 retail rate case filing the ocotillo modernization project was completed in 2019 

coalfueled generating facilities 

  

four corners — four corners is located in the northwestern corner of new mexico and was originally a 5unit coalfired power plant aps owns 100 of units 1 2 and 3 which were retired as of december 30 2013 aps operates the plant and owns 63 of four corners units 4 and 5 aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 970 mw additionally 4ca a whollyowned subsidiary of pinnacle 

table of contents 

west owned 7 of units 4 and 5 from july 2016 through july 2018 following its acquisition of el paso’s interest in these units described below as part of aps’s clean energy commitment aps has committed to cease using coalfired generation as part of its portfolio of electricity generating resources including four corners by 2031 

ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine that serves four corners and develop other energy projects is the coal supplier for four corners the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 the “2016 coal supply agreement” el paso a 7 owner of units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el paso’s reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

on june 29 2018 4ca and ntec entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the sale to ntec of 4ca’s 7 interest in four corners the sale transaction closed on july 3 2018 ntec purchased the 7 interest at 4ca’s book value approximately 70 million and is paying 4ca the purchase price over a period of four years pursuant to a secured interestbearing promissory note in connection with the sale pinnacle west guaranteed certain obligations that ntec will have to the other owners of four corners such as ntec’s 7 share of capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses pinnacle west’s guarantee is secured by a portion of aps’s payments to be owed to ntec under the 2016 coal supply agreement 

the 2016 coal supply agreement contained alternate pricing terms for the 7 interest in the event ntec did not purchase the interest until the time that ntec purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions were applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms included a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales the amount under this formula for calendar year 2018 up to the date that ntec purchased the 7 interest was approximately 10 million which was due to 4ca on december 31 2019 such payment was satisfied in january 2020 by ntec directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of future coal payment obligations 

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

cholla — cholla was originally a 4unit coalfired power plant which is located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 and aps operated that unit for pacificorp on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at the other apsowned units units 1 and 3 at the plant by the mid2020s if epa approved a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved aps’s plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of aps’s remaining investment in the unit aps closed

unit 2 on october 1 2015 following the closure of unit 2 aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 387 mw in early 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating aps’s compromise proposal which took effect for cholla on april 26 2017 in december 2019 pacificorp notified aps that it planned to retire cholla unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in december 2020 

aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 in addition aps has a coal transportation contract that runs through 2024 

navajo plant — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in units 1 2 and 3 aps had a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant would remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that allowed for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations in november 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 4 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and which may be material 

see note 11 for information regarding aps’s coal mine reclamation obligations related to these coalfired plants 

solar facilities 

aps developed utility scale solar resources through the 170 mw accapproved az sun program investing approximately 675 million in this program these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona in addition to the az sun program aps developed the 40 mw red rock solar plant which it owns and operates two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from aps that are equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that red rock is projected to generate 

  

aps owns and operates more than thirty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar systems in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 was a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona the pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 rate case decision the participants have been transferred to the solar partner program described below additionally aps owns 13 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

table of contents 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing an apsowned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid the first stage of the program called the “solar partner program” placed 8 mw of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as made systems available to limitedincome customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties the second stage of the program which included an additional 2 mw of rooftop solar and energy storage placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 mw on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various gridrelated operation improvements and system interoperability and was in operation by the end of 2016 the costs for this program have been included in aps’s rate base as part of the 2017 rate case decision 

in the 2017 rate case decision the acc also approved the “aps solar communities” program aps solar communities formerly az sun ii is a threeyear program authorizing aps to spend 10 million to 15 million in capital costs each year to install utilityowned distributed generation systems on low to moderate income residential homes nonprofit entities title i schools and rural government facilities the 2017 rate case decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses property taxes marketing and advertising expenses and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the res currently aps has installed 9 mw of distributed generation systems under the aps solar communities program 

energy storage 

aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage storage can provide capacity improve power quality be utilized for system regulation integrate renewable generation and in certain circumstances be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments energy storage can also aid in integrating higher levels of renewables by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale energy storage projects to benefit customers to increase renewable utilization and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid we are preparing for additional energy storage in the future 

in early 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under the agreement was scheduled to begin in 2021 however aps terminated the agreement effective february 16 2021 because the facility will not meet the expected inservice date in 2018 aps issued a request for proposal rfp for approximately 106 mw of energy storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon its evaluation of the rfp responses aps decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site these battery storage facilities are expected to be in service by june 2022 additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year power purchase agreements “ppas” for energy storage totaling 150 mw in april 2019 a battery module in aps’s mcmicken battery energy storage facility experienced an equipment failure which prompted an internal investigation to determine the cause aps has now completed its investigation of the mcmicken battery incident and is working with all counterparties to ensure that the learnings from the investigation and the corresponding safety requirements are incorporated into all battery storage projects going forward including the projects associated with the two abovereferenced ppas these ppas were also subject to acc approval in order to allow for cost recovery through the psa aps received the requested acc approval on january 12 2021 and service under both agreements is expected to begin in 2022 

table of contents 

we currently plan to install at least 850 mw of energy storage by 2025 including the energy storage projects under ppas and az sun retrofits described above the remaining energy storage is expected to be made up of resources solicited through current and future rfps currently aps has two rfps in the market that seek energy storage resources i a battery storage rfp for projects to be located at the remaining two az sun sites that were not included in the 2018 rfp referenced in the preceding paragraph and ii an ‘all source’ rfp that solicits both standalone energy storage and renewable energy plus energy storage resources such resources would be expected to be in service during 2023 and 2024 

purchased power contracts 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 16 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability in addition aps has also entered into several power purchase agreements for energy storage see “business of arizona public service company — energy sources and resource planning — energy storage” above for details of our energy storage power purchase agreements 

purchased power capacity — aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts as of december 31 2020 is summarized in the table below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted 

a up to 45 mw of capacity is available however the amount of electricity available to aps under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually 

b this is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement under which aps receives electricity during the summer peak season from may 15 to september 15 and aps returns a like amount of electricity during the winter season from october 15 to february 15 this agreement expired on february 15 2021 

c the capacity under this agreement is 60 mw in 2021 and 75 mw for years 2022 through 2025 

d renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “current and future resources — renewable energy standard — renewable energy portfolio”

current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2020 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 30 2020 at 7660 mw compared to the 2019 peak of 7115 mw recorded on august 5 2019 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2020 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 19 for 2021 due to expiring purchased power contracts aps is procuring market resources to maintain its minimum 15 planning reserve criteria 

future resources and resource plan 

acc rules require utilities to develop 15year integrated resource plans “irp” which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan timeframe the acc reviews each utility’s irp to determine if it meets the necessary requirements and whether it should be acknowledged in march of 2018 the acc reviewed the 2017 irps of its jurisdictional utilities and voted to not acknowledge any of the plans aps does not believe that this lack of acknowledgment will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows based on an acc decision aps was originally required to file its next irp by april 1 2020 on february 20 2020 the acc extended the deadline for all utilities to file their irps from april 1 2020 to june 26 2020 on june 26 2020 aps filed its final irp on july 15 2020 the acc extended the schedule for final acc review of utility irps to february 2021 the acc has taken no action on aps’s irp

energy modernization plan 

on july 30 2020 the acc staff issued final draft energy rules which proposed 100 of retail kwh sales from clean energy resources by the end of 2050 nuclear is defined as a clean energy resource the proposed rules also require 50 of retail energy served be renewable by the end of 2035 on october 14 2020 the acc passed one amendment to acc staff’s final draft energy rules that will require electric utilities to obtain 35 of peak load as measured in 2020 by 2030 from dsm resources including traditional energy efficiency demand response and other programs aimed at reducing energy usage peak demand management and load shifting this standard aligns with the proposed rules’ threeyear resource planning cycle and allows recovery of costs through existing mechanisms until the acc issues a decision in a future rate proceeding on october 29 2020 the acc approved an amendment that will require electric utilities to reduce their carbon emissions over 20162018 levels by 50 by 2032 75 by 2040 and 100 by 2050 the acc also approved an amendment which will require utilities to install energy storage systems with an aggregate capacity equal to 5 of each utility’s 2020 peak demand by 2035 of which 40 must be derived from customerowned or customerleased distributed storage another approved amendment modifies the resource planning process including requirements for the acc to approve a utility’s load forecast and resource plan and for a utility to perform an allsource request for information to guide its resource plan on november 13 2020 the acc approved a final draft energy rules package and additional procedural steps in the rulemaking process are required to be completed before the rules may take effect aps cannot predict the outcome of this matter see note 4 for additional information related to these energy rules 

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 11 of retail electric sales in 2021 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 

  

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 11 in 2021 on september 23 2020 the acc approved the 2020 res implementation plan on july 1 2020 aps filed its 2021 res implementation plan the following table summarizes the res requirement standard and its timing 



on april 21 2015 the res rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy the rules allow the acc to consider such information in determining whether aps has satisfied the requirements of the res 

table of contents 

renewable energy portfolio to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 2106 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 1956 mw are currently in operation and 150 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 245 mw of facilities owned by aps 626 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 1085 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — solar facilities” above for information regarding apsowned solar facilities 

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development as of december 31 2020 agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid

c includes rooftop solar facilities owned by third parties distributed generation is produced in dc and is converted to ac for reporting purposes 

aps also issued two rfps in september 2019 the first rfp sought competitive proposals for up to 150 mw of apsowned solar resources this solar generation will be designed with the flexibility to add energy storage as a future option negotiations pursuant to this rfp are ongoing with results expected in the first quarter of 2021 and project inservice expected by the end of 2022 a second rfp requested up to 250 mw of wind resources to be in service as soon as possible but no later than 2022 as a result of this rfp aps executed a 200 mw power purchase agreement for a wind resource that is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021 in december 2020 aps issued two additional rfps one to acquire both renewable energy and additional peaking capacity resources and the other to install more battery energy storage at two existing aps solar plants 

demand side management 

on january 1 2011 arizona regulators adopted an ees of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 to increase energy efficiency and other demand side management programs encouraging customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy aps achieved the 22 ees in 2020 see note 4 for information regarding energy efficiency other dsm obligations and the energy modernization plan 

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates see note 4 for information regarding acc’s regulation of aps’s retail electric rates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting 

table of contents 

utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another in february of 2015 

on november 17 2018 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona an acc special open meeting workshop was held on december 3 2018 no substantive action was taken but interested parties were asked to submit written comments and respond to a list of questions from acc staff on july 1 and july 2 2019 acc staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules interested parties filed comments to the acc staff report and a stakeholder meeting and workshop to discuss the retail electric competition rules was held on july 30 2019 acc commissioners submitted additional questions regarding this matter on february 10 2020 two acc commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules on february 12 2020 acc staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules the acc held a workshop on february 2526 2020 on further consideration and discussion of the retail electric competition rules during a july 15 2020 acc staff meeting the acc commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program but no action was taken the acc commissioners are continuing to explore the retail electric competition rules aps cannot predict whether these efforts will result in any changes and if changes to the rules results what impact these rules would have on aps 

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 4 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2020 approximately 44 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and natural gas the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative initiatives there have been no recent successful attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate ghg emissions and it is unclear at this time whether climatechange related legislation originating from the 117th congress will be considered in the senate and then signed into law by president biden in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is written enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona at this time the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review “nsr” analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 19 2019 epa took final action on its proposals to repeal epa’s 2015 clean power plan “cpp” and replace those regulations with a new rule the affordable clean energy “ace” regulations epa originally finalized the cpp on august 3 2015 and such rules would have had far broader impact on the electric power sector than the ace regulations the ace regulations had been stayed pending judicial review and on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the ace regulations and remanded them back to epa to develop new existing power plant carbon regulations consistent with the court’s ruling that ruling endorsed an expansive view of the federal clean air act consistent with epa’s 2015 cpp while the biden administration has expressed an intent to regulate carbon emissions in this sector more aggressively under the clean air act we cannot at this time predict the outcome of pending epa rulemaking proceedings in response to the court’s recent ace decision 

other environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations the ozone national ambient air quality standard and other rules or matters involving the

clean air act clean water act endangered species act resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” superfund the navajo nation and water supplies for our power plants the financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of our coal plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly our coal plants may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules  in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis final regulations imposing bart requirements have now been imposed on each aps coalfired power plant four corners was required to install new pollution controls to comply with bart while similar pollution control installation requirements were not necessary for cholla 

cholla in early 2017 epa approved a final rule containing a revision to arizona’s state implementation plan “sip” for cholla that implemented bart requirements for this facility which did not require the installation of any new pollution control capital improvements in conjunction with the closure of cholla unit 2 in 2015 aps has committed to ceasing coal combustion within units 1 and 3 by april 2025 pacificorp retired cholla unit 4 at the end of 2020 see “cholla” in note 4 for information regarding future plans for cholla and details related to the resulting regulatory asset 

  

four corners  based on epa’s final standards aps’s 63 share of the cost of required bart controls for four corners units 4 and 5 was approximately 400 million which has been incurred see note 4 for information regarding the related rate recovery in addition aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 ntec purchased the interest from 4ca on july 3 2018 see “four corners — 4ca matter” in note 11 for a discussion of the ntec purchase the cost of the pollution controls related to the 7 interest is approximately 45 million which was assumed by ntec through its purchase of the 7 interest 

coal combustion waste on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the rcra and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions these criteria include standards governing location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity such closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below 

table of contents 

since these regulations were finalized epa has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing ccr disposal while certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions others have resulted from judicial review courtapproved settlements with environmental groups and statutory changes to rcra the following lists the pending regulatory changes that if finalized could have a material impact as to how aps manages ccr at its coalfired power plants 

• following the passage of the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act in 2016 epa possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for ccr management or issue federal permits governing ccr disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands although adeq has taken steps to develop a ccr permitting program it is not clear when that program will be put into effect on december 19 2019 epa proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of ccr management permits 

• on march 1 2018 as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups epa proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by ccr disposal activities apart from a subsequent proposal issued on august 14 2019 to add a specific healthbased groundwater protection standard for boron epa has yet to take action on this proposal 

• based on an august 21 2018 dc circuit decision which vacated and remanded those provisions of the epa ccr regulations that allow for the operation of unlined ccr surface impoundments epa recently proposed corresponding changes to federal ccr regulations on july 29 2020 epa took final action on new regulations establishing revised deadlines for initiating the closure of unlined ccr surface impoundments such disposal units must close as soon as technically feasible but no later than april 22 2021 

• on november 4 2019 epa also proposed to change the manner by which facilities that have committed to cease burning coal in the nearterm may qualify for alternative closure such qualification would allow ccr disposal units at these plants to continue operating even though they would otherwise be subject to forced closure under the federal ccr regulations epa’s july 29 2020 final regulation adopted this proposal and now requires explicit epa approval for facilities to utilize an alternative closure deadline with respect to the cholla facility aps’s application for alternative closure which would allow the continued disposal of ccr within the facility’s existing unlined ccr surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coalfired boiler operations in april 2025 was submitted to epa on november 30 2020 and is currently pending this application will be subject to public comment and potentially judicial review 

we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when the epa will take final action on those matters that are still pending depending on the eventual outcome the costs associated with aps’s management of ccr could materially increase which could affect aps’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 27 million and its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for cholla is approximately 16 million the navajo plant disposed of ccr only in a dry landfill storage area to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant aps’s share of incremental costs was approximately 1 million which has been incurred additionally the ccr rule requires ongoing phased groundwater monitoring 

table of contents 

as of october 2018 aps has completed the statistical analyses for its ccr disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring aps determined that several of its ccr disposal units at cholla and four corners will need to undergo corrective action in addition under the current regulations all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure by october 31 2020 aps initiated an assessment of corrective measures on january 14 2019 and expects such assessment will continue through mid to late2021 as part of this assessment aps continues to gather additional groundwater data and perform remedial evaluations as to the ccr disposal units at cholla and four corners undergoing corrective action in addition aps will solicit input from the public host public hearings and select remedies as part of this process based on the work performed to date aps currently estimates that its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at four corners will likely range from 10 million to 15 million which would be incurred over 30 years the analysis needed to perform a similar cost estimate for cholla remains ongoing at this time as aps continues to implement the ccr rule’s corrective action assessment process the current cost estimates may change given uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment process we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to the company however at this time we do not believe the cost estimates for cholla and any potential change to the cost estimate for four corners would have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

effluent limitation guidelines on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines “elg” establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate 

on august 11 2017 epa announced that it would be initiating rulemaking proceedings to potentially revise the september 2015 effluent limitation guidelines on september 18 2017 epa finalized a regulation postponing the earliest date on which compliance with the effluent limitation guidelines for these wastestreams would be required from november 1 2018 until november 1 2020 at this time aps’s national pollution discharge elimination system “npdes” discharge permit for four corners contains a december 31 2023 compliance deadline for achieving “zero discharge” of bottom ash transport waters nonetheless on october 13 2020 epa published a final rule relaxing these “zero discharge” limitations for bottom ash handling water and allowing for approximately 10 of such wastewater to be discharged on a volumetric 30day rolling average basis under limited power plant operating scenarios at this time aps is pursuing a modification to the four corners npdes discharge permit in order to implement the most recent elg rulemaking we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this permit modification proceeding including any public commenting or permit appeal procedures the cholla facility does not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” at a level of 70 parts per billion “ppb” further on december 23 2020 epa issued a final regulation retaining the current primary naaqs for ozone following a required scientific review process with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nox and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 while epa took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on november 6 2017 the agency’s final action 

table of contents 

designating nonattainment areas was not issued until april 30 2018 at that time epa designated the geographic areas containing yuma and phoenix arizona as in nonattainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone naaqs the vast majority of aps’s natural gasfired egus are located in these jurisdictions areas of arizona and the navajo nation where the remainder of aps’s fossilfuel fired egu fleet is located were designated as in attainment we anticipate that revisions to the sips and fips implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard will be in place between 2023 and 2024 at this time because proposed sips and fips implementing the revised ozone naaqss have yet to be released aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting aps 

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who released generated transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible “prps” prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study “rifs” based upon discussions between the ou3 working group parties and epa along with the results of recent technical analyses prepared by the ou3 working group to supplement the rifs for ou3 aps anticipates finalizing the rifs during the first or second quarter of 2021 we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 3 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district “rid” filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area on january 25 2015 adeq sent a letter to aps seeking information concerning the degree to which if any aps’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area aps responded to adeq on may 4 2015 on december 16 2016 two rid environmental and engineering contractors filed an ancillary lawsuit for recovery of costs against aps and the other defendants in the rid litigation that same day another rid service provider filed an additional ancillary cercla lawsuit against certain of the defendants in the main rid litigation but excluded aps and certain other parties as named defendants because the ancillary lawsuits concern past costs allegedly incurred by these rid vendors which were ruled unrecoverable directly by rid in november of 2016 the additional lawsuits do not increase aps’s exposure or risk related to these matters 

on april 5 2018 rid and the defendants in that particular litigation executed a settlement agreement fully resolving rid’s cercla claims concerning both past and future cost recovery aps’s share of this settlement was immaterial in addition the two environmental and engineering vendors voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against aps and the other named defendants without prejudice an order to this effect was entered on april 17 2018 with this disposition of the case the vendors may file

their lawsuit again in the future on august 16 2019 maricopa county one of the three direct defendants in the service provider lawsuit filed a thirdparty complaint seeking contribution for its liability if any from aps and 28 other thirdparty defendants we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters however we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant sites certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

four corners national pollutant discharge elimination system permit 

on july 16 2018 several environmental groups filed a petition for review before the epa environmental appeals board “eab” concerning the npdes wastewater discharge permit for four corners which was reissued on june 12 2018 the environmental groups allege that the permit was reissued in contravention of several requirements under the clean water act and did not contain required provisions concerning epa’s 2015 revised effluent limitation guidelines for steamelectric egus 2014 existingsource regulations governing coolingwater intake structures and effluent limits for surface seepage and subsurface discharges from coalash disposal facilities to address certain of these issues through a reconsidered permit epa took action on december 19 2018 to withdraw the npdes permit reissued in june 2018 withdrawal of the permit moots the eab appeal and epa filed a motion to dismiss on that basis the eab thereafter dismissed the environmental group appeal on february 12 2019 epa then issued a revised final npdes permit for four corners on september 30 2019 based upon a november 1 2019 filing by several environmental groups the eab again took up review of the four corners npdes permit oral argument on this appeal was held on september 3 2020 and the eab denied the environmental group petition on september 30 2020 on january 22 2021 the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the eab’s decision with the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit we cannot predict the outcome of these appeal proceedings and if such appeal is successful whether that outcome will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its operating needs the four corners region in which four corners is located has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area however during the past 12 months the region has received snowfall and precipitation sufficient to recover the navajo reservoir to an optimum operating level reducing the probability of shortage in future years although the watershed and reservoirs are in a good condition at this time aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons including a number of gasfired power plants located within maricopa and pinal counties in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

at this time the lower court proceedings in the gila river adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the gila river should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction a hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in march of 2018 in front of a special master and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on may 17 2018 the decision of the special master which was finalized on november 14 2018 but which is subject to further review by the trial court judge accepts the proposed hydrogeologic testing protocols supported by aps and other industrial users of groundwater a final decision by the trial court judge in this matter remains pending further proceedings have been initiated to determine the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations the determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings may ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties such as aps that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations aps cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings

little colorado river adjudication aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights no trial or pretrial proceedings have been scheduled for adjudication of aps’s water right claims the adjudication court is currently conducting a trial of federal reserved water right claims asserted by the hopi tribe and by the united states as trustee for the tribe in addition the adjudication court has established a schedule for consideration of separate federal reserved water right claims asserted by the navajo nation and by the united states as trustee for the nation there is no established timeframe within which the adjudication court is expected to issue a final determination of water rights for the hopi tribe and the navajo nation and any such final determination is likely to occur multiple years in the future

 item 1a risk factors   

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

regulatory risks 

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings adjustor recovery and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances additionally given that aps is subject to oversight by several regulatory agencies a resolution by one may not foreclose potential actions by others for similar or related matters such as the recent resolution of an arizona attorney general matter see note 11 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of equity and debt securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates including the infusion of equity into aps decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid negative operational and financial impacts depends in part upon compliance with federal state and local statutes regulations and acc requirements which may be revised from time to time by legislative or other action and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties approximately 12 million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects 

changes in laws or regulations that govern aps new interpretations of law and regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the manner in which we operate our business and our results of operations in particular new or revised laws or interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impact or call into question the acc’s permissive regulatory authority 

table of contents 

which may result in uncertainty as to jurisdictional authority within our state and uncertainty as to whether acc decisions will be binding or challenged by other agencies or bodies asserting jurisdiction we are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from any pending or future regulatory or legislative rulemaking 

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities including palo verde in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases water quality discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

coal ash in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal in addition the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from ccr disposal units or the presence of ccr constituents within groundwater near ccr disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds 

ozone national ambient air quality standards in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides which set new more stringent standards intended to 

table of contents 

protect human health and human welfare depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas 

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices or other clean energy rules or initiatives the economics or feasibility of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

aps faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

potential financial risks — greenhouse gas regulation the clean power plan and potential litigation in 2015 epa finalized a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the cpp the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates would have resulted in a shift in generation from coal to more natural gas and renewable generation because of a view that the federal clean air act did not permit such an expansive use of administrative authority over utility generation resources in 2019 regulations were issued that repealed the cpp and replaced it with a far narrower set of regulations focused solely on coalfired power plant efficiency improvements on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the ace regulations and remanded them back to epa to develop new regulations governing carbon emissions from existing power plants consistent with the court’s ruling that decision endorsed an expansive view of the federal clean air act consistent with epa’s 2015 cpp and the current administration has expressed its intent to assert such authority through new carbon emission regulations governing existing power plants 

depending on the outcome of future carbon emission rulemakings under the clean air act targeting new and existing power plants the utility industry may become subject to more stringent and expansive regulations to the extent that these regulations focus on generation shifting as a means of compliance with federal emission performance standards the electric utility industry may be forced to incur substantial costs necessary to achieve compliance in addition we anticipate that such regulations will be challenged in federal court prior to their implementation depending on the outcome of such judicial review the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative ghg emission limitations from power plants alternative ghg emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant ghg emissions 

physical and operational risks weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest united states’ desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system 

table of contents 

large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent a greater challenge as part of conducting its business aps recognizes that the southwestern united states is particularly susceptible to the risks posed by climate change which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the area where aps conducts its business 

coowners of our jointly owned generation facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation regulations economic conditions or changes in our industry which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities 

aps owns certain of our power plants jointly with other owners with varying ownership interests in such facilities changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources fuel costs legislation and regulation together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities could result in unaligned positions among coowners such differences in the coowners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could ultimately lead to disagreements among the parties as to how and whether to continue operation of such plants which could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets see note 4 for a discussion of the navajo plant and cholla retirement and the related risks associated with aps’s continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers this is in large part due to a 2004 arizona court of appeals decision that found critical components of the acc’s rules to be violative of the arizona constitution the ruling also voided the operating authority of all the competitive providers previously authorized by the acc on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

one of these options would be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generationx program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation the agx program was approved by the acc as part of the 2017 settlement agreement as defined in note 4 

in november 2018 the acc voted to again reexamine retail competition in addition proposals to enable or support retail electric competition may be made from time to time through ballot initiatives legislative action or other forums in arizona the acc held a workshop on february 2526 2020 on further consideration and discussion of the retail electric competition rules aps cannot predict whether

these efforts will result in any changes and if changes to the rules results what impact these rules would have on aps 

changes in tax legislation or regulation may affect our financial results  

we are subject to taxation by various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels legislation or regulations could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities which could affect the company’s tax positions the prospects for federal tax reform have increased due to the results of the recent elections any such reform may impact the company’s effective tax rate cash taxes paid and other financial results such as earnings per share gross revenues and cash flows we cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which absent appropriate regulatory treatment could have a negative impact on our financial results 

operational risks 

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

apart from the impact upon electricity demand weather conditions related to prolonged high temperatures or extreme heat events present operational challenges in the southwestern united states where aps conducts its business the effects of climate change are projected to increase the overall average temperature lead to more extreme temperature events and exacerbate prolonged drought conditions leading to the declining availability of water resources extreme heat events and rising temperatures are projected to reduce the generation capacity of thermalpower plants and decrease the efficiency of the transmission grid these operational risks related to rising temperatures and extreme heat events could affect aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition the decrease in snowpack can also lead to reduced water supplies in the areas where aps relies upon nonrenewable water resources to supply cooling and process water for electricity generation prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect aps’s longterm ability to access the water resources necessary for thermal electricity generation operations reductions in the availability of water for power plant cooling could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy resources   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 cumulative annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost revenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the lfcr is designed to address these matters 

table of contents 

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs 

in addition to these rules and requirements energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 23 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the prioryear period for the three years 2018 through 2020 aps’s customer growth averaged 20 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15 to 25 for 2021 and for 2021 through 2023 based on our assessment of steady population growth in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the prioryear period while steady customer growth was offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong residential sales due to workfromhome policies and a gradual improvement in sales to commercial and industrial customers though the total expected impact of covid19 on future sales is currently unknown aps has experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales since the outset of the pandemic from march 13 2020 through december 31 2020 the cumulative impact on weathernormalized usage was approximately a 1 increase during that period aps’s retail electric residential weathernormalized sales increased 5 and its retail electric commercial and industrial weathernormalized sales decreased 4 in the aggregate aps expects the reduction in electric demand from commercial and industrial customers and increased demand from residential customers to normalize somewhat into 2021 as business activity continues to recover and more people return to work 

for the three years 2018 through 2020 annual retail electricity sales were about flat adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 05 to 15 for 2021 and increase on average in the range of 10 to 20 during 2021 through 2023 including the effects of customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations this projected sales growth range now includes our estimated contributions of several large data centers but not all and we will continue to estimate contributions and evaluate sales guidance as these customers develop more usage history these estimates could be further impacted by slower than expected growth of the arizona economy slower than expected rampup of the new data centers or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency distributed renewable generation initiatives 

actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation ramp up of data centers impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if we experience acceleration of expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives we may be unable to reach our estimated sales

projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others concerns over physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

the impact of wildfires could negatively affect aps’s results of operations 

wildfires have the potential to affect the communities that aps serves and aps’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities the potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather impacts existing in arizona as those that led to the catastrophic wildfires in northern california while we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets wildfire risk is always present due to aps’s expansive service territory aps could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires if it was determined that they were caused by or enhanced due to aps’s negligence the arizona liability standard is different from that of california which generally imposes liability for resulting damages without regard to fault any damage caused to our assets loss of service to our customers or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the inability to successfully develop acquire or operate generation resources to meet reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our current and future generation portfolio the current regulatory standards laws and regulations create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements including those related to carbon emissions renewables development and energy efficiency measures the development of any generation facility is also subject to many risks including those related to financing siting permitting new and evolving technology and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in expressing concerns about the environmental and climaterelated impacts from continued extraction transportation delivery and combustion of fossil fuels environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting construction and operation of fossil fuel infrastructure projects these efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables including the future course of federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities aps cannot predict the effect that 

table of contents 

any such opposition may have on our ability to develop construct and operate fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future 

in january 2020 aps announced its goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity by 2050 with an intermediate 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65 clean energy with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy aps’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of external factors some of which include supportive national and state energy policies a supportive regulatory environment sales and customer growth the development deployment and advancement of clean energy technologies and continued access to capital markets 

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies climate change is also projected to exacerbate prolonged drought conditions aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information there appears to be an increasing level of activity sophistication and maturity of threat actors in particular nation state actors that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the us bulk power transmission and distribution system our information technology systems generation including our palo verde nuclear facility transmission and distribution facilities and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of unauthorized access and are critical areas of cyber protection for us 

we rely extensively on it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of these systems are managed hosted provided or used for third parties to assist in conducting our business malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services these vendors provide to us or to use those vendors as a cyber conduit to attack us as more third parties are involved in the operation of our business there is a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy or security of data held by or accessible to third parties may be compromised 

if a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could i experience property damage disruptions to our business theft of or unauthorized access to customer employee financial or system operation information or other information ii experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair remediation and breach notification and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage if such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded or could delay our response or the effectiveness of our response and ability to limit our exposure to potential liability these types of events could also 

table of contents 

require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change these systems and processes may be insufficient to mitigate the possibility of information and cybersecurity incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance in the safeguarding of our data 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants the increasing promulgation of nerc and nrc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as those promulgated by nerc and the nrc privacy laws or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties 

the risk of these systemrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems to date we do not believe we have experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations we may not be able to anticipate and prevent all cyberattacks or information security breaches and our ongoing investments in security resources talent and business practices may not be effective against all threat actors as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency we may be unable to prevent all such attacks from being successful in the future 

we maintain cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach coverage for cybersecurity events continues to evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

four corners and portions of certain aps transmission lines are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

table of contents 

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 1201 million but not more than 179 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power reactor in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation including carbonfree nuclear generation and increase the complexity of managing aps’s information technology and power system operations which could adversely affect aps’s business 

customersited alternative energy technologies present challenges to aps’s operations due to misalignment with aps’s existing operational needs when these resources lack “dispatchability” and other elements of utilityside control they are considered “unmanaged” resources the cumulative effect of such unmanaged resources results in added complexity for aps’s system management 

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies including energy storage technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment the implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems which could require additional infrastructure and resources widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s traditional business model 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could 

table of contents 

make aps’s existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

like many companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 31 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2025 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit train and develop new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic could negatively affect our business 

the outbreak of covid19 is a rapidly developing situation around the globe that has led to economic disruption and volatility in the financial markets the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus could decrease demand for energy lower economic growth impact our employees and contractors cause disruptions in our supply chain increase certain costs further increase volatility in the capital markets and result in increases in the cost of capital or an inability to access the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities delay the completion of capital or other construction projects and other operations and maintenance activities delay payments or increase uncollectable accounts or cause other unpredictable events each of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic from march through december 2020 we have experienced a decrease in demand from commercial and industrial customers and an increase in demand from residential customers and the cumulative impact on weather normalized retail electricity sales usage was a net increase as compared to 2019 aps is also experiencing an increase in bad debt expense associated with the covid19 pandemic that resulted in a negative impact to our 2020 operating results in midmarch 2020 we drew on our revolving credit facilities as a result of the commercial paper markets failing to function normally due to covid19 but we were subsequently able to utilize the commercial paper market in april 2020 and we have paid down the revolving credit facilities completely we are also experiencing increased operations and maintenance expenses due to the need for personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs related to covid19 

despite our efforts to manage the impacts the degree to which the covid19 pandemic and related actions ultimately impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows will depend on factors beyond our control including the duration spread and severity of the outbreak the actions taken to contain covid19 and mitigate its public health effects the impact on the us and global economies and demand for energy and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume 

financial risks 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would 

table of contents 

adversely impact our financial results we could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic social and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other special use funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we recover most of the pension and other postretirement benefit expense and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner could have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

while most of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions have been implemented changes to or repeal of that act and pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps and its ability to make distributions 

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total 

table of contents 

shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to its own debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthecounter “otc” derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

general risks 

proposals to change policy in arizona or other states made through ballot initiatives or referenda may increase the company’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

in arizona and other states a person or organization may file a ballot initiative or referendum with the arizona secretary of state or other applicable state agency and if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are presented the initiative or referendum may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter ballot initiatives and referenda may relate to any matter including policy and regulation related to the electric industry and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact arizona utility customers the arizona economy and the company some ballot initiatives and referenda are drafted in an unclear manner and their potential industry and economic impact can be subject to varied 

table of contents 

and conflicting interpretations we may oppose certain initiatives or referenda including those that could result in negative impacts to our customers the state or the company via the electoral process litigation traditional legislative mechanisms agency rulemaking or otherwise which could result in significant costs to the company the passage of certain initiatives or referenda could result in laws and regulations that impact our business plans and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

• variations in our quarterly operating results 

• operating results that vary from the expectations of management securities analysts and investors 

• changes in expectations as to future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

• developments generally affecting industries in which we operate 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures or capital commitments 

• announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us 

• favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments 

• our dividend policy 

• future sales by the company of equity or equitylinked securities and 

• general domestic and international economic conditions 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or revisions to rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

changes in economic conditions monetary policy fiscal policy financial regulation rating agency treatment or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our 

table of contents 

existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus increase the cost andor reduce the amount of funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

• causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

• increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce funds available to us for operations future investment in our business or other purposes 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

• restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination” transactions with an “interested shareholder” generally any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates who beneficially owned 10 or more of our outstanding voting power at any time during the prior three years or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met 

• antigreenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5 of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied 

• the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of and fill vacancies on the board of directors whether resulting from such increase or from death resignation disqualification or otherwise 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and with respect to preferred stock the other terms including preferences and voting rights of those shares without shareholder approval 

• restrictions that limit the rights of our shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders and 

• restrictions regarding the rights of our shareholders to nominate directors or to submit proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings 

while these provisions may have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

overview 

business overview 

pinnacle west is an investorowned electric utility holding company based in phoenix arizona with consolidated assets of about 20 billion for over 130 years pinnacle west and our affiliates have provided energy and energyrelated products to people and businesses throughout arizona 

pinnacle west derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary aps aps is arizona’s largest and longestserving electric company that generates safe affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 13 million retail customers in 11 of arizona’s 15 counties aps is also the operator and coowner of palo verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwest united states and the largest nuclear power plant in the united states 

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to be a rapidly evolving situation it has led to economic disruption and volatility in financial markets worldwide the company is operating under longstanding pandemic and business continuity plans that exist to address situations including pandemics like covid19 we are focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees contractors and the general public by helping limit the spread of this virus and ensuring continued safe and reliable electric service for aps customers 

we have identified businesscritical positions in our operations and support organizations with backup personnel ready to assist if an issue were to arise additionally efforts to ensure the health and safety of our employees have resulted in bifurcated control rooms thus reducing the number of employees in missioncritical locations we also established covid19 safety protocols social distancing practices including limiting one employee per vehicle and offering virtual options whenever possible the company also took rapid action to implement an all company covid19 hotline a focused covid19 team and procured onsite covid19 testing at key facilities early in the pandemic through this testing case management and contact tracing the company has been able to significantly limit covid19 transmission in the workplace as a result of these efforts we have been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide to our customers while also managing the spread of the virus and promoting the health physical and mental wellbeing and safety of our employees customers and communities

essential planned work and capital investments are continuing during the pandemic with some nonessential planned work postponed to the first quarter of 2021 aps has continuous discussions with suppliers on manpower and supply issues pertaining to covid19 and has measures in place to continue to monitor resource needs and supply chain adequacy at this time aps does not believe it has any material supply chain risks due to covid19 that would impact its ability to serve customers’ needs 

the company’s operations and maintenance expenses exclusive of bad debt expense increased by approximately 25 million for the year ended december 31 2020 due to costs for personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs related to covid19 we expect the company’s operation and maintenance expenses will continue to be impacted for 2021 by the need for additional personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs related to covid19 

while the total expected impact of covid19 on future sales is currently unknown aps has experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales since the outset of the pandemic from march 13 2020 through december 31 2020 the cumulative impact in weathernormalized usage was approximately a 1 increase during that period aps’s retail electric residential weathernormalized sales increased 5 and its retail electric commercial and industrial weathernormalized sales decreased 4 in the aggregate aps expects the reduction in electric demand from commercial and industrial customers and increased demand from residential customers to normalize somewhat during 2021 as business activity continues to recover and more people return to work based on past experience a 1 variation in our annual kwh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 20 million 

on march 31 2020 a stay at home order became effective for the state of arizona and remained in effect until may 16 2020 when it was lifted and arizona began reopening in june 2020 arizona saw an increase in the number of covid19 cases hospitalizations and deaths accordingly on june 29 2020 the governor of arizona closed bars indoor gyms and fitness clubs or centers indoor movie theaters water parks and tubing operations until july 27 2020 as a partial reversal of the state’s reopening and to mitigate the spread of covid19 on july 23 2020 the governor of arizona extended these closures and they remained in place until august 27 2020 when bars gyms and movie theaters reopened with certain restrictions we cannot predict the impact of the spread of covid19 in arizona whether there will be additional reclosures and how any such reclosures will impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows we are continuing to monitor the impacts of covid19 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic in midmarch 2020 the commercial paper markets failed to function normally and we were unable to utilize commercial paper as our primary method of acquiring shortterm capital which resulted in us drawing on our revolving credit facilities during the first quarter of 2020 in midapril 2020 we were again able to utilize the commercial paper market and we have paid down the entire amount of the revolving credit facilities that were utilized as a result of the commercial paper market failure 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act allows employers to defer payments of the employer share of social security payroll taxes that would have otherwise been owed from march 27 2020 through december 31 2020 we deferred the cash payment of the employer’s portion of social security payroll taxes for the period july 1 2020 through december 31 2020 that was approximately 18 million we will pay half of this cash deferral by december 31 2021 and the remainder by december 31 2022

on june 30 2020 ferc issued an order granting a waiver request related to the existing afudc rate calculation beginning march 1 2020 through february 28 2021 the order provides a simplified approach that companies may elect to implement in order to minimize the significant distorted effect on the afudc formula resulting from increased shortterm debt financing during the covid19 pandemic aps has adopted this simplified approach to computing the afudc composite rate by using a simple average of the actual historical shortterm debt balances for 2019 instead of current period shortterm debt balances and has left all other aspects of the afudc formula composite rate calculation unchanged this change impacts the afudc composite rate in 2020 but does not impact prior years furthermore the change in the composite rate calculation does not impact our accounting treatment for these costs the change did not have a material impact on our financial statements see note 1 

due to the covid19 pandemic aps voluntarily suspended disconnections of customers for nonpayment beginning march 13 2020 in addition aps waived all late payment fees during this suspension period on september 14 2020 aps extended this suspension of disconnection of customers for nonpayment and waiver of late payment fees until december 31 2020 the suspension of disconnection of customers for nonpayment ended on january 1 2021 and customers were automatically placed on eightmonth payment arrangements if they had past due balances at the end of the disconnection period of 75 or greater aps will continue to waive late payment fees until october 15 2021 aps has experienced and is continuing to experience an increase in bad debt expense associated with the covid19 pandemic the summer disconnection moratorium see note 4 the suspension of disconnections during the covid19 pandemic and the increased bad debt expense associated with both events resulted in a negative impact to its 2020 operating results of approximately 23 million pretax above the impact of disconnections on its operating results for years that did not have the summer disconnection moratorium or covid19 pandemic aps also currently estimates that the summer disconnection moratorium the suspension of disconnections during the covid19 pandemic and the increased bad debt expense associated with this will result in a negative impact to its 2021 operating results of approximately 20 million to 30 million pretax above the impact of disconnections on its operating results for years that did not have the summer disconnection moratorium or covid19 pandemic these estimated impact amounts for 2021 depend on certain current assumptions including but not limited to customer behaviors population and employment growth and the impacts of covid19 on the economy additionally due to covid19 aps delayed the reset of the eis adjustor and suspended the discontinuation of team phase ii to the first billing cycle in may 2020 rather than april 2020 and and also delayed the reset of the psa to the first billing cycle of april 2021 rather than february 2021 see note 4 

on april 17 2020 aps filed an application with the acc requesting a covid19 emergency relief package to provide additional assistance to its customers on may 5 2020 the acc approved aps returning 36 million that had been collected through the dsm adjustor charge but not allocated for current dsm programs directly to customers through a bill credit in june 2020 see note 4 as of december 31 2020 aps had refunded approximately 43 million to customers the additional 7 million over the approved amount of 36 million was the result of the kwh credit being based on historic consumption which was different than actual consumption in the refund period this difference was recorded to the dsm balancing account and will be addressed in subsequent dsm filings 

aps has spent more than 15 million to assist customers and local nonprofits and community organizations to help with the impact of the covid19 pandemic with 124 million of these dollars directly committed to bill assistance programs the “covid customer support fund” the covid customer support fund was comprised of a series of voluntary commitments of funds that are not recoverable through rates throughout 2020 of approximately 88 million an additional 36 million in bill credits for limited income customers was ordered by the acc in december 2020 of which 50 up to a

strategic overview 

our strategy is to deliver shareholder value by creating a sustainable energy future for arizona by serving our customers with clean reliable and affordable energy 

clean energy commitment 

we are committed to doing our part to make the future clean and carbonfree our vision for aps and arizona presents an opportunity to engage with customers communities employees policymakers shareholders and others to achieve a shared sustainable vision for arizona this goal is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for aps’s customers 

aps’s new clean energy goals consist of three parts 

• a 2050 goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity 

• a 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65 clean energy with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy and 

• a commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 

aps’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of important external factors some of which include a supportive regulatory environment sales and customer growth development of clean energy technologies and continued access to capital markets 

2050 goal 100 clean carbonfree electricity achieving a fully clean carbonfree energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration the 2050 goal will involve new thinking and depends on improved and new technologies 

2030 goal 65 clean energy aps has an energy mix that is already 50 clean with existing plans to add more renewables and energy storage before 2025 by building on those plans aps intends to attain an energy mix that is 65 clean by 2030 with 45 of aps’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy clean is measured as percent of energy mix which includes carbonfree resources like nuclear and demandside management and renewable is expressed as a percent of retail sales this target will 

table of contents 

serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning investment strategy and customer affordability efforts as aps moves toward 100 clean carbonfree energy mix by 2050 

2031 goal end aps’s use of coalfired generation the commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 will require aps to cease use of coalgeneration at four corners aps has permanently retired more than 1000 mw of coalfired electric generating capacity these closures and other measures taken by aps have resulted in a total reduction of carbon emissions of 26 since 2005 in addition aps has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining cholla units by 2025 

aps un derstands that the transition away from coalfired power plants toward a clean energy future will pose unique economic challenges for the communities around these plants we worked collaboratively with stakeholders and leaders of the navajo nation to consider the impacts of ceasing operation of aps coalfired power plants on the communities surrounding those facilities to propose a comprehensive coal community transition cct plan the proposed framework provides substantial financial and economic development support to build new economic opportunities and addresses a transition strategy for plant employees we are committed to continuing our longrunning partnership with the navajo nation in other areas as well including expanding electrification and developing tribal renewable projects our proposed cct plan supports the navajo nation where the four corners power plant is located the communities surrounding the cholla power plant and the hopi tribe which is impacted by closure of the navajo plant the cct plan is currently pending acc approval see note 4 for a discussion of the cct plan 

renewables aps intends to strengthen its already diverse energy mix by increasing its investments in carbonfree resources its nearterm actions include competitive solicitations to procure clean energy resources such as solar wind energy storage demand response and dsm resources all of which lead to a cleaner grid  

aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas aps’s clean energy strategy includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid see “business of arizona public service company — energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources — renewable energy standard — renewable energy portfolio” in item 1 for details regarding aps’s renewable energy resources 

palo verde  palo verde the nation’s largest carbonfree clean energy resource will continue to be a foundational part of aps’s resource portfolio the plant currently supplies nearly 70 of our clean energy and provides the foundation for the reliable and affordable service for aps customers palo verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwest united states the plant’s continued operation is important to a carbonfree and clean energy future for arizona and the region as a reliable continuous affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy 

affordable 

we believe it is aps’s responsibility to deliver electric services to customers in the most costeffective manner since january 2018 through december 2020 the average residential bill decreased by 73 or 1095 

table of contents 

building upon existing cost management efforts aps launched a customer affordability initiative in 2019 the initiative was implemented companywide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes and organizational approaches to completing highvalue work and internal efficiencies through the initiative and existing cost management practices aps met its goal of 20 million in cost savings as of december 31 2020 

participation in the eim continues to be an effective tool for creating savings for apss customers from the realtime voluntary market aps continues to expect that its participation in eim will lower its fuel and purchasedpower costs improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources aps is in discussions with the eim operator caiso and other eim participants about the feasibility of creating a voluntary dayahead market to achieve more cost savings and use the region’s renewable resources more efficiently 

reliable 

while our energy mix evolves the obligation to deliver reliable service to our customers remains notwithstanding the challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic as well as the hottest summer on record aps continued to provide reliable service to its customers in 2020 setting a new alltime high peak energy demand of 7660 mw exceeding the prior peak set in 2017 by nearly 300 mw and achieved strong reliability results 

planned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid updating technology accommodating customer growth and enabling more renewable energy resources our advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid the system also integrates a new meter data management system that increases grid visibility and gives customers access to more of their energy usage data 

wildfire safety remains a critical focus for aps and other utilities we increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities these programs contribute to customer reliability responsible forest management and safe communities 

the new units at our modernized ocotillo power plant provide cleanerrunning and more efficient units they support reliability by responding quickly to the variability of solar generation and delivering energy in the late afternoon and early evening when solar production declines as the sun sets and customer demand peaks 

customerfocused 

customers are at the core of what aps does every day and its focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves it is aps’s goal to achieve an industryleading bestinclass customer experience 

in 2020 aps adopted a number of changes to improve customer experience it transitioned to a 247 care center operation to better serve its customers around the clock aps improved its call center performance answering nearly 75 of its more than 15 million telephone calls in 30 seconds or less aps 

table of contents 

has also made many improvements to its digital experience through its apscom site and its overall digital experience continues to improve for its customers 

aps also convened a customer advisory board and stakeholder committee in 2020 to serve as a vehicle for gathering valuable qualitative insights directly from customers and stakeholders that intends to keep aps apprised of customer needs wants and perspectives additionally the customer advisory board is leveraged to identify and diagnose potential customer pain points and to help shape and cocreate customer solutions 

aps is also providing assistance to residential and business customers that have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic see “covid19 pandemic” above for more information about customer support during covid19 

emerging technologies 

energy storage 

aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage storage can provide capacity improve power quality be utilized for system regulation integrate renewable generation and in certain circumstances be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments energy storage can also aid in integrating higher levels of renewables by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale energy storage projects to benefit customers to increase renewable utilization and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid we are preparing for additional energy storage in the future 

in early 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under the agreement was scheduled to begin in 2021 however aps terminated the agreement effective february 16 2021 because the facility will not meet the expected inservice date in 2018 aps issued an rfp for approximately 106 mw of energy storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon its evaluation of the rfp responses aps decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site these battery storage facilities are expected to be in service by june 2022 additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year ppas for energy storage totaling 150 mw in april 2019 a battery module in aps’s mcmicken battery energy storage facility experienced an equipment failure which prompted an internal investigation to determine the cause aps has now completed its investigation of the mcmicken battery incident and is working with all counterparties to ensure that the learnings from the investigation and the corresponding safety requirements are incorporated into all battery storage projects going forward including the projects associated with the two abovereferenced ppas these ppas were also subject to acc approval in order to allow for cost recovery through the psa aps received the requested acc approval on january 12 2021 and service under both agreements is expected to begin in 2022 

we currently plan to install at least 850 mw of energy storage by 2025 including the energy storage projects under ppas and az sun retrofits described above the remaining energy storage is expected to be made up of resources solicited through current and future rfps currently aps has two rfps in the market that seek energy storage resources i a battery storage rfp for projects to be located at the remaining two az sun sites that were not included in the 2018 rfp referenced in the preceding paragraph and ii an ‘all source’ rfp that solicits both standalone energy storage and renewable energy plus energy storage resources such resources would be expected to be in service during 2023 and 2024

electric vehicles 

aps is making electric vehicle charging more accessible for its customers and helping arizona businesses schools and governments electrify their fleets in 2020 aps expanded its take charge az pilot program and installed 84 dualplug level 2 charging stations at business customer locations with more stations expected to be added through 2021 the program provides charging equipment installation and maintenance to business customers government agencies and multifamily housing communities in addition to the level 2 charging stations aps will begin construction of direct current fast charging stations that will be owned and operated by aps at five locations in arizona this project is projected to be completed by the end of 2021 with each location including 2150 kilowatt and 2350 kilowatt dc fast charging stations these stations will be accessible through the electrify america charging network 

the acc ordered the state’s public service corporations including aps to develop a longterm comprehensive statewide transportation electrification plan “te plan” for arizona the te plan is intended to provide a roadmap for transportation electrification in arizona focused on realizing the associated air quality and economic development benefits for all residents in the state along with understanding the impact of electric vehicle charging on the grid aps is actively participating in this process which is scheduled to be completed by march 2021 and submitted to the acc for review and approval 

hydrogen production 

palo verde in partnership with idaho national laboratory and two other utilities has been chosen by the doe’s office of nuclear energy to participate in a hydrogen production project with the goal to improve the longterm economic competitiveness of the nuclear power industry the multiphase project is planned for 2020 through 2023 in the first phase idaho national laboratory will perform a technical and economic assessment of using electricity generated at palo verde to produce hydrogen 

experience from palo verde’s utility partners’ demonstration projects and from the palo verdespecific technical economic assessment is expected to offer insights into methods for flexible transitions between electricity and hydrogen generation in solardominated electricity markets 

carbon capture 

carbon capture technologies can isolate co 2 and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products currently almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen carbon capture technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise they are still being tested in realworld conditions these technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired aps will continue to monitor this emerging technology

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2018 through 2020 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 95 of our total operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 23 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the prioryear period for the three years 2018 through 2020 aps’s customer growth averaged 20 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15 to 25 for 2021 and for 2021 through 2023 based on our assessment of steady population growth in arizona 

table of contents 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the prioryear period while steady customer growth was offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong residential sales due to workfromhome policies and a gradual improvement in sales to commercial and industrial customers though the total expected impact of covid19 on future sales is currently unknown aps has experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales since the outset of the pandemic from march 13 2020 through december 31 2020 the cumulative impact on weathernormalized usage was approximately a 1 increase during that period aps’s retail electric residential weathernormalized sales increased 5 and its retail electric commercial and industrial weathernormalized sales decreased 4 in the aggregate aps expects the reduction in electric demand from commercial and industrial customers and increased demand from residential customers to normalize somewhat into 2021 as business activity continues to recover and more people return to work 

for the three years 2018 through 2020 annual retail electricity sales were about flat adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 05 to 15 for 2021 and increase on average in the range of 10 to 20 during 2021 through 2023 including the effects of customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations this projected sales growth range now includes our estimated contributions of several large data centers but not all and we will continue to estimate contributions and evaluate sales guidance as these customers develop more usage history these estimates could be further impacted by slower than expected growth of the arizona economy slower than expected rampup of the new data centers or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency distributed renewable generation initiatives 

consistent with our focus on continuously looking for improvement in our processes and procedures we updated our weather normalization methodology in 2020 to better leverage available ami data smart meter data while the prior method only used one to two months of daily usage data to estimate weather impacts the new method utilizes a rolling fouryear period of daily usage data which improves the accuracy of estimated weather impacts on energy sales since many more data points are used for each calculation our 14 weather normalized sales growth for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects this change in methodology the impact to our 20182020 average normalized sales growth from this change in methodology is 02 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation rampup of data centers impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a 1 variation in our annual kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 20 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 25 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 15 million

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation unplanned outages planned outages typically scheduled in the spring and fall renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “liquidity and capital resources” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities 

  

pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net    pension and other postretirement nonservice credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costscredit the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 108 of the assessed value for 2020 109 for 2019 and 110 for 2018 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units and transmission and distribution facilities 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted and was generally effective on january 1 2018 changes impacting the company include a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utilities and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized see note 5 for details of the impacts on the company as of december 31 2020 in aps’s 2017 rate case decision the acc approved the team which is being used to pass through the income tax effects to retail customers of the tax act see note 4 for details of the team

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 7 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s only reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily sales supplied under traditional costbased rate regulation and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

operating results – 2020 compared with 2019 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2020 was 551 million compared with 538 million for the prior year the results reflect an increase of approximately 13 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to higher revenue driven by the effects of weather and lower refunds in the current year related to the tax act higher pension and other postretirement nonservice credits and higher revenue from customer growth partially offset by higher income taxes including lower amortization of excess deferred taxes higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher other expenses weather had a significant impact on our result of operations due to the hotter than normal weather in 2020 compared to 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2020 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 51 its total shareholder equity was approximately 62 billion and total capitalization was approximately 122 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 49 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financings and equity infusions from pinnacle west

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2020 the ratio was approximately 54 for pinnacle west and 49 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could “crossdefault” other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those 

table of contents 

judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets andor a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings except for pension benefits which would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential acc or ferc commissionordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities we had 1426 million of regulatory assets and 2679 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2020

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit assets liabilities and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2020 reported pension assets and liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2020 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts fund investments held in our other special use funds certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures 

asset retirement obligations 

we recognize an aro for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible longlived assets for which a legal obligation exists the aro liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets aro measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability we use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an aro this approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes the scenarios consider settlement of the aro at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected decommissioning dates the fair value of an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the longlived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets in addition we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded aro for these assets in accordance with gaap accounting aps accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets even if there is no legal obligation for removal 

aros as of december 31 2020 are described further in note 12

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle — the participant owners of palo verde are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

• mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

• conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

• enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

• fabrication of fuel assemblies 

• utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

• storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2025 and 30 through 2028 100 of palo verde’s requirements for conversion services through 2025 and 40 through 2030 100 of palo verde’s requirements for enrichment services through 2021 90 for 2022 and 80 for 2023 through 2026 and 100 of palo verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 

  

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several legal proceedings followed challenging doe’s withdrawal of its yucca mountain construction authorization application and the nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application which were consolidated into one matter at the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” following the dc circuit’s august 2013 order the nrc issued two volumes of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application publication of these volumes do not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository aps is directly involved in legal proceedings related to the doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the palo verde participants filed a lawsuit against the doe in the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims for damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe in the court of federal claims this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract for failing to accept palo verde’s 

table of contents 

spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the standard contract and the nwpa on august 18 2014 aps and the doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment by the doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 in addition the settlement agreement provides aps with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through december 31 2016 which was extended to december 31 2019 

aps has submitted and received payment for five claims pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement for five separate time periods during july 1 2011 through june 30 2018 the doe has paid 843 million for these claims aps’s share is 245 million the amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income apss next claim pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement was submitted to the doe on october 31 2019 in the amount of 16 million apss share is 47 million on february 11 2020 the doe approved a payment of 154 million aps’s share is 45 million 

  waste confidence and continued storage — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel renamed as the continued storage rule the nrc’s decision adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses the final continued storage rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals in june 2016 the dc circuit issued its final decision rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the continued storage rule on august 8 2016 the dc circuit denied a petition for rehearing 

  

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility we are on track to meet the current site specific decommissioning costs for palo verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned see note 20 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts

four corners — four corners is located in the northwestern corner of new mexico and was originally a 5unit coalfired power plant aps owns 100 of units 1 2 and 3 which were retired as of december 30 2013 aps operates the plant and owns 63 of four corners units 4 and 5 aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 970 mw additionally 4ca a whollyowned subsidiary of pinnacle west owned 7 of units 4 and 5 from july 2016 through july 2018 following its acquisition of el pasos interest in these units described below as part of apss recently announced clean energy commitment aps has committed to eliminate coalfired generation from its portfolio of electricity generating resources including four corners by 2031 

  

ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine that serves four corners and develop other energy projects is the coal supplier for four corners the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 the 2016 coal supply agreement el paso a 7 owner of units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

on june 29 2018 4ca and ntec entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the sale to ntec of 4cas 7 interest in four corners the sale transaction closed on july 3 2018 ntec purchased the 7 interest at 4ca’s book value approximately 70 million and is paying 4ca the purchase price over a

period of four years pursuant to a secured interestbearing promissory note in connection with the sale pinnacle west guaranteed certain obligations that ntec will have to the other owners of four corners such as ntecs 7 share of capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses pinnacle wests guarantee is secured by a portion of apss payments to be owed to ntec under the 2016 coal supply agreement 

the 2016 coal supply agreement contained alternate pricing terms for the 7 interest in the event ntec did not purchase the interest until the time that ntec purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions were applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms included a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales the amount under this formula for calendar year 2018 up to the date that ntec purchased the 7 interest was approximately 10 million which was due to 4ca on december 31 2019 such payment was satisfied in january 2020 by ntec directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of future coal payment obligations 

  

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the endangered species act esa and the national environmental policy act nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at four corners and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 

on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity on september 11 2017 the arizona district court issued an order granting ntecs motion dismissing the litigation with prejudice and terminating the proceedings on november 9 2017 the environmental group plaintiffs appealed the district court order dismissing their lawsuit on july 29 2019 the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the september 2017 dismissal of the lawsuit after which the environmental group plaintiffs petitioned the ninth circuit for rehearing on september 12 2019 the ninth circuit denied this petition for rehearing on december 11 2019 

  

cholla — cholla was originally a 4unit coalfired power plant which is located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 and aps operates that unit for pacificorp on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close its 260 mw unit 2 at cholla and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s if epa approved a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit which was later addressed in the march 27 2017 settlement agreement regarding apss general retail case the 2017 settlement agreement see note 4 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and allowed recovery set forth in the 2017 settlement agreement aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the longterm than the benefits that would have resulted from adding the emissions control equipment aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 following the closure of unit 2 aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 387 mw in early 2017 epa 

table of contents 

approved a final rule incorporating apss compromise proposal which took effect for cholla on april 26 2017 in december 2019 pacificorp notified aps that it plans to retire cholla unit 4 by the end of 2020 

aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 in addition aps has a coal transportation contract that runs through 2020 with the ability to extend the contract annually through 2024 

  

navajo plant — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in units 1 2 and 3 aps had a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements were purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo plant was under contract with its coal supplier through 2019 with extension rights through 2026 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant would remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that allows for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations in november 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 4 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and which may be material

solar facilities 

aps developed utility scale solar resources through the 170 mw accapproved az sun program investing approximately 675 million in this program these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona in addition to the az sun program aps developed the 40 mw red rock solar plant which it owns and operates two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from aps that are equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that red rock is projected to generate 

  

aps owns and operates more than thirty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar systems in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 was a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona the pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 rate case decision the participants have been transferred to the solar partner program described below additionally aps owns 13 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing an apsowned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid the first stage of the program called the solar partner 

table of contents 

program placed 8 mw of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as made systems available to limitedincome customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties the second stage of the program which included an additional 2 mw of rooftop solar and energy storage placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 mw on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various gridrelated operation improvements and system interoperability and was in operation by the end of 2016 the costs for this program have been included in apss rate base as part of the 2017 rate case decision 

in the 2017 rate case decision the acc also approved the aps solar communities program aps solar communities formerly az sun ii is a threeyear program authorizing aps to spend 10 million  15 million in capital costs each year to install utilityowned distributed generation systems on low to moderate income residential homes nonprofit entities title i schools and rural government facilities the 2017 rate case decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses property taxes marketing and advertising expenses and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the res currently aps has installed 5 mw of distributed generation systems under the aps solar communities program 

energy storage 

aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage storage can provide capacity improve power quality be utilized for system regulation integrate renewable generation and can be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments energy storage can also aid in integrating higher levels of renewables by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale energy storage projects to benefit customers to increase renewable utilization and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid we are preparing for additional energy storage in the future 

in early 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under this agreement is scheduled to begin in 2021 in 2018 aps issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 mw of energy storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon our evaluation of the request for proposals rfp responses aps decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site in february 2019 we contracted for the 141 mw and originally anticipated such facilities could be in service by mid2020 in april 2019 a battery module in aps’s mcmicken battery energy storage facility experienced an equipment failure which prompted an internal investigation to determine the cause the results of the investigation will inform the timing of our utilization and implementation of batteries on our system due to the april 2019 event aps is working with the counterparty for the az sun sites to determine appropriate timing and path forward for such facilities additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year power purchase agreements for energy storage totaling 150 mw service under these power purchase agreements is also dependent on the results of the mcmicken battery incident investigation and requires approval from the acc to allow for recovery of these agreements through the psa see note 4 for details related to the psa 

we currently plan to install at least 850 mw of energy storage by 2025 including the 150 mw of energy storage projects under power purchase agreements described above the additional 700 mw of apsowned energy storage is expected to be made up of the retrofits associated with our az sun sites as described above along with current and future rfps for energy storage and solar plus energy storage projects given the april 2019 event we continue to evaluate the appropriate timing and path forward to support the overall capacity goals for our system and associated energy storage requirements currently aps is pursuing an rfp for batteryready solar resources up to 150 mw with results expected in the first half of 2020

 current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2019 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on august 5 2019 at 7115 mw compared to the 2018 peak of 7320 mw recorded on july 24 2018 the reduction was largely driven by milder peak day weather conditions in 2019 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2019 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 16 for 2020 due to expiring purchased power contracts aps is procuring market resources to maintain its minimum 15 planning reserve criteria

energy imbalance market 

in 2015 aps and the caiso the operator for the majority of californias transmission grid signed an agreement for aps to begin participation in the energy imbalance market “eim” apss participation in the eim began on october 1 2016 the eim allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15minute blocks with dispatching every five minutes before the energy is needed instead of the traditional one hour blocks aps continues to expect that its participation in eim will lower its fuel costs improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources 

renewable energy standard 

  

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 10 of retail electric sales in 2020 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 general retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to use its best efforts to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to any existing resources or commitments as of the end of 2008 aps met its settlement commitment in 2015 

  

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 10 in 2020 on july 1 2019 aps filed its 2020 res implementation plan the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

  



table of contents 

on april 21 2015 the res rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy the rules allow the acc to consider such information in determining whether aps has satisfied the requirements of the res see energy modernization plan in note 4 for information regarding an additional renewable energy standards proposal 

renewable energy portfolio to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1923 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 1828 mw are currently in operation and 95 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 240 mw of facilities owned by aps 626 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 962 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps see energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  solar facilities above for information regarding apsowned solar facilities 

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development as of december 31 2019 agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid

demand side management 

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed ees of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 4 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations 

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates see note 4 for information regarding accs regulation of apss retail electric rates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another in february of 2015 

on november 17 2018 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona an acc special open meeting workshop was held on december 3 2018 no substantive action was taken but interested parties were asked to submit written comments and respond to a list of questions from acc staff on july 1 and july 2 2019 acc staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules interested parties filed comments to the acc staff report and a stakeholder meeting and workshop to discuss the retail electric competition rules and energy modernization plan proposals was held on july 30 2019 acc commissioners submitted additional questions regarding this matter on february 10 2020 two acc commissioners filed 

table of contents 

two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules on february 12 2020 acc staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the acc’s retail electric competition rules the acc has scheduled a workshop for february 2526 2020 for further consideration and discussion of the retail electric competition rules aps cannot predict whether these efforts will result in any changes and if changes to the rules results what impact these rules would have on aps 

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 4 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2019 approximately 53 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

transmission and delivery   

aps continues to work closely with customers stakeholders and regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that support new customers system reliability access to markets and clean energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the liquidity and capital resources section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes new aps transmission projects along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements including those for data center development aps is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage minimize system outage durations and frequency enable customer choice for new customer sited technologies and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions 

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative initiatives there have been no recent successful attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate ghg emissions and it is unclear at this time whether pending climatechange related legislation in the 116th congress will be considered in the senate and then signed into law by president trump in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is written and enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co2” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona at this time the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 

table of contents 

2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review nsr analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 19 2019 epa took final action on its proposals to repeal epas 2015 clean power plan “cpp” and replace those regulations with a new rule the affordable clean energy “ace” regulations epa originally finalized the cpp on august 3 2015 and those regulations had been stayed pending judicial review 

the ace regulations are based upon measures that can be implemented to improve the heat rate of steamelectric power plants specifically coalfired egus in contrast with the cpp epas ace regulations would not involve utilitylevel generation dispatch shifting away from coalfired generation and toward renewable energy resources and natural gasfired combined cycle power plants epa’s ace regulations provide states and epa regions eg the navajo nation with three years to develop plans establishing sourcespecific standards of performance based upon application of the ace rule’s heatrate improvement emission guidelines while corresponding nsr reform regulations were proposed as part of epa’s initial ace proposal the finalized ace regulations did not include such reform measures epa announced that it will be taking final action on epas nsr reform proposal for egus in the near future 

we cannot at this time predict the outcome of epas regulatory actions repealing and replacing the cpp various state governments industry organizations and environmental and publichealth public interest groups have filed lawsuits in the dc circuit challenging the legality of epa’s action both in repealing the cpp and issuing the ace regulations in addition to the extent that the ace regulations go into effect as finalized it is not yet clear how the state of arizona or epa will implement these regulations as applied to aps’s coalfired egus in light of these uncertainties aps is still evaluating the impact of the ace regulations on its coalfired generation fleet 

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules  in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis final regulations imposing bart requirements have now been imposed on each aps coalfired power plant four corners was required to install new pollution controls to comply with bart while similar pollution control installation requirements were not necessary for cholla 

cholla aps believed that epa’s original 2012 final rule establishing controls constituting bart for cholla which would require installation of selective catalytic reduction scr controls was unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s state implementation plan sip and promulgating a federal implementation plan fip that was inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations 

table of contents 

under the regional haze program in september 2014 aps met with epa to propose a compromise bart strategy whereby aps would permanently close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s see cholla in note 4 for information regarding future plans for cholla and details related to the resulting regulatory asset aps made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment is unlikely to be required in the future because retiring andor converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more cost effective than and will result in increased visibility improvement over the bart requirements for oxides of nitrogen nox imposed through epas bart fip in early 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating apss compromise proposal which took effect for cholla on april 26 2017 

  

four corners  based on epa’s final standards apss 63 share of the cost of required bart controls for four corners units 4 and 5 was approximately 400 million which has been incurred see note 4 for information regarding the related rate recovery in addition aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el pasos 7 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 ntec purchased the interest from 4ca on july 3 2018 see four corners  4ca matter in note 11 for a discussion of the ntec purchase the cost of the pollution controls related to the 7 interest is approximately 45 million which was assumed by ntec through its purchase of the 7 interest 

  

coal combustion waste on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions these criteria include standards governing location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent’s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity such closure requirements are deemed forced closure or closure for cause of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below 

since these regulations were finalized epa has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing ccr disposal while certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions others have resulted from judicial review courtapproved settlements with environmental groups and statutory changes to rcra the following lists the pending regulatory changes that if finalized could have a material impact as to how aps manages ccr at its coalfired power plants 

 

 

table of contents 

 

 

we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when epa will take final action depending on the eventual outcome the costs associated with aps’s management of ccr could materially increase which could affect aps’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 22 million and its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for cholla is approximately 15 million the navajo plant currently disposes of ccr in a dry landfill storage area to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant apss share of incremental costs is approximately 1 million which has been incurred additionally the ccr rule requires ongoing phased groundwater monitoring 

as of october 2018 aps has completed the statistical analyses for its ccr disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring aps determined that several of its ccr disposal units at cholla and four corners will need to undergo corrective action in addition under the current regulations all such disposal units must cease operating and initiate closure by october 31 2020 aps initiated an assessment of corrective measures on january 14 2019 and expects such assessment will continue through mid to late2020 as part of this assessment aps continues to gather additional groundwater data and perform remedial evaluations as to the ccr disposal units at cholla and four corners undergoing corrective action in addition aps will solicit input from the public host public hearings and select remedies as part of this process based on the work performed to date aps currently estimates that its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at four corners will likely range from 10 million to 15 million which would be incurred over 30 years the analysis needed to perform a similar cost estimate for cholla remains ongoing at this time as aps continues to implement the ccr rule’s corrective action assessment process the current cost estimates may change given uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment process we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to the company however at this time we do not believe the cost estimates for cholla and any potential change to the cost estimate for four corners would have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

effluent limitation guidelines on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate 

table of contents 

on august 11 2017 epa announced that it would be initiating rulemaking proceedings to potentially revise the september 2015 effluent limitation guidelines on september 18 2017 epa finalized a regulation postponing the earliest date on which compliance with the effluent limitation guidelines for these wastestreams would be required from november 1 2018 until november 1 2020 in addition on november 22 2019 epa published a proposed rule relaxing the “zero discharge” limitations for bottomash handling water and allowing for approximately 10 of such wastewater to be discharged on a volumetric 30day rolling average basis subject to bestprofessional judgment effluent limits we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this rulemaking proceeding nonetheless we expect that compliance with the resulting limitations will be required in connection with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes discharge permit renewals at four corners see four corners national pollutant discharge elimination system permit below for more details for the current npdes permit issued to four corners which is subject to an appeal by various environmental groups the plant must comply with the existing “zero discharge” effluent limitation guidelines for bottomash transport wastewater by december 31 2023 if those guidelines are changed it is unclear when four corners would need to demonstrate compliance with any updated or revised standards cholla and the navajo plant do not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” at a level of 70 parts per billion “ppb” with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nox and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 while epa took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on november 6 2017 the agencys final action designating nonattainment areas was not issued until april 30 2018 at that time epa designated the geographic areas containing yuma and phoenix arizona as in nonattainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone naaqs the vast majority of apss natural gasfired egus are located in these jurisdictions areas of arizona and the navajo nation where the remainder of apss fossilfuel fired egu fleet is located were designated as in attainment we anticipate that revisions to the sips and fips implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard will be in place between 2023 and 2024 at this time because proposed sips and fips implementing the revised ozone naaqss have yet to be released aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting aps

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district rid filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area on january 25 2015 adeq sent a letter to aps seeking information concerning the degree to which if any aps’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area aps responded to adeq on may 4 2015 on december 16 2016 two rid environmental and engineering contractors filed an ancillary lawsuit for recovery of costs against aps and the other defendants in the rid litigation that same day another rid service provider filed an additional ancillary cercla lawsuit against certain of the defendants in the main rid litigation but excluded aps and certain other parties as named defendants because the ancillary lawsuits concern past costs allegedly incurred by these rid vendors which were ruled unrecoverable directly by rid in november of 2016 the additional lawsuits do not increase apss exposure or risk related to these matters 

on april 5 2018 rid and the defendants in that particular litigation executed a settlement agreement fully resolving rids cercla claims concerning both past and future cost recovery apss share of this settlement was immaterial in addition the two environmental and engineering vendors voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against aps and the other named defendants without prejudice an order to this effect was entered on april 17 2018 with this disposition of the case the vendors may file their lawsuit again in the future on august 16 2019 maricopa county one of the three direct defendants in the service provider lawsuit filed a thirdparty complaint seeking contribution for its liability if any from aps and 28 other thirdparty defendants we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters however we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under rights of way granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its operating needs the four corners region in which four corners is located has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area however during the past 12 months the region has received snowfall and precipitation sufficient to recover the navajo reservoir to an optimum operating level reducing the probability of shortage in future years although the watershed and reservoirs are in a good condition at this time aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons including a number of gasfired power plants located within maricopa and pinal counties in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

at this time the lower court proceedings in the gila river adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the gila river should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction a hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in march of 2018 in front of a special master and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on may 17 2018 the decision of the special master which was finalized on november 14 2018 but which is subject to further review by the trial court judge accepts the proposed hydrogeologic testing protocols supported by aps and other industrial users of groundwater a final decision by the trial court judge in this matter remains pending further proceedings have been initiated to determine the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations the determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings may ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties such as aps that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations aps cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

little colorado river adjudication aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court a trial is scheduled for june of 2020 regarding the contested claims of the hopi tribe for federal reserve water rights similar claims of the

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of equity and debt securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates including the infusion of equity into aps decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state and local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties approximately 12 million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition 

table of contents 

of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities including palo verde in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases water quality discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

coal ash in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and in a dry landfill storage area at the navajo plant to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal in addition the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from ccr disposal units or the presence of ccr constituents within groundwater near ccr disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds

ozone national ambient air quality standards in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides which set new more stringent standards intended to protect human health and human welfare depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas 

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices or other clean energy rules or initiatives the economics or feasibility of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

aps faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

potential financial risks  greenhouse gas regulation the clean power plan and potential litigation in 2015 epa finalized a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the cpp the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates could result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company epa took action in october 2017 to repeal these regulations and in july 2019 epa published final regulations the ace rule to replace the cpp with a new set of regulations epa’s action in 2019 to repeal the cpp and replace it with the ace regulations is currently subject to pending judicial review in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 

depending on the final outcome of a pending judicial review of ace and repeal of the cpp along with related regulatory activity to implement the ace regulations the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative ghg emission limitations from power plants alternative ghg emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant ghg emissions 

  

physical and operational risks weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest united states desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent a greater challenge as part of conducting its business aps recognizes that the southwestern united states is particularly susceptible to the risks posed by climate change which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the area where aps conducts its business

coowners of our jointly owned generation facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation regulations economic conditions or changes in our industry which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities 

aps owns certain of our power plants jointly with other owners with varying ownership interests in such facilities changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources fuel costs legislation and regulation together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities could result in unaligned positions among coowners such differences in the coowners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could ultimately lead to disagreements among the parties as to how and whether to continue operation of such plants which could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets see note 4 for a discussion of the navajo plant and cholla retirement and the related risks associated with apss continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers this is in large part due to a 2004 arizona court of appeals decision that found critical components of the accs rules to be violative of the arizona constitution the ruling also voided the operating authority of all the competitive providers previously authorized by the acc on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

one of these options would be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generationx program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation the agx program was approved by the acc as part of the 2017 settlement agreement 

  

in november 2018 the acc voted to again reexamine retail competition in addition proposals to enable or support retail electric competition may be made from time to time through ballot initiatives legislative action or other forums in arizona the acc has scheduled a workshop for february 2526 2020 for further consideration and discussion of the retail electric competition rules aps cannot predict whether these efforts will result in any changes and if changes to the rules results what impact these rules would have on aps 

table of contents 

proposals to change policy in arizona or other states made through ballot initiatives or referenda may increase the company’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

in arizona and other states a person or organization may file a ballot initiative or referendum with the arizona secretary of state or other applicable state agency and if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are presented the initiative or referendum may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter ballot initiatives and referenda may relate to any matter including policy and regulation related to the electric industry and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact arizona utility customers the arizona economy and the company some ballot initiatives and referenda are drafted in an unclear manner and their potential industry and economic impact can be subject to varied and conflicting interpretations we may oppose certain initiatives or referenda including those that could result in negative impacts to our customers the state or the company via the electoral process litigation traditional legislative mechanisms agency rulemaking or otherwise which could result in significant costs to the company the passage of certain initiatives or referenda could result in laws and regulations that impact our business plans and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

apart from the impact upon electricity demand weather conditions related to prolonged high temperatures or extreme heat events present operational challenges in the southwestern united states where aps conducts its business the effects of climate change are projected to increase the overall average temperature lead to more extreme temperature events and exacerbate prolonged drought conditions leading to the declining availability of water resources extreme heat events and rising temperatures are projected to reduce the generation capacity of thermalpower plants and decrease the efficiency of the transmission grid these operational risks related to rising temperatures and extreme heat events could affect aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition the decrease in snowpack can also lead to reduced water supplies in the areas where aps relies upon nonrenewable water resources to supply cooling and process water for electricity generation prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect aps’s longterm ability to access the water resources necessary for thermal electricity generation operations reductions in the availability of water for power plant cooling could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy resources   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 cumulative annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also 

table of contents 

include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost revenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the lfcr is designed to address these matters 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs 

in addition to these rules and requirements energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in apss service territory increased 20 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prior year for the three years 2017 through 2019 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 18 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15  25 for 2020 and for 2020 through 2022 based on our assessment of improving economic conditions in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 06 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer growth were offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2017 through 2019 annual retail electricity sales were about flat adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 10  20 for 2020 and increase on average in the range of 10  20 during 2020 through 2022 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations and excluding the impacts of several new large data centers opening operations in metro phoenix the impact of new large data centers could raise the range of expected sales annual growth rate over the 2020 to 2022 period but demand from these customers remains uncertain at this point slower than expected growth of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed renewable generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if we experience acceleration of expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives we may be unable to reach our estimated sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected 

table of contents 

levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others concerns over physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  

the impact of wildfires could negatively affect apss results of operations 

wildfires have the potential to affect the communities that aps serves and apss vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities the potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather impacts existing in arizona as those that led to the catastrophic wildfires in northern california while we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets wildfire risk is always present due to apss expansive service territory aps could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires that were caused by or enhanced due to apss negligence the arizona liability standard is different from that of california which generally imposes liability for resulting damages without regard to fault any damage caused to our assets loss of service to our customers or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact apss financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including those related to financing siting permitting new and evolving technology and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in expressing concerns about the environmental and climaterelated impacts from continued extraction transportation delivery and combustion of fossil fuels environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of fossil fuel infrastructure projects these efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables including the future course of federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities aps cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies climate change is also projected to exacerbate prolonged drought conditions aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information there appears to be an increasing level of activity sophistication and maturity of threat actors in particular nation state actors that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the us bulk power transmission and distribution system our information technology systems generation including our palo verde nuclear facility transmission and distribution facilities and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of unauthorized access and are critical areas of cyber protection for us 

we rely extensively on it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of these systems are managed hosted provided or used for third parties to assist in conducting our business as more third parties are involved in the operation of our business there is a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy or security of data held by or accessible to third parties may be compromised 

if a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could i experience property damage disruptions to our business theft of or unauthorized access to customer employee financial or system operation information or other information ii experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair remediation and breach notification and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage if such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded or could delay our response or the effectiveness of our response and ability to limit our exposure to potential liability these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change these systems and processes may be insufficient to mitigate the possibility of information and cybersecurity incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance in the safeguarding of our data 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems 

table of contents 

and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants the increasing promulgation of nerc and nrc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as those promulgated by nerc and the nrc or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties 

the risk of these systemrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems to date we do not believe we have experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations we will not be able to anticipate all cyberattacks or information security breaches and our ongoing investments in security resources talent and business practices may not be effective against all threat actors as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency we may be unable to prevent all such attacks from being successful in the future 

we maintain cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

four corners and portions of certain aps transmission lines are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

table of contents 

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 1201 million but not more than 179 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power reactor in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

table of contents 

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation including carbonfree nuclear generation and increase the complexity of managing apss information technology and power system operations which could adversely affect aps’s business 

customersited alternative energy technologies present challenges to aps’s operations due to misalignment with aps’s existing operational needs when these resources lack “dispatchability” and other elements of utilityside control they are considered “unmanaged” resources the cumulative effect of such unmanaged resources results in added complexity for aps’s system management 

  

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies including energy storage technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment the implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems which could require additional infrastructure and resources widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s traditional business model 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make apss existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like many companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 35 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2024 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit train and develop new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

table of contents 

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy financial regulation or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would adversely impact our financial results we could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

table of contents 

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic social and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other special use funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

while most of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions have been implemented changes to or repeal of that act and pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps and its ability to make distributions 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

table of contents 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to its own debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 



table of contents 

   

while these provisions may have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

overview 

  

business overview 

pinnacle west is an investorowned electric utility holding company based in phoenix arizona with consolidated assets of about 18 billion for over 130 years pinnacle west and our affiliates have provided energy and energyrelated products to people and businesses throughout arizona 

pinnacle west derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary aps aps is arizona’s largest and longestserving electric company that generates safe affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 13 million retail customers in 11 of arizona’s 15 counties aps is also the operator and coowner of palo verde  a primary source of electricity for the southwest united states and the largest nuclear power plant in the united states 

strategic overview 

our strategy is to deliver shareholder value by creating a sustainable energy future for arizona with a clean affordable reliable and customerfocused plan 

clean energy commitment 

we are committed to doing our part to make the future clean and carbonfree our vision for aps and arizona presents an opportunity to engage with customers to achieve clean energy goals guided by science our approach is intended to encourage marketbased and innovative solutions to drive towards a lowcarbon economy we believe clean energy can power a robust economy 

apss new clean energy goals consist of three parts 

• an aspirational 2050 goal to provide 100 clean carbonfree electricity 

 • a commitment to end aps’s use of coalfired generation by 2031 

apss ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of important external factors some of which include a supportive regulatory environment sales and customer growth development of clean energy technologies and continued access to capital markets 

table of contents 

  

2050 aspirational goal 100 clean carbonfree electricity achieving a fully clean carbonfree energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration the 2050 goal will involve new thinking and depends on improved and new technologies 

2030 goal 65 clean electricity aps has an energy mix that is already 50 clean with existing plans to add more renewables and energy storage before 2025 those plans are intended to allow us to attain an energy mix that is 65 clean by 2030 with 45 of apss portfolio coming from renewable energy this target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning investment strategy and customer affordability efforts as aps moves toward 100 clean carbonfree by 2050 

2031 goal end apss use of coalfired generation the commitment to end apss use of coalfired generation by 2031 will require aps to cease buying coalgeneration from four corners aps has permanently retired more than 1000 mw of coalfired electric generating capacity these closures and other measures taken by aps have resulted in a total reduction of carbon emissions of 28 since 2005 in addition aps has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining cholla units by 2025 

renewables aps intends to strengthen its already diverse energy mix by increasing its investments in carbonfree resources its nearterm actions include competitive solicitations to procure clean energy resources such as solar wind energy storage demand response and dsm resources including energy efficiency resources that enable renewable additions and lead to a cleaner grid 

palo verde palo verde is the nation’s largest producer of electricity and the largest source of carbonfree energy the plant supplies nearly 70 of our clean energy and provides the foundation for the reliable and affordable service for aps customers palo verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwest united states the plant’s continued operation is important to a carbonfree and clean energy future for arizona and the region as a reliable continuous affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy 

  

affordable 

we believe it is apss responsibility to deliver electric services to customers in the most costeffective manner since january 2018 the average residential bill decreased by 78 or 1168 due primarily to savings from lower operating costs in areas such as fuel and purchased power and federal tax reform that have been passed on to customers 

building upon existing cost management efforts aps launched a customer affordability initiative in 2019 the initiative was implemented companywide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes and organizational approaches to completing highvalue work and eliminating waste through the initiative and existing cost management practices aps identified 20 million in possible cost savings for 2020 

participation in the eim continues to be an effective tool for creating savings for our customers from the realtime voluntary market over the past three years the eim has delivered approximately 140 million in gross benefits to aps customers aps is in discussions with the eim operator caiso and other eim participants about the feasibility of creating a voluntary dayahead market to achieve more cost savings and use the region’s renewable resources more efficiently 

table of contents 

reliable 

while our energy mix evolves the obligation to deliver reliable service to our customers remains excluding voluntary outages and proactive fire mitigation efforts aps finished 2019 with its best score for frequency of customer power outages 

  

planned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid updating technology accommodating customer growth and enabling more renewable energy resources our advanced management system allows operators to locate outages control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid the system also integrates a new meter data management system that increases grid visibility and gives customers access to more of their energy usage data see liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures below for additional details on capital expenditures 

wildfire safety remains a critical focus for aps and other utilities we increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities these programs contribute to customer reliability responsible forest management and safe communities 

the new units at our modernized ocotillo power plant provide cleanerrunning and more efficient units they support reliability by responding quickly to the variability of solar generation and delivering energy in the late afternoon and early evening when solar production declines as the sun sets and customer demand peaks 

customerfocused 

customers are at the core of what aps does every day and aps is committed to providing options that make it easier for its customers to do business with them in 2019 aps launched its redesigned apscom website and mobile app giving customers upgraded access to their energy usage data and billing information apss customer care team is using speech analytics to enrich advisors’ interactions with customers over the telephone and customers can also communicate with aps through an online chat

emerging technologies 

energy storage 

aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage storage can provide capacity improve power quality be utilized for system regulation integrate renewable generation and in certain circumstances be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments energy storage can also aid in integrating higher levels of renewables by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale energy storage projects to benefit customers to increase renewable utilization and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid we are preparing for additional energy storage in the future 

in early 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under this agreement is scheduled to begin in 2021 in 2018 aps issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 mw of energy storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon our evaluation of the rfp responses aps decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site in february 2019 we contracted for the 141 mw and originally anticipated such facilities could be in service by mid2020 in april 2019 a battery module in aps’s mcmicken battery energy storage facility experienced an equipment failure which prompted an internal investigation to determine the cause the results of the investigation will inform the timing of our utilization and implementation of batteries on our system due to the april 2019 event aps is working with the counterparty for the az sun sites to determine appropriate timing and path forward for such facilities additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year power purchase agreements for energy storage totaling 150 mw service under these power purchase agreements is also dependent on the results of the mcmicken battery incident investigation and requires approval from the acc to allow for recovery of these agreements through the psa 

we currently plan to install at least 850 mw of energy storage by 2025 including the 150 mw of energy storage projects under power purchase agreements described above the additional 700 mw of apsowned energy storage is expected to be made up of the retrofits associated with our az sun sites as described above along with current and future rfps for energy storage and solar plus energy storage projects given the april 2019 event we continue to evaluate the appropriate timing and path forward to support the overall capacity goals for our system and associated energy storage requirements currently aps is pursuing an rfp for batteryready solar resources up to 150 mw with results expected in the first half of 2020 

electric vehicles 

aps plans to make electric vehicle charging more accessible for its customers and help arizona businesses schools and governments electrify their fleets in 2019 aps implemented its take charge az pilot program the program provides charging equipment installation and maintenance to business customers government agencies and multifamily housing communities rates are designed to encourage charging overnight and during daytime offpeak hours when solar energy is abundant 

hydrogen production 

palo verde in partnership with idaho national laboratory and two other utilities has been chosen by the does office of nuclear energy to participate in a hydrogen production project with the goal to improve the longterm economic competitiveness of the nuclear power industry the project planned for 2020 through 2022 will look at how hydrogen from palo verde may be used as energy storage for use in reverseoperable electrolysis or peaking gas turbines during times of the day when photovoltaic solar energy sources are 

table of contents 

unavailable and energy reserves in the southwest united states are low it could also be used to support a rapidly increasing hydrogen transportation fuel market 

experience from the pilot project will offer insights into methods for flexible transitions between electricity and hydrogen generation missions in solardominated electricity markets and demonstrate how hydrogen may be used as energy storage to provide electricity during operating periods when solar is not available 

carbon capture 

carbon capture technologies can isolate atmospheric co 2 and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products currently almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen at the same time these generators are dispatchable they can supply energy quickly as needed for reliability carbon capture technologies offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired there are a number of demonstration projects that show promise but are still being tested in realworld conditions aps will continue to monitor this emerging technology 

regulatory overview 

on october 31 2019 aps filed an application with the acc for an annual increase in retail base rates of 69 million this amount includes recovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the four corners scr project that is currently the subject of a separate proceeding see “scr cost recovery” in note 4 it also reflects a net credit to base rates of approximately 115 million primarily due to the prospective inclusion of rate refunds currently provided through the team the proposed total revenue increase in apss application is 184 million the average annual customer bill impact of aps’s request is an increase of 56 the average annual bill impact for a typical aps residential customer is 54

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

operating revenues   for the years 2017 through 2019 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 95 of our total operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and 

table of contents 

the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 20 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prior year for the three years 2017 through 2019 aps’s customer growth averaged 18 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15  25 for 2020 and for 2020 through 2022 based on our assessment of steady economic growth in arizona 

  

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 06 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prior year steady economic growth and customer growth were offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2017 through 2019 annual retail electricity sales were about flat adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 10  20 for 2020 and increase on average in the range of 10  20 during 2020 through 2022 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations and excluding the impacts of several new large data centers opening operations in metro phoenix the impact of new large data centers could raise the range of expected sales annual growth rate over the 2020 to 2022 period but demand from these customers remains uncertain at this point slower than expected growth of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

  

  actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to approximately 15 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 25 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 15 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation unplanned outages planned outages typically scheduled in the spring and fall renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors 

table of contents 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see liquidity and capital resources below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities and income tax impacts related to bonus depreciation 

  

pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net    pension and other postretirement nonservice credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costscredit the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 109 of the assessed value for 2019 110 for 2018 and 112 for 2017 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units and transmission and distribution facilities 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted and was generally effective on january 1 2018 changes impacting the company include a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utilities and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized see note 5 for details of the impacts on the company as of december 31 2019 in apss 2017 rate case decision the acc approved the team which is being used to pass through the income tax effects to retail customers of the tax act see note 4 for details of the team 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 7 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s only reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily sales supplied under traditional costbased rate regulation and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

operating results – 2019 compared with 2018 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2019 was 538 million  compared with 511 million for the prior year the results reflect an increase of approximately 30 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to lower operations and maintenance costs and tax expense due to amortization of excess deferred taxes as a result of the tax act

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expenses were 10 million higher for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prioryear period primarily due to increased plant in service of 33 million partially offset by the regulatory deferrals for the four corners scr and ocotillo modernization project of 19 million and the deferral of navajo plant costs of 4 million which is offset in operations and maintenance 

taxes other than income taxes   taxes other than income taxes were 7 million higher for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prioryear period primarily due to higher property values 

pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net pension and other postretirement nonservice credits net were 27 million lower for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prioryear period primarily due to lower market returns in 2018 

income taxes   income taxes were 150 million lower for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the prioryear period primarily due to amortization of excess deferred taxes and lower pretax income in the current year period see note 5 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40  as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2019 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 52  its total shareholder equity was approximately 59 billion  and total capitalization was approximately 112 billion  under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 45 billion  assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financings and equity infusions from pinnacle west

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2019  the ratio was approximately 52 for pinnacle west and 47 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of crossdefault provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

table of contents 

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets andor a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings except for pension benefits which would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential acc or ferc commissionordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities we had 1507 million of regulatory assets and 2503 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2019 

  

see notes 1 and 4 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2019 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2019 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments held in our other special use funds certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and note 14 for fair value measurement disclosures 

asset retirement obligations 

we recognize an aro for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible longlived assets for which a legal obligation exists the aro liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets aro measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability we use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an aro this approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes the scenarios consider settlement of the aro at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected

decommissioning dates the fair value of an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the longlived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets in addition we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded aro for these assets in accordance with gaap accounting aps accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets even if there is no legal obligation for removal

supplier and operator of the mine that served four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 the 2016 coal supply agreement el paso a 7 owner of units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation see note 10 for a discussion of certain matters related to the 2016 coal supply agreement on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

ntec had the option to purchase the 7 interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the purchase did not occur during the originally contemplated timeframe concurrent with the settlement of the 2016 coal supply agreement matter described in note 10 ntec and 4ca agreed to allow for the purchase by ntec of the 7 interest consistent with the option on june 29 2018 4ca and ntec entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the sale to ntec of 4cas 7 interest in four corners completion of the sale was subject to the receipt of approval by ferc which was received on july 2 2018 and the sale transaction closed on july 3 2018 ntec purchased the 7 interest at 4ca’s book value approximately 70 million and will pay 4ca the purchase price over a period of four years pursuant to a secured interestbearing promissory note in connection with the sale pinnacle west guaranteed certain obligations that ntec will have to the other owners of four corners such as ntecs 7 share of capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses pinnacle wests guarantee is secured by a portion of apss payments to be owed to ntec under the 2016 coal supply agreement 

the 2016 coal supply agreement contained alternate pricing terms for the 7 interest in the event ntec did not purchase the interest until the time that ntec purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions were applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms included a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales such payments are due to 4ca at the end of each calendar year a 10 million payment was due to 4ca at december 31 2017 which ntec satisfied by directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of a portion of a future mine reclamation obligation the balance of the amount under this formula due december 31 2018 for calendar year 2017 is approximately 20 million which was paid to 4ca on december 14 2018 the balance of the amount under this formula at december 31 2018 for calendar year 2018 up to the date that ntec purchased the 7 interest is approximately 10 million which is due to 4ca at december 31 2019 

  

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the endangered species act esa and the national environmental policy act nepa in providing the

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant will remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that will allow for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceases operations in december 2019 various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives the plants coal supplier and doi have been meeting to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 although we cannot predict whether any alternate plans will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement we believe it is probable that the current owners of the navajo plant will cease plant operations in 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset

the participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 in 2018 a fabrication contract was executed with a new fabrication supplier for unit 2 and the existing fabrication contract was renegotiated for units 1 and 3 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 aps is directly and indirectly involved in several legal proceedings related to the doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the palo verde participants filed a lawsuit against the doe in the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims for damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded 302 million in damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe in the court of federal claims this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the doe’s breach of the standard contract for failing to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the standard contract and the nwpa on august 18 2014 aps and the doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment of 574 million by the doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 aps’s share of this amount is 167 million amounts recovered in the lawsuit and settlement were recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on the amount of reported net income in addition the settlement agreement provides aps with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through december 31 2016 which has been extended to december 31 2019 

aps has submitted and received payment for four claims pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement for four separate time periods during july 1 2011 through june 30 2018 the doe has paid 742 million for these claims aps’s share is 216 million the amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income apss next claim pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement was submitted to the doe on october 31 2018 in the amount of 102 million apss share is 3 million this claim is pending doe review 

the onemill fee — in 2011 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners and the nuclear energy institute challenged the doe’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent 

table of contents 

per kwh fee the “onemill fee” paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the standard contract this fee is recovered by aps in its retail rates in june 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” held that the doe failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination the dc circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the secretary of the doe “secretary” with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months in february 2013 upon completion of the doe’s revised onemill fee adequacy determination the dc circuit reopened the proceedings on november 19 2013 the dc circuit found that the doe did not conduct a legally adequate fee assessment and ordered the secretary to notify congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators as he is required to do pursuant to the nwpa and the dc circuit’s order on january 3 2014 the secretary notified congress of his intention to suspend collection of the onemill fee subject to congress’ disapproval on may 16 2014 the doe notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators who are party to a standard contract that it reduced the onemill fee to zero thus effectively terminating the onemill fee 

  

doe’s construction authorization application for yucca mountain — the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several interested parties have also intervened in the nrc proceeding additionally a number of interested parties filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application and the nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application the cases have been consolidated into one matter at the dc circuit in august 2013 the dc circuit ordered the nrc to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds 

on october 16 2014 the nrc issued volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure and its issuance is a key milestone in the yucca mountain licensing process volume 3 contains the staff’s finding that the doe’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed including but not limited to the postclosure performance objectives in nrc regulations 

on december 18 2014 the nrc issued volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository it documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the doe’s research and development and performance confirmation programs as well as other administrative controls and systems meet applicable nrc requirements volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in nrc regulations are met except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights 

publication of volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository 

  

waste confidence and continued storage — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

table of contents 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with nepa requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision the nrc commissioners also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of september 6 2012 

in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel renamed as the continued storage rule the nrc’s decision adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses although palo verde had not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the dc circuit’s june 8 2012 decision the nrc lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the dc circuit issued its june 2012 decision the final continued storage rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals in june 2016 the dc circuit issued its final decision rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the continued storage rule on august 8 2016 the dc circuit denied a petition for rehearing 

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility we are on track to meet the current site specific decommissioning costs for palo verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned see note 19 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near palo verde ocotillo located in tempe discussed below sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at yucca run on either gas or oil aps has two oilonly power plants fairview located in the town of douglas arizona and yucca gt4 in yuma az aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oilonly combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3179 mw gas for these plants is financially hedged up to five years in advance of purchasing and the gas is generally purchased one month prior to delivery aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered by truck directly to the power plants 

ocotillo was originally a 330 mw 4unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw see note 3 for rate recovery as part of the acc final written opinion and order issued reflecting its decision in aps’s general retail rate case the 2017 rate case decision on september 9 2016 maricopa county issued a final permit decision that authorizes construction of the ocotillo modernization project and construction began in early 2017 with completion targeted by the middle of 2019 

solar facilities 

aps developed utility scale solar resources through the 170 mw accapproved az sun program investing approximately 675 million in this program these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona in addition to the az sun program aps developed the 40 mw red rock solar plant which it owns and operates two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from aps that are equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that red rock is projected to generate 

  

aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar systems in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 was a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona the pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 rate case decision the participants have been transferred to the solar partner program described below additionally aps owns 12 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing an apsowned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid the first stage of the program called the solar partner program placed 8 mw of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as made systems available to limitedincome customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties the second stage of the program which included an additional 2 mw of rooftop solar and energy storage placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 mw on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various gridrelated operation improvements and system

in the 2017 rate case decision the acc also approved the aps solar communities program aps solar communities is a threeyear program authorizing aps to spend 10 million  15 million in capital costs each year to install utilityowned distributed generation systems on low to moderate income residential homes buildings of nonprofit entities title i schools and rural government facilities the 2017 rate case decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses property taxes marketing and advertising expenses and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the res 

energy storage 

aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage storage can provide capacity improve power quality be utilized for system regulation integrate renewable generation and can be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments battery storage can also aid in integrating higher levels of renewables by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale battery storage projects to evaluate the potential benefits for customers and further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid we are preparing for additional battery storage in the future 

in early 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under this agreement is scheduled to begin in 2021 aps issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 mw of battery storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon our evaluation of the rfp responses aps has decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site in february 2019 we contracted for the 141 mw and anticipate such facilities could be in service by mid2020 additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year power purchase agreements for energy storage totaling 150 mw service under these agreements are scheduled to begin in 2021 we plan to install at least an additional 660 mw of apsowned solar plus battery storage and standalone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025 with the first 260 mw being procured in 2019 60 mw on additional az sun sites and 100 mw of solar plus 100 mw of battery storage 

purchased power contracts 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 16 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability in addition aps has also entered into several power purchase agreements for energy storage see business of arizona public service company  energy sources and resource planning  energy storage above for details of our energy storage power purchase agreements

energy imbalance market 

in 2015 aps and the caiso the operator for the majority of californias transmission grid signed an agreement for aps to begin participation in the energy imbalance market “eim” apss participation in the eim began on october 1 2016 the eim allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15minute blocks with dispatching every five minutes before the energy is needed instead of the traditional one hour blocks aps continues to expect that its participation in eim will lower its fuel costs improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources 

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 9 of retail electric sales in 2019 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 general retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to use its best efforts to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment in 2015 

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 9 in 2019 on june 29 2018 aps filed its 2019 res implementation plan and requested a permanent waiver of the residential distributed energy requirement for 2019 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

  



on april 21 2015 the res rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy the rules allow the acc to consider such information in determining whether aps has satisfied the requirements of the res see clean resource energy standard and tariff in note 3 for information regarding an additional renewable energy standards proposal

demand side management 

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed ees of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates see note 3 for information regarding accs regulation of apss retail electric rates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another in february of 2015 

on november 17 2018 the acc voted 50 to again reexamine retail competition a special open meeting workshop was held on december 3 2018 no substantive action was taken but interested parties were asked to submit written comments and respond to a list of questions from acc staff those comments and responses are still being submitted the acc is planning at least one more workshop on the issue in 2019 aps cannot predict whether these efforts will result in any changes

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2018 approximately 47 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

subpoena from arizona corporation commissioner robert burns 

on august 25 2016 commissioner burns individually and not by action of the acc as a whole served subpoenas in aps’s then current retail rate proceeding on aps and pinnacle west for the production of records and information relating to a range of expenditures from 2011 through 2016 the subpoenas requested information concerning marketing and advertising expenditures charitable donations lobbying expenses contributions to 501c3 and c4 nonprofits and political contributions the return date for the production of information was set as september 15 2016 the subpoenas also sought testimony from company personnel having knowledge of the material including the chief executive officer 

on september 9 2016 aps filed with the acc a motion to quash the subpoenas or alternatively to stay apss obligations to comply with the subpoenas and decline to decide apss motion pending court proceedings contemporaneously with the filing of this motion aps and pinnacle west filed a complaint for special action and declaratory judgment in the superior court of arizona for maricopa county seeking a declaratory judgment that commissioner burns’ subpoenas are contrary to law on september 15 2016 aps produced all nonconfidential and responsive documents and offered to produce any remaining responsive documents that are confidential after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is signed 

on february 7 2017 commissioner burns opened a new acc docket and indicated that its purpose is to study and rectify problems with transparency and disclosure regarding financial contributions from regulated monopolies or other stakeholders who may appear before the acc that may directly or indirectly benefit an acc commissioner a candidate for acc commissioner or key acc staff as part of this docket commissioner burns set march 24 2017 as a deadline for the production of all information previously requested through the subpoenas neither aps nor pinnacle west produced the information requested and instead objected to the subpoena on march 10 2017 commissioner burns filed suit against aps and pinnacle west in the superior court of arizona for maricopa county in an effort to enforce his subpoenas on march 30 2017 aps filed a motion to dismiss commissioner burns suit against aps and pinnacle west in response to the motion to dismiss the court stayed the suit and ordered commissioner burns to file a motion to compel the production of the information sought by the subpoenas with the acc on june 20 2017 the acc denied the motion to compel 

on august 4 2017 commissioner burns amended his complaint to add all of the acc commissioners and the acc itself as defendants all defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on february 15 2018 the superior court dismissed commissioner burns’ amended complaint on march 6 2018 commissioner burns filed an objection to the proposed final order from the superior court and a motion to further amend his complaint the superior court permitted commissioner burns to amend his complaint to add a claim regarding his attempted investigation into whether his fellow commissioners should have been disqualified from voting on aps’s 2017 rate case commissioner burns filed his second amended complaint and all defendants filed responses opposing the second amended complaint and requested that it be dismissed

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative initiatives there have been no recent successful attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions and it is unclear at this time whether the 116 th congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is written and enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona at this time the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review nsr analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 2 2014 epa issued two proposed rules to regulate ghg emissions from modified and reconstructed electric generating units egus pursuant to section 111b of the clean air act and existing fossil fuelfired power plants pursuant to clean air act section 111d on august 3 2015 epa finalized carbon pollution standards for egus the clean power plan on october 10 2017 epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and proposed replacement regulations on august 21 2018 in addition judicial challenges to the clean power plan are pending before the dc circuit though that litigation is currently in abeyance while epa develops regulatory action to potentially repeal and replace that regulation 

epas pending proposal to regulate carbon emissions from egus replaces the clean power plan with standards that are based entirely upon measures that can be implemented to improve the heat rate of steamelectric power plants specifically coalfired egus in contrast with the clean power plan epas proposed affordable clean energy rule would not involve utilitylevel generation dispatch shifting away from coalfired generation and toward renewable energy resources and natural gasfired combined cycle power plants in 

table of contents 

addition to address the nsr implications of power plant upgrades potentially necessary to achieve compliance with the proposed affordable clean energy rule standards epa also proposed to revise epas nsr regulations to more readily authorize the implementation of egu efficiency upgrades 

we cannot predict the outcome of epas regulatory actions related to the august 2015 carbon pollution standards for egus including any actions related to epas repeal proposal for the clean power plan or additional rulemaking actions to approve the epas recently proposed affordable clean energy rule in addition we cannot predict whether the dc circuit court will continue to hold the litigation challenging the original clean power plan in abeyance in light of epas repeal proposal which is still pending

aps prepares an annual inventory of ghg emissions from its operations for apss operations involving fossilfuel electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution apss annual ghg inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program aps also voluntarily tracks and reports the fullscope of the companys ghg emissions arising from all aps operations in addition to ghg emissions from generation and transmission and distribution operations this data includes all other ghg emissions arising from ancillary company operations such as vehicle use employee travel portable generators and facility energy usage this data is then voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report 

  

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules  in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

cholla aps believed that epa’s original 2012 final rule establishing controls constituting bart for cholla which would require installation of selective catalytic reduction scr controls was unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s state implementation plan sip and promulgating a federal implementation plan fip that was inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program in september 2014 aps met with epa to propose a compromise bart strategy whereby aps would permanently close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset aps made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment is unlikely to be required in the future because retiring andor converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more cost effective than and will result in increased visibility improvement over the bart requirements for oxides of nitrogen nox imposed through epas bart fip in early 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating apss compromise proposal which took effect for cholla on april 26 2017

coal combustion waste on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent’s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity such closure requirements are deemed forced closure or closure for cause of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below 

on december 16 2016 president obama signed the water infrastructure improvements for the nation wiin act into law which contains a number of provisions requiring epa to modify the selfimplementing provisions of the agencys current ccr rules under subtitle d such modifications include new epa authority to directly enforce the ccr rules through the use of administrative orders and providing states like arizona where the cholla facility is located the option of developing ccr disposal unit permitting programs subject to epa approval for facilities in states that do not develop statespecific permitting programs epa is required to develop a federal permit program pending the availability of congressional appropriations by contrast for facilities located within the boundaries of native american tribal reservations such as the navajo nation where the navajo plant and four corners facilities are located epa is required to develop a federal permit program regardless of appropriated funds 

adeq has initiated a process to evaluate how to develop a state ccr permitting program that would cover egus including cholla while aps has been working with adeq on the development of this program we are unable to predict when arizona will be able to finalize and secure epa approval for a statespecific ccr permitting program with respect to the navajo nation aps has sought clarification as to when and how epa would be initiating permit proceedings for facilities on the reservation including four corners we are unable to predict at this time when epa will be issuing ccr management permits for the facilities on the navajo nation at this time it remains unclear how the ccr provisions of the wiin act will affect aps and its management of ccr 

based upon utility industry petitions for epa to reconsider the rcra subtitle d regulations for ccr which were premised in part on the ccr provisions of the 2016 wiin act on september 13 2017 epa 

table of contents 

agreed to evaluate whether to revise these federal ccr regulations on july 17 2018 epa finalized a revision to its rcra subtitle d regulations for ccr the phase i part i revision to its ccr regulations deferring for future action a number of other proposed changes contemplated in a march 1 2018 proposal for the final rule issued on july 17 2018 epa established nationwide healthbased standards for certain constituents of ccr subject to groundwater corrective action and delayed the closure deadlines for certain unlined ccr surface impoundments by 18 months for example those disposal units required to undergo forced closure these changes to the federal regulations governing ccr disposal are unlikely to have a material impact on aps as for those aspects of the march 2018 rulemaking proposal for which epa has yet to take final action it remains unclear which specific provisions of the federal ccr rules will ultimately be modified how they will be modified or when such modification will occur 

pursuant to a june 24 2016 order by the dc circuit court of appeals in the litigation by industry and environmentalgroups challenging epa’s ccr regulations epa is required to complete a rulemaking proceeding in the near future concerning whether or not boron must be included on the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action under epa’s ccr rules simultaneously with the issuance of epas proposed modifications to the federal ccr rules in response to industry petitions on march 1 2018 epa issued a proposed rule seeking comment as to whether or not boron should be included on this list epa is not required to take final action approving the inclusion of boron should epa take final action adding boron to the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action any resulting corrective action measures may increase apss costs of compliance with the ccr rule at our coalfired generating facilities at this time aps cannot predict the eventual results of this rulemaking proceeding concerning boron 

on august 21 2018 the dc circuit court issued its decision on the merits in this litigation the court upheld the legality of epa’s ccr regulations though it vacated and remanded back to epa a number of specific provisions which are to be corrected in accordance with the court’s order among the issues affecting aps’s management of ccr the dc circuit’s decision vacated and remanded those provisions of the epa ccr regulations that allow for the operation of unlined ccr surface impoundments even where those unlined impoundments have not otherwise violated a regulatory location restriction or groundwater protection standard ie otherwise triggering forced closure at this time it remains unclear how this dc circuit court decision will affect aps’s operations or financial results as epa has yet to take regulatory action on remand to revise its 2015 ccr regulations consistent with the court’s order 

based on this decision on december 17 2018 certain environmental groups filed an emergency motion with the dc circuit to either stay or summarily vacate epas july 17 2018 final rule extending the closureinitiation deadline for certain unlined ccr surface impoundments until october 2020 in response epa filed a motion to remand but not vacate that deadline extension regulation we cannot predict the outcome of the dc circuits consideration of these dueling motions and whether or how such a ruling would affect apss operations or financial results 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 22 million and its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for cholla is approximately 20 million the navajo plant currently disposes of ccr in a dry landfill storage area aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant is approximately 1 million additionally the ccr rule requires ongoing phased groundwater monitoring by october 17 2017 electric utility companies that own or operate ccr disposal units such as aps must have collected sufficient groundwater sampling data to initiate a detection monitoring program to the extent that certain threshold constituents are identified through this initial detection monitoring at levels above the ccr rule’s standards the rule required the initiation of an assessment monitoring program by april 15 2018 

table of contents 

aps recently completed the statistical analyses for its ccr disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring aps determined that several of its ccr disposal units at cholla and four corners will need to undergo corrective action in addition all such units must cease operating and initiate closure by october of 2020 aps currently estimates that the additional incremental costs to complete this corrective action and closure work along with the costs to develop replacement ccr disposal capacity could be approximately 5 million for both cholla and four corners aps initiated an assessment of corrective measures on january 14 2019 and anticipates completing this assessment during the summer of 2019 during this assessment aps will gather additional groundwater data solicit input from the public host public hearings and select remedies as such this 5 million cost estimate may change based upon aps’s performance of the ccr rule’s corrective action assessment process given uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment process we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to the company however at this time we do not believe any potential change to the cost estimate would have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

effluent limitation guidelines on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate 

on august 11 2017 epa announced that it would be initiating rulemaking proceedings to potentially revise the september 2015 effluent limitation guidelines on september 18 2017 epa finalized a regulation postponing the earliest date on which compliance with the effluent limitation guidelines for these wastestreams would be required from november 1 2018 until november 1 2020 until epa issues a proposal describing how it intends to change the effluent limitation guidelines for bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater it is unclear how epa’s reconsideration process will affect how the four corners plant manages these wastestreams we expect that compliance with these limitations will be required in connection with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes discharge permit renewals aps anticipates that in connection with epas current reconsideration of the npdes permit for four corners see four corners national pollutant discharge elimination system permit below epa will propose a compliance deadline for the effluent limitation guidelines governing bottom ash transport water during march of 2019 until epa proposes a new npdes permit reissuance for four corners it is unclear what date epa will assign as a compliance deadline for four corners cholla and the navajo plant do not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” at a level of 70 parts per billion “ppb” with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nox and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 while epa took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on november 6 2017 the agencys final action designating nonattainment areas was not issued until april 30 2018 at that time epa designated the geographic areas containing yuma and phoenix arizona as in nonattainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone naaqs the vast majority of apss natural gasfired egus are located in these jurisdictions areas of arizona and the navajo nation where the remainder of apss fossilfuel fired egu fleet is located were designated as in attainment we anticipate that revisions to the sips and fips implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard will be in place between 2020 and 2021 at this time because proposed sips and fips

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who released generated transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible prps prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs for ou3 based upon discussions between the ou3 working group parties and epa along with the results of recent technical analyses prepared by the ou3 working group to supplement the rifs aps anticipates finalizing the rifs in the summer or fall of 2019 we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 2 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district rid filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area on january 25 2015 adeq sent a letter to aps seeking information concerning the degree to which if any aps’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area aps responded to adeq on may 4 2015 on december 16 2016 two rid environmental and engineering contractors filed an ancillary lawsuit for recovery of costs against aps and the other defendants in the rid litigation that same day another rid service provider filed an additional ancillary cercla lawsuit against certain of the defendants in the main rid litigation but excluded aps and certain other parties as named defendants because the ancillary lawsuits concern past costs allegedly incurred by these rid vendors which were ruled unrecoverable directly by rid in november of 2016 the additional lawsuits do not increase apss exposure or risk related to these matters 

on april 5 2018 rid and the defendants in that particular litigation executed a settlement agreement fully resolving rids cercla claims concerning both past and future cost recovery apss share of this settlement was immaterial in addition the two environmental and engineering vendors voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against aps and the other named defendants without prejudice an order to this effect was entered on april 17 2018 with this disposition of the case the vendors may file their lawsuit again in the future in addition aps and certain other parties not named in the remaining rid service provider lawsuit may be brought into the litigation via thirdparty complaints filed by the current direct defendants we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters however we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant sites certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

federal agency environmental lawsuit related to four corners 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both esa and nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the four corners power plant and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 

on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity on september 11 2017 the arizona district court issued an order granting ntecs motion dismissing the litigation with prejudice and terminating the proceedings on november 9 2017 the environmental group plaintiffs appealed the district court order dismissing their lawsuit oral arguments in this appeal will be heard in march 2019 we cannot predict whether this appeal will be successful and if it is successful the outcome of further district court proceedings 

four corners national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit 

on july 16 2018 several environmental groups filed a petition for review before the epa environmental appeals board eab concerning the npdes wastewater discharge permit for four corners which was reissued on june 12 2018 the environmental groups allege that the permit was reissued in contravention of several requirements under the clean water act and did not contain required provisions concerning epa’s 2015 revised effluent limitation guidelines for steamelectric egus 2014 existingsource regulations governing coolingwater intake structures and effluent limits for surface seepage and subsurface discharges from coalash disposal facilities to address certain of these issues through a reconsidered permit epa took action on december 19 2018 to withdraw the npdes permit reissued in june 2018 withdrawal of the permit moots the eab appeal and epa filed a motion to dismiss on that basis epa indicated that it anticipates proposing a replacement npdes permit by march 2019 and depending on the extent of public comments concerning that proposal taking final action on a new npdes permit by june 2019 at this time we cannot predict the outcome of epas reconsideration of the npdes permit and whether reconsideration will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under rights of way granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

table of contents 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its operating needs the four corners region in which four corners is located has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area however during the past 12 months the region has received snowfall and precipitation sufficient to recover the navajo reservoir to an optimum operating level reducing the probability of shortage in future years although the watershed and reservoirs are in a good condition at this time aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations 

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons including a number of gasfired power plants located within maricopa and pinal counties in november 1999 

table of contents 

the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

at this time the lower court proceedings in the gila river adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the gila river should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction a hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in march of 2018 in front of a special master and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on may 17 2018 the decision of the special master which was finalized on november 14 2018 but which is subject to further review by the trial court judge accepts the proposed hydrogeologic testing protocols supported by aps and other industrial users of groundwater upon a final decision by the trial court judge in this matter further proceedings thereafter will be dedicated to determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations the determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings will ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties such as aps that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations at this time aps cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

little colorado river adjudication aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court on december 20 2018 the court issued a case management order governing future proceedings in the adjudication whereby discovery is currently scheduled to close in december 2019 and a trial will be held in june 2020 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances 

table of contents 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state and local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties approximately 12 million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities including palo verde in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases water quality discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government 

table of contents 

enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

coal ash in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and in a dry landfill storage area at the navajo plant to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal in addition the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from ccr disposal units or the presence of ccr constituents within groundwater near ccr disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds 

ozone national ambient air quality standards in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides which set new more stringent standards intended to protect human health and human welfare depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas 

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

aps faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

potential financial risks  greenhouse gas regulation the clean power plan and potential litigation in 2015 epa finalized a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates could result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company epa took action in october 2017 to repeal these regulations and in august 2018 epa proposed the affordable clean energy rule to replace the clean power plan with a new set of regulations 

table of contents 

depending on the final outcome of a pending judicial review of the clean power plan along with related regulatory activity to repeal or replace these regulations the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative ghg emission limitations from power plants alternative ghg emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant ghg emissions 

physical and operational risks weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

coowners of our jointly owned generation facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation regulations economic conditions or changes in our industry which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities 

aps owns certain of our power plants jointly with other owners with varying ownership interests in such facilities changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources fuel costs legislation and regulation together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities could result in unaligned positions among coowners such differences in the coowners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could ultimately lead to disagreements among the parties as to how and whether to continue operation of such plants which could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets see note 3 for a discussion of the coowners plans to cease operations of the navajo plant and the related risks associated with apss continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers this is in large part due to a 2004 arizona court of appeals decision that found critical components of the accs rules to be violative of the arizona constitution the ruling also voided the operating authority of all the competitive providers previously authorized by the acc on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

one of these options would be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generationx program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buy 

table of contents 

through arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation the agx program was approved by the acc as part of the 2017 settlement agreement 

  

in november 2018 the acc voted to again reexamine retail competition interested parties were asked to submit written comments which are still being submitted in addition proposals to enable or support retail electric competition may be made from time to time through ballot initiatives legislative action or other forums in arizona the acc held one workshop on retail competition in december 2018 and is planning at least one more workshop on the issue in 2019 we cannot predict future regulatory or legislative action that might result in increased competition 

proposals to change policy in arizona or other states made through ballot initiatives or referenda may increase the company’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

in arizona and other states a person or organization may file a ballot initiative or referendum with the arizona secretary of state or other applicable state agency and if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are presented the initiative or referendum may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter ballot initiatives and referenda may relate to any matter including policy and regulation related to the electric industry and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact arizona utility customers the arizona economy and the company some ballot initiatives and referenda are drafted in an unclear manner and their potential industry and economic impact can be subject to varied and conflicting interpretations we may oppose certain initiatives or referenda including those that could result in negative impacts to our customers the state or the company via the electoral process litigation traditional legislative mechanisms agency rulemaking or otherwise which could result in significant costs to the company the passage of certain initiatives or referenda could result in laws and regulations that impact our business plans and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy resources   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 cumulative annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the lfcr is designed to address these matters 

  

table of contents 

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs 

in addition to these rules and requirements energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in apss service territory increased 17 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with the prior year for the three years 2016 through 2018 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 16 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15  25 for 2019 and to average in the range of 15  25 for 2019 through 2021 based on our assessment of improving economic conditions in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 01 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer growth were offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2016 through 2018 annual retail electricity sales were about flat adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 10  20 for 2019 and increase on average in the range of 15  25 during 2019 through 2021 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed renewable generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if we experience acceleration of expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives we may be unable to reach our estimated sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others concerns over physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other 

table of contents 

deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  

the impact of wildfires could negatively affect apss results of operations 

wildfires have the potential to affect the communities that aps serves and apss vast network of electric transmission lines and facilities the potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather impacts existing in arizona as those that led to the recent wildfires in northern california while we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets given apss expansive service territory wildfire risk is always present aps could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires that were caused by or enhanced due to apss negligence the arizona liability standard is different from that of california which generally imposes liability for resulting damages without regard to fault any damage caused to our assets loss of service to our customers or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact apss financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including those related to financing siting permitting new and evolving technology and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in expressing concerns about the environmental and climaterelated impacts from continued extraction transportation delivery and combustion of fossil fuels environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of fossil fuel infrastructure projects these efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables including the future course of federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities aps cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

we are subject to cybersecurity risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems 

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information there appears to be an increasing level of activity sophistication and maturity of threat actors in particular nation state actors that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the us bulk power transmission and distribution system our information technology systems generation including our palo verde nuclear facility transmission and distribution facilities and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of unauthorized access and are critical areas of cyber protection for us 

despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could i experience property damage disruptions to our business theft of or unauthorized access to customer employee financial or system operation information or other information ii experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair remediation and breach notification and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants the increasing promulgation of nerc and nrc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as those promulgated by nerc and the nrc or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties 

the risk of these systemrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems to date we have not experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations however as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency we may be unable to prevent all such attacks from being successful in the future 

we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants and portions of certain aps transmission lines are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 1201 million but not more than 179 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power reactor in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

table of contents 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation and increase the complexity of managing apss information technology and power system operations which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment the implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems which could require additional infrastructure and resources widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s traditional business model 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make apss existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like many companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 30 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2020 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit train and develop new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

table of contents 

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy financial regulation or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

table of contents 

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic social and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise while most of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions have been implemented changes to or repeal of that act and pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

table of contents 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 



table of contents 

   

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2019 plan aps projects it will develop 15 miles of new transmission lines over the next ten years one significant project the palo verde to morgan project recently completed all phases and is a new 500kv path that spans from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminates at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the palo verde to morgan project includes palo verdedelaneysun valleymorganpinnacle peak the project consisted of four phases and the fourth phase morgan to sun valley 500kv was energized in april of 2018 in total the project consisted of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed with the capability to string a 230kv line as a second circuit 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which have been completed and were included in previous aps transmission plans are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california the north gila to hassayampa line went into service in may 2015 and the delaney to palo verde line went into service in may 2016

plant and transmission line leases and rightsofway on indian lands 

  

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under rightsofway from the federal government the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo 

table of contents 

nation agreed that the navajo plant will remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that will allow for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceases operations in december 2019 various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives the plants coal supplier and the doi have been meeting to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 although we cannot predict whether any alternate plans will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement we believe it is probable that the current owners of the navajo plant will cease plant operations in december 2019 

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to the four corners facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 see areas of business focus  operational performance reliability and recent developments  four corners  lease extension in item 7 for additional information about the four corners rightofway and lease matters

the 2016 coal supply agreement contained alternate pricing terms for the 7 interest in the event ntec did not purchase the interest until the time that ntec purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions were applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms included a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales such payments are due to 4ca at the end of each calendar year a 10 million payment was due to 4ca at december 31 2017 which ntec satisfied by directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of a portion of a future mine reclamation obligation the balance of the amount due under this formula at december 31 2018 for calendar year 2017 was approximately 20 million which was paid to 4ca on december 14 2018 the balance of the amount under this formula for calendar year 2018 up to the date that ntec purchased the 7 interest is approximately 10 million which is due to 4ca at december 31 2019 

lease extension   aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the esa and nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the four corners power plant and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016

navajo plant 

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant will remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that will allow for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceases operations in december 2019 various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives the plants coal supplier and doi have been meeting to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 although we cannot predict whether any alternate plans will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement we believe it is probable that the current owners of the navajo plant will cease plant operations in december 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and may be material

energy imbalance market in 2015 aps and the caiso the operator for the majority of californias transmission grid signed an agreement for aps to begin participation in eim apss participation 

table of contents 

in the eim began on october 1 2016 the eim allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15minute blocks with dispatching every five minutes before the energy is needed instead of the traditional one hour blocks aps continues to expect that its participation in eim will lower its fuel costs improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources 

energy storage aps deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system including energy storage storage can provide capacity improve power quality be utilized for system regulation integrate renewable generation and can be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments battery storage can also aid in integrating higher levels of renewables by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset aps is utilizing gridscale battery storage projects to evaluate the potential benefits for customers and further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid we are preparing for additional battery storage in the future 

in early 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under this agreement is scheduled to begin in 2021 aps issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 mw of battery storage to be located at up to five of its az sun sites based upon our evaluation of the rfp responses aps has decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 mw by adding a sixth az sun site in february 2019 we contracted for the 141 mw and anticipate such facilities could be in service by mid2020 additionally in february 2019 aps signed two 20year power purchase agreements for energy storage totaling 150 mw service under these agreements are scheduled to begin in 2021 we plan to install at least an additional 660 mw of apsowned solar plus battery storage and standalone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025 with the first 260 mw being procured in 2019 60 mw on additional az sun sites and 100 mw of solar plus 100 mw of battery storage

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

operating revenues   for the years 2016 through 2018 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 95 of our total operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 17 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with the prior year for the three years 2016 through 2018 aps’s customer growth averaged 16 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 15  25 for 2019 and to average in the range of 15  25 for 2019 through 2021 based on our assessment of improving economic conditions in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 01 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer growth were offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2016 through 2018 annual retail electricity sales were about flat adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 10  20 for 2019 and increase on average in the range of 15  25 during 2019 through 2021 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in dg and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors

under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to approximately 15 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation unplanned outages planned outages typically scheduled in the spring and fall renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors see note 2 for discussion of new accounting guidance related to the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see liquidity and capital resources below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities and income tax impacts related to bonus depreciation 

  

pension and other postretirement nonservice credits  net    pension and other postretirement nonservice credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costscredit the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary see note 2 for discussion of new accounting guidance related to the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 110 of the assessed value for 2018 112 for 2017 and 2016 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units and transmission and distribution facilities 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted and was generally effective on january 1 2018 changes which will impact the company include a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utilities and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized see note 4 for details of the impacts on the company as of december 31 2018 in apss recent general retail rate case the acc approved a tax expense

adjustor mechanism which will be used to pass through the income tax effects to retail customers of the tax act see note 3 for details of the team 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40  as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2018 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 54  its total shareholder equity was approximately 57 billion  and total capitalization was approximately 105 billion  under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 42 billion  

table of contents 

assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2018  the ratio was approximately 50 for pinnacle west and 46 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of crossdefault provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

table of contents 

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings except for pension benefits which would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings we had 1510 million of regulatory assets and 2492 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2018 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

on january 1 2018 we adopted new accounting standard asu 201707 compensationretirement benefits improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost this new standard changed our income statement presentation of net periodic benefit cost and allows only the service cost component of periodic net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization see note 2 for additional information

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2018 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2018 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

table of contents 

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments held in our other special use funds certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures 

asset retirement obligations 

we recognize an aro for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible longlived assets for which a legal obligation exists the aro liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets aro measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability we use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an aro this approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes the scenarios consider settlement of the aro at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected decommissioning dates the fair value of an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the longlived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets in addition we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded aro for these assets in accordance with gaap accounting aps accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets even if there is no legal obligation for removal 

aros as of december 31 2018 are described further in note 11 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted and is generally effective january 1 2018 this legislation made significant changes to the federal income tax laws changes which impact the company include but are not limited to a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utility property and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized 

deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the change is enacted given the regulatory nature of the company’s business substantially all of the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities for the reduction in the federal corporate tax 

table of contents 

rate to 21 was recorded as a regulatory liability recoverable by ratepayers as of december 31 2017 see note 3 for further discussion of the accounting for the regulatory liability 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with the application of complex laws and regulations which are voluminous and often ambiguous interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time tax positions taken by pinnacle west on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold assuming that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes on the basis of the technical merits additional guidance may be issued through legislation treasury regulations or other technical guidance which may materially affect amounts the company has recognized in its financial statements 

we record unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions that may not satisfy this more likely than not recognition threshold as liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these liabilities are adjusted when management judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available these changes will be reflected as an increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available

coalfueled generating facilities 

  

four corners  — four corners is located in the northwestern corner of new mexico and was originally a 5unit coalfired power plant aps owns 100 of units 1 2 and 3 which were retired as of december 30 2013 aps operates the plant and owns 63 of four corners units 4 and 5 following the acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 described below aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 970 mw additionally 4ca a whollyowned subsidiary of pinnacle west owns 7 of units 4 and 5 following its acquisition of el pasos interest in these units described below 

  

on december 30 2013 aps purchased sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million in connection with aps’s prior general retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis this decision was appealed and on september 26 2017 the court of appeals affirmed the accs decision on the four corners rate adjustment

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that served four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton was retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator through 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 the 2016 coal supply agreement el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation see note 10 for a discussion of a pending arbitration related to the 2016 coal supply agreement on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

ntec had the option to purchase the 7 interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the purchase did not occur during the originally contemplated timeframe the parties are currently in discussions as to the future of the option transaction 

the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest at this time since ntec has not yet purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions are applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms include a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales such payments are due to 4ca at the end of each calendar year a 10 million payment was due to 4ca at december 31 2017 which ntec satisfied by directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of a portion of a future mine reclamation obligation the balance of the amount under this formula at december 31 2017 is approximately 20 million which is due to 4ca at december 31 2018 in future years there may be similar payments due from ntec to 4ca under this formula 4ca believes ntec should continue to satisfy its contractual obligations related to these payments however if ntec fails to meet its contractual obligations when due 4ca will consider appropriate measures and potential impacts to the companys financial statements 

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the endangered species act esa and the national environmental policy act nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at four corners and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 

on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity on september 11 2017 the arizona district court issued an order granting ntecs motion dismissing the litigation with prejudice and terminating the proceedings on november 9 2017 the environmental group plaintiffs appealed the

aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 in addition aps has a coal transportation contract that runs through 2019 

  

navajo plant  — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in navajo units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2019 with extension rights through 2026 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant will remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that will allow for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceases operations in december 2019 various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives the plants coal supplier and doi have been meeting to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 although we cannot predict whether any alternate plans will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement we believe it is probable that the navajo plant will cease operations in 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and which may be material 

  

on february 14 2017 the acc opened a docket titled acc investigation concerning the future of the navajo generating station with the stated goal of engaging stakeholders and negotiating a sustainable pathway for the navajo plant to continue operating in some form after december 2019 aps cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal —  the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 aps is directly and indirectly involved in several legal proceedings related to doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract  — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a lawsuit against doe in the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims for damages incurred due to doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded 302 million in damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe in the court of federal claims this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to doe’s breach of the standard contract for failing to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the standard contract and the nwpa on august 18 2014 aps and doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment of 574 million by doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 aps’s share of this amount is 167 million amounts recovered in the lawsuit and settlement were recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on the amount of reported net income in addition the settlement agreement provides aps with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through december 31 2016 which has been extended to december 31 2019 

aps has submitted three claims pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement for three separate time periods during july 1 2011 through june 30 2016 the doe has approved and paid 652 million for these claims aps’s share is 19 million the amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income apss next claim pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement was submitted to the doe in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the amount of 9 million apss share is 26 million in february 2018 the doe approved this claim 

the onemill fee  — in 2011 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners and the nuclear energy institute challenged doe’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kwh fee the “onemill fee” paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the standard contract this fee is recovered by aps in its retail rates in june 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” held that doe failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination the dc circuit remanded the

2010 determination to the secretary of the doe “secretary” with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months in february 2013 upon completion of doe’s revised onemill fee adequacy determination the dc circuit reopened the proceedings on november 19 2013 the dc circuit found that the doe did not conduct a legally adequate fee assessment and ordered the secretary to notify congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators as he is required to do pursuant to the nwpa and the dc circuit’s order on january 3 2014 the secretary notified congress of his intention to suspend collection of the onemill fee subject to congress’ disapproval on may 16 2014 the doe notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators who are party to a standard contract that it reduced the onemill fee to zero thus effectively terminating the onemill fee 

  

doe’s construction authorization application for yucca mountain  — the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several interested parties have also intervened in the nrc proceeding additionally a number of interested parties filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application and nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application the cases have been consolidated into one matter at the dc circuit in august 2013 the dc circuit ordered the nrc to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds 

on october 16 2014 the nrc issued volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure and its issuance is a key milestone in the yucca mountain licensing process volume 3 contains the staff’s finding that the doe’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed including but not limited to the postclosure performance objectives in nrc’s regulations 

on december 18 2014 the nrc issued volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository it documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the doe’s research and development and performance confirmation programs as well as other administrative controls and systems meet applicable nrc requirements volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in nrc regulations are met except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights 

publication of volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository 

  

waste confidence   and continued storage  — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s 2010 waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with nepa requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the

environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the 2010 waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision the nrc commissioners also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of september 6 2012 

in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel renamed as the continued storage rule the nrc’s decision adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses although palo verde had not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the dc circuit’s june 8 2012 decision the nrc lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the dc circuit issued its june 2012 decision the final continued storage rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals in june 2016 the dc circuit issued its final decision rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the continued storage rule on august 8 2016 the dc circuit denied a petition for rehearing 

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs  — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility we are on track to meet the current site specific decommissioning costs for palo verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned see note 19 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts

ocotillo is a 330 mw 4unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw with completion targeted by summer 2019 see note 3 for rate recovery as part of the 2017 rate case decision on september 9 2016 maricopa county issued a final permit decision that authorizes construction of the ocotillo modernization project and construction began in early 2017 

  

solar facilities 

aps developed utility scale solar resources through the 170 mw accapproved az sun program aps invested approximately 675 million in its az sun program these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona in addition to the az sun program aps developed the 40mw red rock solar plant which it owns and operates two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from aps that is equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that red rock is projected to generate 

  

aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 was a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona the pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 rate case decision the participants have been transferred to the solar partner program described below additionally aps owns 12 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing an apsowned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid the first stage of the program called the solar partner program placed 8 mw of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as made systems available to limitedincome customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties the second stage of the program which included an additional 2 mw of rooftop solar and energy storage placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 mw on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various gridrelated operation improvements and system interoperability and was in operation by the end of 2016 the costs for this program have been included in apss rate base as part of the 2017 rate case decision 

in apss 2017 rate case decision the acc approved the aps solar communities program aps solar communities is a threeyear program requiring aps to spend 1015 million in capital costs each year to install utilityowned distributed generation systems on low to moderate income residential homes buildings of nonprofit entities title i schools and rural government facilities the 2017 rate case decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses property taxes marketing and advertising expenses and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the res

energy imbalance market 

in 2015 aps and the caiso the operator for the majority of californias transmission grid signed an agreement for aps to begin participation in the energy imbalance market “eim” apss participation in the eim began on october 1 2016 the eim allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15minute blocks with dispatching every five minutes before the energy is needed instead of the traditional one hour blocks aps expects that its participation in eim will lower its fuel costs improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources 

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 8 of retail electric sales in 2018 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 general retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to use its best efforts to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment and overall res target for 2017 

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 8 in 2018 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

  



on april 21 2015 the res rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy the rules allow the acc to consider such information in determining whether aps has satisfied the requirements of the res see renewable energy ballot initiative and clean

additionally in early february 2018 aps entered into a 15year power purchase agreement for a 65 mw solar facility that charges a 50 mw solarfueled battery service under the agreement is scheduled to begin in 2021 

demand side management 

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed ees of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2017 approximately 38 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

subpoena from arizona corporation commissioner robert burns 

on august 25 2016 commissioner burns individually and not by action of the acc as a whole served subpoenas in aps’s then current retail rate proceeding on aps and pinnacle west for the production of records and information relating to a range of expenditures from 2011 through 2016 the subpoenas requested information concerning marketing and advertising expenditures charitable donations lobbying expenses contributions to 501c3 and c4 nonprofits and political contributions the return date for the production of information was set as september 15 2016 the subpoenas also sought testimony from company personnel having knowledge of the material including the chief executive officer 

on september 9 2016 aps filed with the acc a motion to quash the subpoenas or alternatively to stay apss obligations to comply with the subpoenas and decline to decide apss motion pending court proceedings contemporaneously with the filing of this motion aps and pinnacle west filed a complaint for special action and declaratory judgment in the superior court of arizona for maricopa county seeking a declaratory judgment that commissioner burns’ subpoenas are contrary to law on september 15 2016 aps produced all nonconfidential and responsive documents and offered to produce any remaining responsive documents that are confidential after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is signed 

on february 7 2017 commissioner burns opened a new acc docket and indicated that its purpose is to study and rectify problems with transparency and disclosure regarding financial contributions from regulated monopolies or other stakeholders who may appear before the acc that may directly or indirectly benefit an acc commissioner a candidate for acc commissioner or key acc staff as part of this docket commissioner burns set march 24 2017 as a deadline for the production of all information previously requested through the subpoenas neither aps nor pinnacle west produced the information requested and instead objected to the subpoena on march 10 2017 commissioner burns filed suit against aps and pinnacle west in the superior court of arizona for maricopa county in an effort to enforce his subpoenas on march 30 2017 aps filed a motion to dismiss commissioner burns suit against aps and pinnacle west in response to the motion to dismiss the court stayed the suit and ordered commissioner burns to file a motion to compel the production of the information sought by the subpoenas with the acc on june 20 2017 the acc denied the motion to compel on august 4 2017 commissioner burns amended his complaint to add all of the acc commissioners and the acc itself as defendants all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on february 15 2018 the superior court dismissed commissioner burns’ complaint the matter is subject to appeal aps and pinnacle west cannot predict the outcome of this matter

in addition to the superior court proceedings discussed above on august 20 2017 commissioner burns filed a special action petition in the arizona supreme court seeking to vacate the 2017 rate case decision so that alleged issues of disqualification and bias on the part of the other commissioners could be fully investigated aps opposed the petition and on october 17 2017 the arizona supreme court declined to accept jurisdiction over commissioner burns’ special action petition 

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative initiatives there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions and it is doubtful whether the 115 th  congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is written and enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives   in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review nsr analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 2 2014 epa issued two proposed rules to regulate ghg emissions from modified and reconstructed electric generating units egus pursuant to section 111b of the clean air act and existing fossil fuelfired power plants pursuant to clean air act section 111d 

on august 3 2015 epa finalized carbon pollution standards for egus shortly thereafter a coalition of states industry groups and electric utilities challenged the legality of these standards including epas clean power plan for existing egus in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit on february 9 2016 the us supreme court granted a stay of the clean power plan pending judicial review of the rule which temporarily delays compliance obligations under the clean power plan on march 28 2017 president trump issued an executive order that among other things instructs epa to reevaluate agency regulations concerning carbon emissions from egus and take appropriate action to suspend revise or rescind the august 2015 carbon pollution standards for egus including the clean power plan also on march 28 2017 doj on behalf of

epa filed a motion with the us court of appeals for the dc circuit court to hold the ongoing litigation over the clean power plan in abeyance pending epa action in accordance with the executive order at this time the dc circuit court proceedings evaluating the legality of the clean power plan remain on hold 

based upon epas reevaluation of the august 2015 carbon pollution standards and the legal basis for these regulations on october 10 2017 epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan that proposal relies on epas current view as to the agencys legal authority under clean air act section 111d which in contrast to the clean power plan would limit the scope of any future section 111d regulations to measures undertaken exclusively at a power plants source of ghg emissions on december 18 2017 epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking through which epa is soliciting comments as to potential replacements for the clean power plan that would be consistent with epas current legal interpretation of the clean air act 

we cannot predict the outcome of epas regulatory actions related to the august 2015 carbon pollution standards for egus including any actions related to epas repeal proposal for the clean power plan or additional rulemaking actions to develop regulations replacing the clean power plan in addition we cannot predict whether the dc circuit court will continue to hold the litigation challenging the original clean power plan in abeyance in light of epas repeal proposal 

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives that address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning  current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biogas and biomass 

aps prepares an annual inventory of ghg emissions from its operations this inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program and is voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report 

  

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules    in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

cholla aps believed that epa’s original 2012 final rule establishing controls constituting bart for cholla which would require installation of selective catalytic reduction scr controls was unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s state implementation plan sip and promulgating a federal implementation plan fip that was inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program in september 2014 aps met with epa to propose a compromise bart strategy aps would permanently close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset aps made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment is unlikely to be required in the future because retiring andor converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more cost effective than and will result

four corners  based on epa’s final standards apss 63 share of the cost of required controls for four corners units 4 and 5 is approximately 400 million see note 3 for information regarding the related rate recovery in addition aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el pasos 7 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 ntec has the option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec in december 2015 ntec notified aps of its intent to exercise the option the purchase did not occur during the originally contemplated timeframe the parties are currently in discussions as to the future of the option transaction the cost of the pollution controls related to the 7 interest is approximately 45 million which will be assumed by the ultimate owner of the 7 interest 

navajo plant  aps estimates that its share of costs for upgrades at the navajo plant based on epa’s fip could be up to approximately 200 million however given the future plans for the navajo plant we do not expect to incur these costs see energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities  navajo generating station above and navajo plant in note 3 for information regarding future plans for the navajo plant 

coal combustion waste  on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent’s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity 

while epa has chosen to regulate the disposal of ccr in landfills and surface impoundments as nonhazardous waste under the final rule the agency makes clear that it will continue to evaluate any risks associated with ccr disposal and leaves open the possibility that it may regulate ccr as a hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c in the future 

on december 16 2016 president obama signed the water infrastructure improvements for the nation wiin act into law which contains a number of provisions requiring epa to modify the selfimplementing provisions of the agencys current ccr rules under subtitle d such modifications include new epa authority to directly enforce the ccr rules through the use of administrative orders and providing states like arizona where the cholla facility is located the option of developing ccr disposal unit permitting programs subject to epa approval for facilities in states that do not develop statespecific permitting programs epa is required to develop a federal permit program pending the availability of congressional appropriations by contrast for facilities located within the boundaries of native american tribal reservations such as the navajo nation

where the navajo plant and four corners facilities are located epa is required to develop a federal permit program regardless of appropriated funds 

adeq has initiated a process to evaluate how to develop a state ccr permitting program that would cover egus including cholla while aps has been working with adeq on the development of this program we are unable to predict when arizona will be able to finalize and secure epa approval for a statespecific ccr permitting program with respect to the navajo nation aps recently filed a comment letter with epa seeking clarification as to when and how epa would be initiating permit proceedings for facilities on the reservation including four corners we are unable to predict at this time when epa will be issuing ccr management permits for the facilities on the navajo nation at this time it remains unclear how the ccr provisions of the wiin act will affect aps and its management of ccr 

based upon utility industry petitions for epa to reconsider the rcra subtitle d regulations for ccr which were premised in part on the ccr provisions of the 2016 wiin act on september 13 2017 epa agreed to evaluate whether to revise these federal ccr regulations at this time it is not clear whether epa will initiate further noticeandcomment rulemaking to revise the federal ccr rules nor is it clear what aspects of the federal ccr rules might be changed as a result of this process with respect to ongoing litigation initiated by industry and environmental groups challenging the legality of these federal ccr regulations on september 27 2017 the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit the court overseeing these judicial challenges ordered epa to file by november 15 2017 a list of federal regulatory provisions addressing ccr that are or likely will be revised through epa’s reconsideration proceedings while this filing identified certain provisions of the federal ccr regulations that epa intends to revise including allowances for riskbased groundwater protection standards for regulated ccr constituents for which no federal maximum contaminant level has been set it is not clear at this time which specific provisions of the federal ccr rules will be modified how they will be modified or when such modification will occur 

pursuant to a june 24 2016 order by the dc circuit court of appeals in the litigation by industry and environmental groups challenging epa’s ccr regulations within the next two years epa is required to complete a rulemaking proceeding concerning whether or not boron must be included on the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action under epa’s ccr rules epa is not required to take final action approving the inclusion of boron but epa must propose and consider its inclusion should epa take final action adding boron to the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action any resulting corrective action measures may increase apss costs of compliance with the ccr rule at our coalfired generating facilities at this time aps cannot predict when epa will commence its rulemaking concerning boron or the eventual results of those proceedings 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 22 million and its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for cholla is approximately 20 million the navajo plant currently disposes of ccr in a dry landfill storage area aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant is approximately 1 million additionally the ccr rule requires ongoing phased groundwater monitoring by october 17 2017 electric utility companies that own or operate ccr disposal units such as aps must have collected sufficient groundwater sampling data to initiate a detection monitoring program to the extent that certain threshold constituents are identified through this initial detection monitoring at levels above the ccr rule’s standards the rule requires the initiation of an assessment monitoring program by april 15 2018 if this assessment monitoring program reveals concentrations of certain constituents above the ccr rule standards that trigger remedial obligations a corrective measures evaluation must be completed by january 2019 depending upon the results of such groundwater monitoring and data evaluations at each of cholla four corners and the

effluent limitation guidelines   on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate 

on august 11 2017 epa announced that it would be initiating rulemaking proceedings to potentially revise the september 2015 effluent limitation guidelines on september 18 2017 epa finalized a regulation postponing the earliest date on which compliance with the effluent limitation guidelines for these wastestreams would be required from november 1 2018 until november 1 2020 until epa issues a proposal describing how it intends to change the effluent limitation guidelines for bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater it is unclear how epa’s reconsideration process will affect how the four corners plant manages these wastestreams we expect that compliance with these limitations will be required in connection with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes discharge permit renewals until a draft npdes permit for four corners is proposed during the revised compliance timeframe ie from november 1 2020 through december 31 2023 we are uncertain what will be required to control these discharges in compliance with the revised finalized effluent limitations at that facility cholla and the navajo plant do not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” at a level of 70 parts per billion “ppb” with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 to date epa has only taken action to designate areas of the us that are in attainment with the 2015 naaqs for ozone epa’s failure to take action relative to nonattainment designations is currently subject to ongoing judicial review by certain states and environmental groups at this time it remains unclear when epa will ultimately make a complete designation of all attainment and nonattainment areas within the us depending on when epa approves attainment designations for the arizona and navajo nation jurisdictions in which our fossil generation units are located revisions to sips and fips respectively implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard are expected to be in place between 2020 and 2021 at this time because proposed sips and fips implementing the revised ozone naaqss have yet to be released aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting aps

federal agency environmental lawsuit related to four corners 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both esa and nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the four corners power plant and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 

on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity on september 11 2017 the arizona district court issued an order granting ntecs motion dismissing the litigation with prejudice and terminating the proceedings on november 9 2017 the environmental group plaintiffs appealed the district court order dismissing their lawsuit we cannot predict whether this appeal will be successful and if it is successful the outcome of further district court proceedings

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs the four corners region in which four corners is located has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area however during the past 12 months the region has received snowfall and precipitation sufficient to recover the navajo reservoir to an optimum operating level reducing the probability of shortage in future years although the watershed and reservoirs are in a good condition at this time aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations 

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four 

table of contents 

corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons including a number of gasfired power plants located within maricopa and pinal counties in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

at this time the lower court proceedings in the gila river adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the gila river should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction discovery as to this issue is ongoing at this time and a hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question will be held in march of 2018 further proceedings thereafter will be dedicated to determining the specific hydrogeologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations at this time aps cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

little colorado river adjudication   aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state and local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties approximately 12 million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other 

table of contents 

operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities including palo verde in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases water quality discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up  aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

coal ash   in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and in a dry landfill storage area at the navajo plant to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal 

ozone national ambient air quality standards   in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides which set new more stringent standards intended to protect human health and human welfare depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas    

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or 

table of contents 

legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

aps faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

potential financial risks  greenhouse gas regulation the clean power plan and potential litigation   in  2015 epa finalized a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates could result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company epa took action in october 2017 to potentially repeal these regulations and is currently taking public comments on whether or how epa could take action to replace the clean power plan with a new set of regulations 

depending on the final outcome of a pending judicial review of the clean power plan along with related regulatory activity to repeal or replace these regulations the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative ghg emission limitations from power plants alternative ghg emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant ghg emissions 

physical and operational risks    weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

coowners of our jointly owned generation facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation regulations economic conditions or changes in our industry which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities 

aps owns certain of our power plants jointly with other owners with varying ownership interests in such facilities changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources fuel costs legislation and regulation together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities could result in unaligned positions among coowners such differences in the coowners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could ultimately lead to disagreements among the parties as to how and whether to continue operation of such plants which could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets see note 3 for a discussion of the coowners plans to cease operations of the navajo plant and the related risks associated with apss continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

one of these options would be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generationx program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation the agx program was approved by the acc as part of the 2017 settlement agreement 

  

proposals to enable or support retail electric competition may be made from time to time through ballot initiatives legislative action or other forums in arizona we cannot predict future regulatory or legislative action that might result in increased competition 

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy resources   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 cumulative annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and 

table of contents 

the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the lfcr is designed to address these matters 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs 

in addition to these rules and requirements energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth  retail customers in apss service territory increased 18 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with the prior year for the three years 2015 through 2017 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 15 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 1525 for 2018 and to average in the range of 23 for 2018 through 2020 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations decreased 03 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer growth were more than offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency distributed renewable generation initiatives and one fewer day of sales due to the leap year in 2016 for the three years 2015 through 2017 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 0515 for 2018 and increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2018 through 2020 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed renewable generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if we experience acceleration of expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives we may be unable to reach our estimated sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others concerns over physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including those related to financing siting permitting new and evolving technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from the intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in expressing concerns about the environmental and climaterelated impacts from continued extraction transportation delivery and combustion of fossil fuels environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of fossil fuel infrastructure projects these efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables including the future course of federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities aps cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

we are subject to cybersecurity risks   and risks of unauthorized access to our systems 

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information there appears to be an increasing level of activity sophistication and maturity of threat actors in particular nation state actors that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the us bulk power transmission and distribution system our information technology systems generation including our palo verde nuclear facility transmission and distribution facilities and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of unauthorized access and are critical areas of cyber protection for us 

despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could i experience property damage disruptions to our business theft of or unauthorized access to customer employee financial or system operation information or other information ii experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair remediation and breach notification and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures; and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants the increasing promulgation of nerc and nrc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as those promulgated by nerc and the nrc or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties 

the risk of these systemrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems to date we have not experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations however as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency we may be unable to prevent all such attacks from being successful in the future 

we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants and portions of certain aps transmission lines are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 111 million but not more than 166 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

table of contents 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation and increase the complexity of managing apss information technology and power system operations which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment the implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems which could require additional infrastructure and resources widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s traditional business model 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make apss existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like many companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 30 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2020 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit train and develop new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy financial regulation or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

• causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

• increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

table of contents 

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic social and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise while most of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions have been implemented changes to that act or other potential legislation could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

table of contents 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 



table of contents 

   

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our financial results could be adversely affected if 4ca is unable to reach resolution with ntec regarding the future ownership of 4ca’s 7 interest in four corners and ntec is unwilling or unable to satisfy its contractual obligations 

on july 6 2016 4ca purchased el paso’s 7 interest in four corners ntec had the option to purchase the 7 interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the purchase did not occur during the originally contemplated timeframe the parties are currently in discussions as to the future of the option transaction 

the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 interest in the event ntec does not purchase the interest at this time since ntec has not yet purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions are applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms include a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales such payments are due to 4ca at the end of each calendar year a 10 million payment was due to 4ca at december 31 2017 which ntec satisfied by directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of a portion of a future mine reclamation obligation the balance of the amount under this formula at december 31 2017 is approximately 20 million which is due to 4ca at december 31 2018 in future years there may be similar payments due from ntec to 4ca under this formula 4ca believes ntec should continue to satisfy its contractual obligations related to these payments however if ntec fails to meet its contractual obligations when due 4ca will consider appropriate measures 

if ntec is unwilling or unable to ultimately assume ownership of the 7 interest of four corners on terms acceptable to 4ca and if ntec is unwilling or unable to satisfy its contractual obligations related to payments owed to 4ca under the 2016 coal supply agreement 4ca will consider potential impacts to the company’s financial statements which may negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 4ca and ntec are in active discussions regarding these matters and cannot predict the outcome of those discussions

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2018 plan aps projects it will develop 52 miles of new transmission lines over the next ten years one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the palo verde to morgan system includes palo verdedelaneysun valleymorganpinnacle peak the project consists of four phases the first three phases morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv palo verde to delaney 500kv and delaney to sun valley 500kv are currently inservice the fourth phase morgan to sun valley 500kv has started construction and is expected to be energized by may 2018 in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed with the capability to string a 230kv line as a second circuit 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which have been completed and were included in previous aps transmission plans are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california the north gila to hassayampa line went into service in may 2015 and the delaney to palo verde line went into service in may 2016 

physical security standards  on july 14 2015 ferc approved version 2 of the proposed physical security reliability standard cip014 it became effective on october 2 2015 and requires transmission owners and operators to protect those critical transmission stations and substations and their associated primary control centers that if rendered inoperable or damaged as a result of a physical attack could result in widespread instability uncontrolled separation or cascading within an interconnection as required by the physical security reliability standard aps determined its critical transmission stations and substations and associated primary control centers that were required to comply with the standard timely which triggered additional requirements and obligations within the physical security reliability standard these remaining obligations which consist of a risk evaluation and development and verification of a physical security plan were largely completed in 2016 with remaining activities projected to be complete in the first quarter of 2018 at this time significant financial or operational impacts on aps are not anticipated

of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a

on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close its 260 mw unit 2 at cholla and cease burning coal at the other apsowned units units 1 and 3 at the plant by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit which was later addressed in the 2017 settlement agreement see note 3 for details related to the resulting cost recovery aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the longterm than the benefits that would have resulted from adding emissions control equipment aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 in early 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating apss compromise proposal which took effect for cholla on april 26 2017 for additional information see business of arizona public service company  energy sources and resource planning  coalfueled generating facilities  cholla 

four corners 

  

asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters   on december 30 2013 aps purchased sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million in connection with aps’s prior general retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis this decision was appealed and on september 26 2017 the court of appeals affirmed the accs decision on the four corners rate adjustment 

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction described above bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that served four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed the 2016 coal supply agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation see note 10 for a discussion of a pending arbitration related to the 2016 coal supply agreement on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

ntec had the option to purchase the 7 interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the purchase did not occur during the originally contemplated timeframe the parties are currently in discussions as to the future of the option transaction 

the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest at this time since ntec has not yet purchased the 7 interest the alternate pricing provisions are applicable to 4ca as the holder of the 7 interest these terms include a formula under which ntec must make certain payments to 4ca for reimbursement of operations and maintenance costs and a specified rate of return offset by revenue generated by 4ca’s power sales such payments are due to 4ca at the end of each calendar year a 10 million payment was due to 4ca at december 31 2017 which ntec satisfied by directing to 4ca a prepayment from aps of a portion of a future mine reclamation obligation the balance of the amount under this formula at december 31 2017 is 

table of contents 

approximately 20 million which is due to 4ca at december 31 2018 in future years there may be similar payments due from ntec to 4ca under this formula 4ca believes ntec should continue to satisfy its contractual obligations related to these payments however if ntec fails to meet its contractual obligations when due 4ca will consider appropriate measures and potential impacts to the companys financial statements 

lease extension   aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the esa and nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the four corners power plant and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 

on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity on september 11 2017 the arizona district court issued an order granting ntecs motion dismissing the litigation with prejudice and terminating the proceedings on november 9 2017 the environmental group plaintiffs appealed the district court order dismissing their lawsuit we cannot predict whether this appeal will be successful and if it is successful the outcome of further district court proceedings

navajo plant 

the coowners of the navajo plant and the navajo nation agreed that the navajo plant will remain in operation until december 2019 under the existing plant lease the coowners and the navajo nation executed a lease extension on november 29 2017 that will allow for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceases operations in december 2019 various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives the plants coal supplier and doi have been meeting to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 although we cannot predict whether any alternate plans will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement we believe it is probable that the navajo plant will cease operations in december 2019 

aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant over its previously estimated life through 2026 aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and may be material

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations decreased 03 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer growth were more than offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency distributed renewable generation initiatives and one fewer day of sales due to the leap year in 2016 for the three years 2015 through 2017 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 05  15 for 2018 and increase on average in the range of 05  15 during 2018 through 2020 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in dg and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to approximately 10 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market

operations and maintenance expenses   operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation unplanned outages planned outages typically scheduled in the spring and fall renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors see note 2 for discussion on new accounting guidance related to the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see liquidity and capital resources below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities and income tax impacts related to bonus depreciation 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 112 of the assessed value for 2017 112 for 2016 and 110 for 2015 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units and transmission and distribution facilities 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted and is generally effective on january 1 2018 changes which will impact the company include a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utilities and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized see note 4 for details of the impacts on the company as of december 31 2017 in apss recent general retail rate case the acc approved a tax expense adjustor mechanism which will be used to pass through the income tax effects to retail customers of the tax cuts and jobs act see note 3 for details of the team 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow afudc offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40  as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2017 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 53  its total shareholder equity was approximately 53 billion  and total capitalization was approximately 100 billion  under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 40 billion  

table of contents 

assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was enacted as a result of this legislation bonus depreciation is no longer available for regulated public utility company property acquired or that commenced construction after september 27 2017 the final legislative language contains a transition rule for property which was acquired or under construction prior to september 28 2017 which would allow at least some part of aps’s capital projects under construction at that time to continue to qualify for bonus depreciation under preact rules however because of current ambiguities regarding the scope of this transition rule it is unclear how much of aps’s capital projects which were under construction prior to september 28 2017 will qualify the company currently believes the continued availability of bonus depreciation for property under construction prior to september 28 2017 will generate at least 6075 million of cash tax benefits over the next two years these benefits may be higher if the current ambiguities in the legislative language are clarified in a manner which allows additional expenditures incurred after september 27 2017 related to ongoing capital projects under construction as of that date to qualify for bonus depreciation the cash generated by bonus depreciation is an acceleration of the tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over 20 years and reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes at pinnacle west consolidated when coupled with a lower 21 percent corporate tax rate the continued availability of bonus depreciation to this transition period property is expected to delay until 2019 full cash realization of approximately 85 million of currently unrealized investment tax credits and other tax credits which are recorded as a deferred tax asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2017 the ratio was approximately 50  for pinnacle west and 47  for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of crossdefault provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

this table excludes 42 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain estimated minimum required pension contributions are zero for 2018 2019 and 2020 see note 7 

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

table of contents 

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 1450 million of regulatory assets and 2553 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2017 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2017 is a regulatory asset of 576 million for pension benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if all or a portion of these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2017 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2017 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

see notes 2 and 7 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments held in our coal reclamation escrow account  certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures 

asset retirement obligations 

we recognize an aro for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible longlived assets for which a legal obligation exists the aro liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets aro measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability we use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an aro this approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes the scenarios consider settlement of the aro at the expiration of the power plant’s current license or lease term and expected 

table of contents 

decommissioning dates the fair value of an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the longlived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets in addition we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded aro for these assets in accordance with regulatory accounting aps accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets even if there is no legal obligation for removal 

aros as of december 31 2017 are described further in “note 11 asset retirement obligations” 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted and is generally effective january 1 2018 this legislation made significant changes to the federal income tax laws changes which will impact the company include but are not limited to a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 revisions to the rules related to tax bonus depreciation limitations on interest deductibility and an associated exception for certain public utility property and requirements that certain excess deferred tax amounts of regulated utilities be normalized several sections of the final legislation contain technical ambiguities accordingly it is necessary for management to interpret this legislation and make judgements until further guidance becomes available as a result changes in these judgments could materially affect amounts the company recognized in its financial statements 

deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the change is enacted given the regulatory nature of the company’s business the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities for the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21 which management believes it is probable that a regulatory agency will seek to recover for ratepayers has been recorded as a regulatory liability as of december 31 2017 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with the application of complex laws and regulations which are voluminous and often ambiguous interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time tax positions taken by pinnacle west on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold assuming that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes on the basis of the technical merits 

we record unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions that may not satisfy this more likely than not recognition threshold as liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these liabilities are adjusted when management judgement changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available these changes will be reflected as an increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available

pinnacle west’s other subsidiaries are el dorado bce and 4ca additional information related to these subsidiaries is provided later in this report 

  

our reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

business of arizona public service company 

  

aps currently provides electric service to approximately 12 million customers we own or lease 6236 mw of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both longterm and shortterm purchased power agreements for additional capacity including a variety of agreements for the purchase of renewable energy during 2016 no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 11 of our electric revenues

energy sources and resource planning 

to serve its customers aps obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements resource planning is an important function necessary to meet arizona’s future energy needs aps’s sources of energy by type used to supply energy to native load customers during 2016 were as follows 

  

generation facilities 

  

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2 

  

coalfueled generating facilities 

  

four corners  — four corners is located in the northwestern corner of new mexico and was originally a 5unit coalfired power plant aps owns 100 of units 1 2 and 3 which were retired as of december 30 2013 aps operates the plant and owns 63 of four corners units 4 and 5 following the acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 described below aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 970 mw additionally 4ca a whollyowned subsidiary of pinnacle west owns 7 of units 4 and 5 following its acquisition of el pasos interest in these units described below 

  

on december 30 2013 aps purchased sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million in connection with aps’s prior retail 

table of contents 

rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis on february 23 2015 the acc decision approving the rate adjustments was appealed aps has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding the arizona court of appeals suspended the appeal pending the arizona supreme courts decision in the system improvement benefits sib matter discussed in note 3 on august 8 2016 the arizona supreme court issued its opinion in the sib matter and the arizona court of appeals has now ordered supplemental briefing on how that sib decision should affect the challenge to the four corners rate adjustment we cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved 

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton was retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator through 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 the 2016 coal supply agreement el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

ntec has the option to purchase the 7 interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest 

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the endangered species act esa and the national environmental policy act nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at four corners and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 briefing on the merits of this litigation is expected to extend through may 2017 on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity because the court has placed a stay on all litigation deadlines pending its decision regarding ntecs motion to dismiss the schedule for briefing and the anticipated timeline for completion of this litigation will likely be extended we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its potential effect on four corners 

  

cholla  — cholla was originally a 4unit coalfired power plant which is located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 

table of contents 

and aps operates that unit for pacificorp on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close its 260 mw unit 2 at cholla and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and note 10 for details of the proposal aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the longterm than the benefits that would have resulted from adding the emissions control equipment aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 following the closure of unit 2 aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 387 mw 

on january 13 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating apss compromise approach once the final rule is published in the federal register parties have 60 days to file a petition for review in the ninth circuit court of appeals aps cannot predict at this time whether such petitions will be filed or if they will be successful in addition under the terms of an executive memorandum issued on january 20 2017 this final rule will not be published in the federal register until after it has been reviewed by an appointee of the president we cannot predict when such review will occur and what may result from the additional review 

aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier an affiliate of peabody energy corporation that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders on april 13 2016 peabody energy corporation and certain affiliated entities filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of missouri under the coal supply agreement dated december 21 2005 peabody supplied coal to aps and pacificorp collectively the “buyers” for use at cholla aps believes that the coal supply agreement terminated automatically on april 13 2016 as a result of peabodys bankruptcy filing the buyers filed a motion requesting that the bankruptcy court enter an order determining that the buyers are authorized to enforce the termination provisions in the coal supply agreement 

  

on may 13 2016 peabody filed a complaint against the buyers in the bankruptcy court in which peabody alleged that the buyers breached the coal supply agreement on january 27 2017 the bankruptcy court approved a settlement between the parties and on february 6 2017 the parties executed an amendment to the coal supply agreement that allows for continuation of the agreement with modified terms and conditions acceptable to the parties

navajo generating station  — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in navajo units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2019 with extension rights through 2026 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government the current lease expires in 2019 

on february 13 2017 the coowners of the navajo plant voted not to pursue continued operation of the plant beyond december 2019 the expiration of the current lease term and to pursue a new lease or lease extension with the navajo nation that would allow decommissioning activities to begin after december 2019 instead of later this year various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives and others interested in the continued operation of the plant intend to meet to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 we cannot predict whether any alternate solutions will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement aps is currently

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal —  the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 aps is directly and indirectly involved in several legal proceedings related to doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract  — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a lawsuit against doe in the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims for damages incurred due to doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded 302 million in damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006

aps has submitted two claims pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement for two separate time periods during july 1 2011 through june 30 2015 the doe has approved and paid 539 million for these claims aps’s share is 157 million the amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income apss next claim pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement was submitted to the doe on october 31 2016 and approved on february 1 2017 in the amount 113 million apss share is 33 million payment for the claim is expected in the second quarter of 2017 

the onemill fee  — in 2011 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners and the nuclear energy institute challenged doe’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kwh fee the “onemill fee” paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the standard contract this fee is recovered by aps in its retail rates in june 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” held that doe failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination the dc circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the secretary of the doe “secretary” with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months in february 2013 upon completion of doe’s revised onemill fee adequacy determination the dc circuit reopened the proceedings on november 19 2013 the dc circuit found that the doe did not conduct a legally adequate fee assessment and ordered the secretary to notify congress of his 

table of contents 

intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators as he is required to do pursuant to the nwpa and the dc circuit’s order on january 3 2014 the secretary notified congress of his intention to suspend collection of the onemill fee subject to congress’ disapproval on may 16 2014 the doe notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators who are party to a standard contract that it reduced the onemill fee to zero thus effectively terminating the onemill fee 

  

doe’s construction authorization application for yucca mountain  — the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several interested parties have also intervened in the nrc proceeding additionally a number of interested parties filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application and nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application the cases have been consolidated into one matter at the dc circuit in august 2013 the dc circuit ordered the nrc to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds 

on october 16 2014 the nrc issued volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure and its issuance is a key milestone in the yucca mountain licensing process volume 3 contains the staff’s finding that the doe’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed including but not limited to the postclosure performance objectives in nrc’s regulations 

on december 18 2014 the nrc issued volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository it documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the doe’s research and development and performance confirmation programs as well as other administrative controls and systems meet applicable nrc requirements volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in nrc regulations are met except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights 

publication of volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository 

  

waste confidence   and continued storage  — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s 2010 waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with nepa requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the 2010 waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence

in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel renamed as the continued storage rule the nrc’s decision adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses although palo verde had not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the dc circuit’s june 8 2012 decision the nrc lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the dc circuit issued its june 2012 decision the final continued storage rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals in june 2016 the dc circuit issued its final decision rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the continued storage rule on august 8 2016 the dc circuit denied a petition for rehearing 

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs  — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility we are on track to meet the current site specific decommissioning costs for palo verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned see note 19 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts

which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck 

ocotillo is a 330 mw 4unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw with completion targeted by summer 2019 see note 3 for proposed rate recovery in our current retail rate case on september 9 2016 maricopa county issued a final permit decision that authorizes construction of the ocotillo modernization project and construction will begin in early 2017 

  

solar facilities 

aps developed utility scale solar resources through the 170 mw accapproved az sun program aps invested approximately 675 million in its az sun program these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona in 2016 aps developed the 40mw red rock solar plant which it owns and operates two of our large customers will purchase renewable energy credits from aps that is equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that red rock is projected to generate 

  

additionally aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona additionally aps owns 12 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing an apsowned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid the first stage of the program called the solar partner program placed 8 mw of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as made systems available to limitedincome customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties the second stage of the program which included an additional 2 mw of rooftop solar and energy storage placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 mw on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various gridrelated operation improvements and system interoperability and was in operation by the end of 2016 the acc expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes would not be made until the project was fully in service and aps has requested cost recovery for the project in its currently pending rate case on september 30 2016 aps presented its preliminary findings from the residential rooftop solar program in a filing with the acc 

purchased power contracts    

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 16 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability

 current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2016 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on june 19 2016 at 7051 mw compared to the 2015 peak of 7031 mw recorded on august 15 2015 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2016 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 30 for 2017 due to expiring purchase contracts aps is procuring market resources to maintain its minimum 15 planning reserve criteria 

future resources and resource plan 

aps filed its preliminary 2017 integrated resource plan on march 1 2016 and an updated preliminary 2017 integrated resource plan on september 30 2016 aps also held stakeholder meetings in february and november 2016 in addition to an accled integrated resource plan workshop in july 2016 the preliminary integrated resource plan and associated stakeholder meetings are part of a modified planning process that allows time to incorporate implications of the clean power plan as well as input from stakeholder meetings the final integrated resource plan will be submitted by or on april 3 2017 and the acc is expected to complete its review by february 1 2018 

on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at the other apsowned units units 1 and 3 at the plant by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 previously aps estimated cholla

energy imbalance market 

in 2015 aps and the caiso the operator for the majority of californias transmission grid signed an agreement for aps to begin participation in the energy imbalance market “eim” apss participation in the eim began on october 1 2016 the eim allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15minute blocks with dispatching every five minutes before the energy is needed instead of the traditional one hour blocks aps expects that its participation in eim will lower its fuel costs improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the western interconnection power grid and improve integration of aps’s renewable resources 

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 7 of retail electric sales in 2017 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment and res target for 2016 

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 7 in 2017 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

  



on april 21 2015 the res rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy the rules allow the acc to consider such information in determining whether aps has satisfied the requirements of the res 

table of contents 

renewable energy portfolio  to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1480 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 1440 mw are currently in operation and 40 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 239 mw of facilities owned by aps 629 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 539 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps see energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  solar facilities above for information regarding apsowned solar facilities

demand side management 

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard “ees” of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another in february of 2015 no further workshops are scheduled and no actions were taken as a result of these workshops

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2016 approximately 35 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

subpoena from arizona corporation commissioner robert burns 

on august 25 2016 commissioner burns individually and not by action of the acc as a whole filed subpoenas in aps’s current retail rate proceeding to aps and pinnacle west for the production of records and information relating to a range of expenditures from 2011 through 2016 the subpoenas requested information concerning marketing and advertising expenditures charitable donations lobbying expenses contributions to 501c3 and c4 nonprofits and political contributions the return date for the production of information was set as september 15 2016 the subpoenas also sought testimony from company personnel having knowledge of the material including the chief executive officer 

on september 9 2016 aps filed with the acc a motion to quash the subpoenas or alternatively to stay apss obligations to comply with the subpoenas and decline to decide apss motion pending court proceedings contemporaneously with the filing of this motion aps and pinnacle west filed a complaint for special action and declaratory judgment in the superior court of arizona for maricopa county seeking a declaratory judgment that commissioner burns’ subpoenas are contrary to law on september 15 2016 aps produced all nonconfidential and responsive documents and offered to produce any remaining responsive documents that are confidential after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is signed 

on february 7 2017 commissioner burns opened a new acc docket and indicated that its purpose is to study and rectify problems with transparency and disclosure regarding financial contributions from regulated monopolies or other stakeholders who may appear before the acc that may directly or indirectly benefit an acc commissioner a candidate for acc commissioner or key acc staff as part of this docket commissioner burns set march 24 2017 as a deadline for aps to produce all information previously requested through the subpoenas commissioner burns has also scheduled a workshop in this matter for march 17 2017 aps and pinnacle west cannot predict the outcome of this matter

climate change 

legislative initiatives there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions and it is doubtful whether the 115 th  congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is written enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and 

table of contents 

whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives   in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review nsr analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 2 2014 epa issued two proposed rules to regulate ghg emissions from modified and reconstructed electric generating units egus pursuant to section 111b of the clean air act and existing fossil fuelfired power plants pursuant to clean air act section 111d 

on august 3 2015 epa finalized carbon pollution standards for existing new modified and reconstructed egus epa’s final rules require newly built fossil fuelfired egus along with those undergoing modification or reconstruction to meet co2 performance standards based on a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades epa established separate performance standards for two types of egus stationary combustion turbines typically natural gas and electric utility steam generating units typically coal 

with respect to existing power plants epa’s recently finalized “clean power plan” imposes statespecific goals or targets to achieve reductions in co 2  emission rates from existing egus measured from a 2012 baseline in a significant change from the proposed rule epa’s final performance standards apply directly to specific units based upon their fueltype and configuration ie coal or oilfired steam plants versus combined cycle natural gas plants as such each state’s goal is an emissions performance standard that reflects the fuel mix employed by the egus in operation in those states the final rule provides guidelines to states to help develop their plans for meeting the interim 20222029 and final 2030 and beyond emission performance standards with three distinct compliance periods within that timeframe states were originally required to submit their plans to epa by september 2016 with an optional twoyear extension provided to states establishing a need for additional time however this timing will be impacted by the courtimposed stay described below 

prior to the courtimposed stay described below adeq with input from a technical working group comprised of arizona utilities and other stakeholders was working to develop a compliance plan for submittal to epa since the imposition of the stay adeq is continuing to assess alternatives while completing outreach and soliciting feedback from stakeholders in addition to these ongoing state proceedings epa has taken public comments on proposed model rules and a proposed federal compliance plan which included consideration as to how the clean power plan will apply to egus on tribal land such as the navajo nation 

the legality of the clean power plan is being challenged in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the parties raising this challenge include among others the acc on february 9 2016 the us 

table of contents 

supreme court granted a stay of the clean power plan pending judicial review of the rule which temporarily delays compliance obligations under the clean power plan we cannot predict the extent of the delay 

with respect to our arizona generating units we are currently evaluating the range of compliance options available to adeq including whether arizona deploys a rate or massbased compliance plan based on the fuelmix and location of our arizona egus and the significant investments we have made in renewable generation and demandside energy efficiency if adeq selects a ratebased compliance plan we believe that we will be able to comply with the clean power plan for our arizona generating units in a manner that will not have material financial or operational impacts to the company on the other hand if adeq selects a massbased approach to compliance with the clean power plan our annual cost of compliance could be material these costs could include costs to acquire massbased compliance allowances 

as to our facilities on the navajo nation epa has yet to determine whether or to what extent egus on the navajo nation will be required to comply with the clean power plan epa has proposed to determine that it is necessary or appropriate to impose a federal plan on the navajo nation for compliance with the clean power plan in response we filed comments with epa advocating that such a federal plan is neither necessary nor appropriate to protect air quality on the navajo nation if epa reaches a determination that is consistent with our preferred approach for the navajo nation we believe the clean power plan will not have material financial or operational impacts on our operations within the navajo nation 

alternatively if epa determines that a federal plan is necessary or appropriate for the navajo nation and depending on our need for future operations at our egus located there we may be unable to comply with the federal plan unless we acquire massbased allowances or emission rate credits within established carbon trading markets or curtail our operations subject to the uncertainties set forth below and assuming that epa establishes a federal plan for the navajo nation that requires carbon allowances or credits to be surrendered for plan compliance it is possible we will be required to purchase some quantity of credits or allowances the cost of which could be material 

because adeq has not issued its plan for arizona and because we do not know whether epa will decide to impose a plan or if so what that plan will require there are a number of uncertainties associated with our potential cost exposure these uncertainties include whether judicial review will result in the clean power plan being vacated in whole or in part or if not the extent of any resulting compliance deadline delays whether any plan will be imposed for egus on the navajo nation the future existence and liquidity of allowance or credit compliance trading markets the applicability of existing contractual obligations with current and former owners of our participantowned coalfired egus the type of federal or state compliance plan either rate or massbased whether or not the trading of allowances or credits will be authorized mechanisms for compliance with any final epa or adeq plan and how units that have been closed will be treated for allowance or credit allocation purposes 

in the event that the incurrence of compliance costs is not economically viable or prudent for our operations in arizona or on the navajo nation or if we do not have the option of acquiring allowances to account for the emissions from our operations we may explore other options including reduced levels of output or potential plant closures as alternatives to purchasing allowances given these uncertainties our analysis of the available compliance options remains ongoing and additional information or considerations may arise that change our expectations 

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives that address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning  current and future resources” above for details of these plans and

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules    in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with epa’s final bart determinations and cholla’s obligations to comply with adeq’s and epa’s determinations coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

cholla aps believes that epa’s original 2012 final rule establishing controls constituting bart for cholla which would require installation of selective catalytic reduction scr controls with a cost to aps of approximately 100 million is unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s state implementation plan sip and promulgating a federal implementation plan fip that is inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program accordingly on february 1 2013 aps filed a petition for review of the final bart rule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit briefing in the case was completed in february 2014 

in september 2014 aps met with epa to propose a compromise bart strategy pending certain regulatory approvals aps would permanently close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset aps made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment is unlikely to be required in the future because retiring andor converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more cost effective than and will result in increased visibility improvement over the current bart requirements for nox imposed on the cholla units under epas bart fip aps’s proposal involves state and federal rulemaking processes in light of these ongoing administrative proceedings on february 19 2015 aps pacificorp owner of cholla unit 4 and epa jointly moved the court to sever and hold in abeyance those claims in the litigation pertaining to cholla pending regulatory actions by the state and epa the court granted the parties unopposed motion on february 20 2015 

on october 16 2015 adeq issued a revised operating permit for cholla which incorporates apss proposal and subsequently submitted a proposed revision to the sip to the epa which would incorporate the new permit terms on june 30 2016 epa issued a proposed rule approving a revision to the arizona sip that incorporates aps’s compromise approach for compliance with the regional haze program epa signed the final rule approving the agencys proposal on january 13 2017 once the final rule is published in the federal register parties have 60 days to file a petition for review in the ninth circuit court of appeals aps cannot 

table of contents 

predict at this time whether such petitions will be filed or if they will be successful in addition under the terms of an executive memorandum issued on january 20 2017 this final rule will not be published in the federal register until after it has been reviewed by an appointee of the president we cannot predict when such review will occur and what may result from the additional review 

four corners  based on epa’s final standards aps estimates that its 63 share of the cost of required controls for four corners units 4 and 5 would be approximately 400 million in addition aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el pasos 7 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 ntec has the option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec in december 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the cost of the pollution controls related to the 7 interest is approximately 45 million which will be assumed by the ultimate owner of the 7 interest 

navajo plant  on july 28 2014 epa issued a final navajo plant bart rule aps estimates that its share of costs for upgrades at the navajo plant based on epa’s fip could be up to approximately 200 million in october 2014 a coalition of environmental groups an indian tribe and others filed petitions for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit asking the court to review epas final bart rule for the navajo plant we cannot predict the outcome of this review process see business of arizona public service company  energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities  navajo generating station above for information regarding future plans for the navajo plant 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants    in 2011 epa issued rules establishing maximum achievable control technology standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired plants aps estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately 8 million for cholla no additional equipment is needed for four corners units 4 and 5 to comply with these rules srp the operating agent for the navajo plant estimates that apss share of costs for equipment necessary to comply with the rules is approximately 1 million the majority of which has already been incurred litigation concerning the rules including supplemental analyses epa has prepared in support of the mats regulation is ongoing these proceedings do not materially impact aps regardless of the results from further judicial or administrative proceedings concerning the mats rulemaking the arizona state mercury rule the stringency of which is roughly equivalent to that of mats would still apply to cholla 

coal combustion waste   on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent’s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity while epa has chosen to regulate the disposal of ccr in landfills and surface impoundments as nonhazardous waste under the final rule the agency makes clear that it will continue to evaluate any risks associated with ccr disposal and leaves open the possibility that it may regulate ccr as a hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c in the future 

  

table of contents 

on december 16 2016 president obama signed the water infrastructure improvements for the nation wiin act into law which contains a number of provisions requiring epa to modify the selfimplementing provisions of the agencys current ccr rules under subtitle d such modifications include new epa authority to directly enforce the ccr rules through the use of administrative orders and providing states like arizona where the cholla facility is located the option of developing ccr disposal unit permitting programs subject to epa approval for facilities in states that do not develop statespecific permitting programs epa is required to develop a federal permit program pending the availability of congressional appropriations by contrast for facilities located within the boundaries of native american tribal reservations such as the navajo nation where the navajo plant and four corners facilities are located epa is required to develop a federal permit program regardless of appropriated funds because epa has yet to undertake rulemaking proceedings to implement the ccr provisions of the wiin act and arizona has yet to determine whether it will develop a statespecific permitting program it is unclear what effects the ccr provisions of the wiin act will have on apss management of ccr 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 15 million aps is currently evaluating compliance alternatives for cholla and estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for this plant is in the range of 5 million to 40 million based upon which compliance alternatives are ultimately selected the navajo plant currently disposes of ccr in a dry landfill storage area aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant is approximately 1 million the majority of which has already been incurred additionally the ccr rule requires ongoing groundwater monitoring depending upon the results of such monitoring at each of cholla four corners and the navajo plant we may be required to take corrective actions the costs of which we are unable to reasonably estimate at this time 

pursuant to a june 24 2016 order by the dc circuit court of appeals in the litigation by industry and environmentalgroups challenging epa’s ccr regulations within the next three years epa is required to complete a rulemaking proceeding concerning whether or not boron must be included on the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action under epa’s ccr rules epa is not required to take final action approving the inclusion of boron but epa must propose and consider its inclusion should epa take final action adding boron to the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action any resulting corrective action measures may increase apss costs of compliance with the ccr rule at our coalfired generating facilities at this time though aps cannot predict when epa will commence its rulemaking concerning boron or the eventual results of those proceedings 

effluent limitation guidelines   on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate compliance with these limitations will be required in connection with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes discharge permit renewals which occur in fiveyear intervals that arise between 2018 and 2023 until a draft npdes permit for four corners is proposed during that timeframe we are uncertain what will be required to control these discharges in compliance with the finalized effluent limitations at that facility cholla and the navajo plant do not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” at a level of 70 parts per billion 

table of contents 

“ppb” with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa is expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 depending on when epa approves attainment designations for the arizona and navajo nation jurisdictions in which our fossil generation units are located revisions to sips and fips respectively implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard are expected to be in place between 2020 and 2021 at this time because proposed sips and fips implementing the revised ozone naaqss have yet to be released aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting aps 

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties prps prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan rifs the ou3 working group parties have agreed to a schedule with epa that calls for the submission of a revised draft rifs by june 2017 we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 2 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district rid filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area on january 25 2015 adeq sent a letter to aps seeking information concerning the degree to which if any aps’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area aps responded to adeq on may 4 2015 on december 16 2016 two rid contractors filed ancillary lawsuits for recovery of costs against aps and the other defendants we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters however we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant   sites   certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

federal agency environmental lawsuit related to four corners 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the esa and nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the four corners power plant and

the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 briefing on the merits of this litigation is expected to extend through may 2017 on september 15 2016 ntec the company that owns the adjacent mine filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity because the court has placed a stay on all litigation deadlines pending its decision regarding ntecs motion to dismiss the schedule for briefing and the anticipated timeline for completion of this litigation will likely be extended we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its potential effect on four corners  

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs the four corners region in which four corners is located has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area however during the past 12 months the region has received snowfall and precipitation sufficient to recover the navajo reservoir to an optimum operating level reducing the probability of shortage in future years although the watershed and reservoirs are in a good condition at this time aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants 

table of contents 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations 

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over aps’s groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

little colorado river adjudication   aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances 

aps is currently pursuing certain activities such as microgrid investments and construction of renewable facilities intended for specific customers to date aps has not received regulatory assurance of cost  recovery for such investments as aps engages in these activities we will have to demonstrate to regulators as we do with all other capital investments that these investments are both prudent and useful in providing electric service to customers 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities including palo verde in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases water quality discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up  aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

  

regional haze   aps has received final rulemakings imposing new requirements on four corners cholla and the navajo plant pursuant to these rules epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes bart to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

coal ash   in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and in a dry landfill storage area at the navajo plant to the extent 

table of contents 

the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal 

ozone national ambient air quality standards   in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides which set new more stringent standards intended to protect human health and human welfare depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas    

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

aps faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co2 which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

potential financial risks  greenhouse gas regulation the clean power plan and potential litigation   in  2015 epa finalized a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates could result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company see note 10 for additional risks and uncertainties resulting from the clean power plan 

depending on the final outcome of the pending judicial review of the clean power plan or any related legislative or regulatory activity the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative ghg emission limitations from power plants alternative ghg emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant ghg emissions 

physical and operational risks    weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

table of contents 

coowners of our jointly owned generation facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation regulations economic conditions or changes in our industry which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities 

aps owns certain of our power plants jointly with other owners with varying ownership interests in such facilities changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources fuel costs legislation and regulation together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities could result in unaligned positions among coowners such differences in the coowners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could ultimately lead to disagreements among the parties as to how and whether to continue operation of such plants which could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

one of these options would be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generation  1 pilot program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation on november 25 2015 the acc issued an order approving a request by several ag1 customers and suppliers to extend the term of the program from july 1 2016 to the conclusion of apss pending general rate case the order also authorized aps to defer for future recovery unmitigated unrecovered costs attributable to the program at 90 of the first 10 million per year and at 100 of amounts above 10 million per year 

  

proposals to enable or support retail electric competition may be made from time to time through ballot initiatives legislative or other forums in arizona we cannot predict future regulatory or legislative action that might result in increased competition 

changes in tax legislation or regulation may affect our financial results 

we are subject to taxation by various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels legislation or regulation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities which could affect the company’s tax positions the prospects for broadbased federal tax reform have increased due to the results of the 2016 elections any such reform may impact the companys effective tax rate cash taxes paid and other financial results such as earnings per share gross revenues and cash flows we cannot predict the timing or extent of 

table of contents 

such taxrelated developments which absent appropriate regulatory treatment could have a negative impact on our financial results 

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy resources   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 cumulative annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the settlement agreement in aps’s most recent retail rate case the “2012 settlement agreement” includes a mechanism the lfcr to address these matters 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs 

in addition to these rules and requirements energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth  retail customers in apss service territory increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with the prior year for the three years 2014 through 2016 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 13 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 1525 for 2017 and to average in the range of 2030 for 2017 through 2019 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations were flat for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer growth and an additional day of sales due to leap year were equally offset by energy savings driven by 

table of contents 

customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2014 through 2016 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 02 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 010 for 2017 and increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2017 through 2019 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations 

actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed renewable generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if we experience acceleration of expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives we may be unable to reach our estimated sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others concerns over physical security of these assets include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including those related to financing siting permitting new and evolving technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from the intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in expressing concerns about the environmental and climaterelated impacts from continued extraction transportation delivery and combustion of fossil fuels environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of fossil fuel 

table of contents 

infrastructure projects these efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables including the future course of federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities aps cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks   and risks of unauthorized access to our systems 

  

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including confidential customer employee financial or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access our generation transmission and distribution facilities information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the increasing promulgation of nerc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards which includes potential financial penalties 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems the implementation of additional security measures could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect pinnacle west’s and aps’s reputation with customers and the public 

table of contents 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants and portions of certain aps transmission lines are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 111 million but not more than 166 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

table of contents 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation and increase the complexity of managing apss information technology and power system operations which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment the implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to the information technology and operational technology systems which could require additional infrastructure and resources widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s traditional business model 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make apss existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 35 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2019 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy financial regulation or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

• causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

• increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

   

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

table of contents 

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic social and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise while most of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions have been implemented changes to the act or other potential legislation could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly owned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

table of contents 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 



table of contents 

   

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 



  

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2017 plan aps projects it will develop 52 miles of new transmission lines over the next ten years one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the palo verde to morgan system includes palo verdedelaneysun valleymorganpinnacle peak the project consists of four phases the first three phases morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv palo verde to delaney 500kv and delaney to sun valley 500kv are currently inservice the fourth phase morgan to sun valley 500kv has started construction and is expected to be energized by may 2018 in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed with the capability to string a 230kv line as a second circuit 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which have been completed and were included in previous aps transmission plans are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california the north gila to hassayampa line went into service in may 2015 and the delaney to palo verde line went into service in may 2016 

physical security standards on july 14 2015 ferc approved version 2 of the proposed physical security reliability standard cip014 cip0142 as a result cip0142 the physical security reliability standard that requires transmission owners and operators to protect those critical transmission stations and substations and their associated primary control centers that if rendered inoperable or damaged as a result of a physical attack could result in widespread instability uncontrolled separation or cascading within an interconnection became effective on october 2 2015 triggering a series of staggered but interdependent obligations for aps as required by the physical security reliability standard aps determined its critical transmission stations and substations and associated primary control centers that were required to comply with the standard by october 2 2015 however as contemplated under cip0142 this verification triggered additional requirements and obligations within the physical security reliability standard these remaining obligations which consist of a risk evaluation and development and verification of a physical security plan were largely completed in 2016 and the remaining activities are projected to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of 2017 until aps has completed all required activities under the physical security reliability standard we cannot predict the extent of any financial or operational impacts on aps

of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

overview 

  

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps currently accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings 

  

areas of business focus 

  

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

  

nuclear aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde palo verde experienced strong performance during 2016 with the completion of two refueling outages the fall refueling outage was completed in 28 days with the lowest collective radiation exposure dose for any pressurized water reactor outage 

coal and related environmental matters and transactions   aps is a joint owner of three coalfired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning ghg emissions on june 2 2014 epa proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the clean power plan and epa finalized its proposal on august 3 2015 

epa’s nationwide co 2  emissions reduction goal is 32 below 2005 emission levels as finalized for the state of arizona and the navajo nation compliance with the clean power plan could involve a shift in generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation until implementation plans for these jurisdictions are finalized we are unable to determine the actual impacts to aps see note 10 for information regarding challenges to the legality of the clean power plan and a courtordered stay of the clean power plan pending judicial review of the rule which temporarily delays compliance obligations aps continually analyzes its longrange capital management plans to assess the potential effects of these changes understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to continue participation in such plants

cholla 

on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close its 260 mw unit 2 at cholla and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required air emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and note 10 for details of the proposal aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the longterm than the benefits that would have resulted from adding emissions control equipment aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 on january 13 2017 epa approved a final rule incorporating apss compromise proposal once the final rule is published in the federal register parties have 60 days to file a petition for review in the ninth circuit court of appeals aps cannot predict at this time whether such petitions will be filed or if they will be successful in addition under the terms of an executive memorandum issued on january 20 2017 this final rule will not be published in the federal register until after it has been reviewed by an appointee of the president we cannot predict when such review will occur and what may result from the additional review 

four corners 

  

asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters   on december 30 2013 aps purchased sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million in connection with aps’s prior retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis on february 23 2015 the acc decision approving the rate adjustments was appealed aps has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding the arizona court of appeals suspended the appeal pending the arizona supreme courts decision in the sib matter discussed below on august 8 2016 the arizona supreme court issued its opinion in the sib matter and the arizona court of appeals has now ordered supplemental briefing on how that sib decision should affect the challenge to the four corners rate adjustment we cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved 

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction described above bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton was retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator through 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed the 2016 coal supply agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 through 2031 el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners 4ca purchased the el paso interest on july 6 2016 the purchase price was immaterial in amount and 4ca assumed el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest 

ntec has the option to purchase the 7 interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec provided notice of its intent to exercise the option the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest 

lease extension   aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 

table of contents 

2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine 

on april 20 2016 several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against osm and other federal agencies in the district of arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of four corners and the adjacent mine the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the esa and nepa in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the four corners power plant and the adjacent navajo mine past july 6 2016 aps filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings which was granted on august 3 2016 briefing on the merits of this litigation is expected to extend through may 2017 on september 15 2016 ntec filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on ntecs tribal sovereign immunity because the court has placed a stay on all litigation deadlines pending its decision regarding ntecs motion to dismiss the schedule for briefing and the anticipated timeline for completion of this litigation will likely be extended we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its potential effect on four corners 

  

navajo plant 

on february 13 2017 the coowners of the navajo plant voted not to pursue continued operation of the plant beyond december 2019 the expiration of the current lease term and to pursue a new lease or lease extension with the navajo nation that would allow decommissioning activities to begin after december 2019 instead of later this year various stakeholders including regulators tribal representatives and others interested in the continued operation of the plant intend to meet to determine if an alternate solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019 we cannot predict whether any alternate solutions will be found that would be acceptable to all of the stakeholders and feasible to implement aps is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the navajo plant aps will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant 108 million as of december 31 2016 see note 9 for additional details plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure which are still being assessed and which may be material we cannot predict whether aps would obtain such recovery 

  

on february 14 2017 the acc opened a docket titled acc investigation concerning the future of the navajo generating station with the stated goal of engaging stakeholders and negotiating a sustainable pathway for the navajo plant to continue operating in some form after december 2019 aps cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding

demand side management  in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this standard became effective on january 1 2011 

  

in march 2014 the acc approved a resource savings initiative that allows aps to count towards compliance with the acc electric energy efficiency standards savings from improvements to aps’s transmission and delivery system generation and facilities that have been approved through a dsm plan 

  

on march 20 2015 aps filed an application with the acc requesting a budget of 689 million for 2015 and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio going forward including for the first time three resource savings projects which reflect energy savings on apss system the acc approved aps’s 2015 dsm budget on november 25 2015 in its decision the acc also approved that verified energy savings from aps’s resource savings projects could be counted toward compliance with the electric energy efficiency standard however the acc ruled that aps was not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of its achievement tier level for its performance incentive nor may aps include savings from conservation voltage reduction in the calculation of its lfcr mechanism 

on june 1 2015 aps filed its 2016 dsm plan requesting a budget of 689 million and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio to increase energy savings and cost effectiveness of the programs on april 1 2016 aps filed an amended 2016 dsm plan that sought minor modifications to its existing dsm plan and requested to continue the current dsmac and current budget of 689 million on july 12 2016 the acc approved aps’s amended dsm plan and directed aps to spend up to an additional 4 million on a new residential demand response or load management program that facilitates energy storage technology on december 5 2016 aps filed for acc approval of a 4 million residential demand response energy storage and load management program 

on june 1 2016 the company filed its 2017 dsm implementation plan in which aps proposes programs and measures that specifically focus on reducing peak demand shifting load to offpeak periods and educating customers about strategies to manage their energy and demand the requested budget in the 2017 dsm implementation plan is 626 million on january 27 2017 aps filed an updated and modified 2017 dsm implementation plan that incorporated the proposed residential demand response energy storage and load management program and the requested budget increased to 666 million the acc has not yet ruled on the company’s 2017 dsm plan 

electric energy efficiency on june 27 2013 the acc voted to open a new docket investigating whether the electric energy efficiency standards should be modified the acc held a series of three workshops in march and april 2014 to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs cost recovery mechanisms incentives and potential changes to the electric energy efficiency and resource planning rules 

on november 4 2014 the acc staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to arizona’s electric utility energy efficiency standards the draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards the acc accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on december 19 2014 on july 12 2016 the acc ordered that acc staff convene a workshop within 120 days to discuss a number of issues related to the electric energy efficiency standards including the process of determining the cost effectiveness of dsm programs and the treatment of

rate matters   aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by ferc see note 3 for information on aps’s ferc rates 

on june 1 2016 aps filed an application with the acc for an annual increase in retail base rates of 1659 million this amount excludes amounts that are currently collected on customer bills through adjustor mechanisms the application requests that some of the balances in these adjustor accounts aggregating to approximately 2676 million as of december 31 2015 be transferred into base rates through the ratemaking process this transfer would not have an incremental effect on average customer bills the average annual customer bill impact of aps’s request is an increase of 574 the average annual bill impact for a typical aps residential customer is 796   see note 3 for details regarding the principal provisions of apss application 

aps requested that the increase become effective july 1 2017 on july 22 2016 the alj set a procedural schedule for the rate proceeding which supported completing the case within 12 months the acc staff and intervenors began filing their direct testimony in late december 2016 and additional filings of testimony are ongoing on january 12 2017 aps began settlement discussions with all parties on january 13 2017 the alj hearing the case before the acc issued a procedural order delaying hearings on the case from the originally scheduled march 22 2017 to april 24 2017 to allow parties to participate in settlement discussions and prepare testimony on the distributed generation dg rate design issues addressed in the value and cost of dg decision described below according to the procedural order settlement discussions are to be completed and if applicable any related settlement must be filed by march 17 2017 the procedural order also extended the rate case completion date as calculated by commission rule for an additional 33 days aps cannot predict the outcome of this case 

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

  

as part of aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 aps and sce agreed via a transmission termination agreement that upon closing of the acquisition the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement transmission agreement between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system the arizona transmission system for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps previously submitted a request to ferc related to this termination which resulted in a ferc order denying rate recovery of 40 million that aps agreed to pay sce associated with the termination on december 22 2015 aps and sce agreed to terminate the transmission termination agreement and allow for the transmission agreement to expire according to its terms which includes settling obligations in accordance with the terms of the transmission agreement aps established a regulatory asset of 12 million in 2015 in connection with the payment required under the terms of the transmission agreement on july 1 2016 ferc issued an order denying aps’s request to recover the regulatory asset through its fercjurisdictional rates aps and sce completed the termination of the transmission agreement on july 6 2016 aps made the required payment to sce and wroteoff the 12 million regulatory asset and charged operating revenues to reflect the effects of this order in the second quarter of 2016 on july 29 2016 aps filed for a rehearing with ferc in its order denying recovery ferc also referred to its enforcement division a question of whether the agreement between aps and sce relating to the settlement of obligations under the

net metering   in 2015 the acc voted to conduct a generic evidentiary hearing on the value and cost of distributed generation to gather information that will inform the acc on net metering issues and cost of service studies in upcoming utility rate cases a hearing was held in april 2016 on october 7 2016 an alj issued a recommendation in the docket concerning the value and cost of dg solar installations on december 20 2016 the acc completed its open meeting to consider the recommended decision by the alj after making several amendments the acc approved the recommended decision by a 41 vote as a result of the acc’s action effective following aps’s pending rate case the current net metering tariff that governs payments for energy exported to the grid from rooftop solar systems will be replaced by a more formuladriven approach that will utilize inputs from historical wholesale solar power costs and eventually an avoided cost methodology 

as amended the decision provides that payments by utilities for energy exported to the grid from dg solar facilities will be determined using a resource comparison proxy methodology a method that is based on the price that aps pays for utilityscale solar projects on a five year rolling average while a forecasted avoided cost methodology is being developed the price established by this resource comparison proxy method will be updated annually between rate cases but will not be decreased by more than 10 per year once the avoided cost methodology is developed the acc will determine in apss subsequent rate cases which method or a combination of methods is appropriate to determine the actual price to be paid by that utility for exported distributed energy 

in addition the acc made the following determinations 

 

 

 

this decision of the acc addresses policy determinations only the decision states that its principles will be applied in future rate cases and the policy determinations themselves may be subject to future change as are all acc policies the determination of the initial export energy price to be paid by aps will be made in aps’s currently pending rate case which is scheduled for hearing by the acc in april 2017 aps cannot predict the outcome of this determination 

the acc’s decision did not make any policy determinations as to any specific costs to be charged to dg solar system customers for their use of the grid the determination of any such costs will be made in apss future rate cases 

on january 23 2017 the alliance for solar choice tasc sought rehearing of the accs decision regarding the value and cost of dg tasc asserts that the acc improperly ignored the administrative procedure act failed to give adequate notice regarding the scope of the proceedings and relied on information that was not submitted as evidence among other alleged defects tascs request for rehearing is required for

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2014 through 2016 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 94 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

actual and projected customer and sales growth  retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with the prior year for the three years 2014 through 2016 aps’s customer growth averaged 13 per year we currently project annual customer growth to be 1525 for 2017 and to average in the range of 2030 for 2017 through 2019 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona 

retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations were flat for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with the prior year improving economic conditions and customer 

table of contents 

growth and an additional day of sales due to the leap year were equally offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2014 through 2016 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 02 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase in the range of 010 for 2017 and increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2017 through 2019 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy or acceleration of the expected effects of customer conservation energy efficiency or distributed renewable generation initiatives could further impact these estimates 

  

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

operations and maintenance expenses   operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see capital expenditures below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities see note 3 regarding deferral of certain costs pursuant to an acc order 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 112 of the assessed value for 2016 110 for 2015 and 107 for 2014 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units transmission and distribution facilities see note 3 for property tax deferrals contained in the 2012 settlement agreement 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities the prospects for broadbased federal tax reform have increased due to the results of the 2016 elections any such reform may impact the companys effective tax

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40  as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2016 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 54  its total shareholder equity was approximately 49 billion  and total capitalization was approximately 91 billion  under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 36 billion  assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west 

many of aps’s current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation on december 18 2015 president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act 2016 hr 2029 which contained an extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 enactment of this legislation is expected to generate approximately 300350 million of cash tax benefits over the next three years which is expected to be fully realized by aps and pinnacle west during this time frame the cash generated by the extension of bonus depreciation is an acceleration of the tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over 20 years and reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes at pinnacle west consolidated the extension of bonus depreciation will in turn delay until 2019 full cash realization of approximately 98 million of currently unrealized investment tax credits which are recorded as a deferred tax asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016

table of contents 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements and term loan facilities contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

table of contents 

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 1420 million of regulatory assets and 1049 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2016 is a regulatory asset of 711 million for pension benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if all or a portion of these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2016 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2016 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

see note 7 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion on accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures

transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis on february 23 2015 the acc decision approving the rate adjustment was appealed aps has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding the arizona court of appeals has suspended the appeal pending the arizona supreme courts decision in the sib matter discussed in note 3 which could have an effect on the outcome of this four corners proceeding we cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved 

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 when the current coal supply agreement expires through 2031 the “2016 coal supply agreement” el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the cash purchase price which will be subject to certain adjustments at closing is immaterial in amount and the purchaser will assume el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july 2016

palo verde leases —  in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities the leaseback was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 and contained options to renew the leases or to purchase the leased property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms on july 7 2014 aps exercised the fixed rate lease renewal options the length of the renewal options resulted in aps retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases at the end of the lease renewal periods aps will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value extend the leases for up to two years or return the assets to the lessors see note 18 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses  — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle —  the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

• mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

• conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

• enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

• fabrication of fuel assemblies 

• utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

• storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2018 and 45 of its requirements in 20192025 the participants have also contracted for 100 of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2020 and 20 of its enrichment services for 20212026 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2022 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal —  the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 aps is directly and indirectly involved in several legal proceedings related to doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract  — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a lawsuit against doe in the us court of federal claims for damages incurred due to doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded 302 million in damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to doe’s failure to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 on august 18 2014 aps and doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment of 574 million by doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified 

table of contents 

costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 aps’s share of this amount is 167 million 

aps’s first claim made pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement which was for the period july 1 2011 through june 30 2014 was for 420 million aps’s share of this amount was 122 million and payment was received on june 1 2015 aps’s second claim made pursuant to the terms of the august 18 2014 settlement agreement which was for the period july 1 2014 through june 30 2015 and was for 120 million apss share of this amount is 36 million was submitted to the doe on november 2 2015 the second claim is presently being reviewed by doe 

amounts recovered in the lawsuit and settlement were recorded as adjustments to regulatory liability and had no impact on current income 

the onemill fee  — in 2011 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners and the nuclear energy institute challenged doe’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kwh fee the “onemill fee” paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the standard contract this fee is recovered by aps in its retail rates in june 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” held that doe failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination the dc circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the secretary of the doe “secretary” with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months in february 2013 upon completion of doe’s revised onemill fee adequacy determination the dc circuit reopened the proceedings on november 19 2013 the dc circuit found that the doe did not conduct a legally adequate fee assessment and ordered the secretary to notify congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators as he is required to do pursuant to the nwpa and the dc circuit’s order on january 3 2014 the secretary notified congress of his intention to suspend collection of the onemill fee subject to congress’ disapproval on may 16 2014 the doe notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators who are party to a standard contract that it reduced the onemill fee to zero thus effectively terminating the onemill fee 

  

doe’s construction authorization application for yucca mountain  — the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several interested parties have also intervened in the nrc proceeding additionally a number of interested parties filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application and nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application the cases have been consolidated into one matter at the dc circuit in august 2013 the dc circuit ordered the nrc to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds 

on october 16 2014 the nrc issued volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure and its issuance is a key milestone in the yucca mountain licensing process volume 3 contains the staff’s finding that the doe’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed including but not limited to the postclosure performance objectives in nrc’s regulations 

on december 18 2014 the nrc issued volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository it documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the doe’s 

table of contents 

research and development and performance confirmation programs as well as other administrative controls and systems meet applicable nrc requirements volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in nrc regulations are met except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights 

publication of volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository 

  

waste confidence  — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s 2010 waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with the national environmental policy act “nepa” requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the 2010 waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision the nrc commissioners also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of september 6 2012 

in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel the continued storage rule adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses although palo verde had not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the dc circuit’s june 8 2012 decision the nrc lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the dc circuit issued its june 2012 decision the august 26th final rule has been subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals 

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs  — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances site specific decommissioning cost studies anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating

impact of earthquake and tsunami in japan on nuclear energy industry  — on march 11 2011 an earthquake measuring 90 on the richter scale occurred off the coast of japan causing a series of seven tsunamis as a result the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station experienced severe damage 

following the earthquake and tsunamis the nrc established a task force to conduct a systematic and methodical review of nrc processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system on march 12 2012 the nrc issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the near term task force with respect to palo verde the nrc issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding 1 mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at the plant and 2 enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation 

  

the nrc has issued a number of guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements palo verde has met the nrc’s imposed deadlines for installation of equipment to address these requirements but has minor additional work to perform in 2016 palo verde has spent approximately 125 million on capital enhancements as of december 31 2015 aps’s share is 291 

  

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near palo verde ocotillo located in tempe discussed below sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oilonly power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oilonly combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3179 mw gas for these plants is financially hedged up to three years in advance of purchasing and the gas is generally purchased one month prior to delivery aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck 

ocotillo is a 330 mw 4unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw with completion targeted by summer 2019 aps completed a competitive solicitation process in which the ocotillo project was evaluated against other alternatives consistent with the independent monitor’s report the ocotillo project was selected as the best alternative aps must finalize the permitting process before construction begins 

  

solar facilities 

to date aps has begun operation of 170 mw of utility scale solar through its az sun program discussed below these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona 

  

table of contents 

additionally aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona additionally aps owns 12 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing a 10 mwdc approximately 85 mwac residential rooftop program the first stage of the residential rooftop solar program called the solar partner program is to be 8 mw followed by a 2 mw second stage that will only be deployed if coupled with distributed storage under this program aps will own operate and maintain approximately 1500 residential systems the program will target specific distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits while employing multiple use cases that will lead to a better understanding of the byproducts stemming from the multitude of complex technical interactions occurring as distributed energy resources are employed on the aps grid 

  

purchased power contracts 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 16 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability 

  

purchased power capacity —  aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts as of december 31 2015 is summarized in the table below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted

current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2015 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on august 15 2015 at 7031 mw compared to the 2014 peak of 7007 mw recorded on july 23 2014 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2015 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 28 excluding certain contractual rights to call on additional capacity on short notice which aps may use in the event of unusual weather or unplanned outages the 2015 reserve margin was 21 aps anticipates the reserve margin for 2016 will be approximately 24 due to expiring purchase contracts and anticipated load growth aps anticipates additional resources will be needed by 2017 in order to maintain its 15 planning reserve criteria 

  

future resources and resource plan 

on may 8 2015 the acc acknowledged aps’s 2014 resource plan under the acc’s resource planning rule aps’s next resource plan would be due on april 1 2016 on september 16 2015 however the acc issued an order extending the timeframe for all utilities including aps to file their next resource plans the new schedule is designed to allow utilities additional time to consider the impacts of the clean power plan and improve the resource planning process by allowing more time for input and review by the acc and applicable stakeholders under the revised schedule aps will file a preliminary resource plan on march 1 2016 and a final resource plan on april 3 2017 the revised schedule provides that the acc will complete its review by february 1 2018 

on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close cholla unit 2 and cease burning coal at the other apsowned units units 1 and 3 at the plant by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 previously aps estimated cholla unit 2’s end of life to be 2033 aps is currently recovering a return on and of the net book value of the unit in base rates and plans to seek recovery of the unit’s decommissioning and other retirementrelated costs over the remaining life of the plant in its next retail rate case aps believes it will be allowed recovery of the remaining net book value of unit 2 122 million as of december 31 2015 in addition to a return on its investment in accordance with gaap in the third quarter of 2014 unit 2’s remaining net book value was reclassified from property plant and equipment to a regulatory asset if the acc does not allow full recovery of the remaining net book value of cholla unit 2 all or a portion of the regulatory asset will be written off and aps’s net income cash flows and financial position will be negatively impacted 

  

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 6 of retail electric sales in 2016 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment and res target for 2015 

a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 6 in 2016 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

table of contents 

  



in 2013 the acc conducted a hearing to consider apss proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits on february 6 2014 the acc established a proceeding to modify the renewable energy rules to establish a process for compliance with the renewable energy requirement that is not based solely on the use of renewable energy credits on september 9 2014 the acc authorized a rulemaking process to modify the res rules the proposed changes would permit the acc to find that utilities have complied with the distributed energy requirement in light of all available information the acc adopted these changes on december 18 2014 the revised rules went into effect on april 21 2015 

  

renewable energy portfolio  to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1328 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 1278 mw are currently in operation and 50 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 189 mw of facilities owned by aps 629 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 427 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps in september 2015 aps completed construction of its 170 mw az sun program aps has invested approximately 675 million in its az sun program see note 3 for additional details about the az sun program

 demand side management 

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard “ees” of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations 

  

government awards 

  

through various doe initiatives the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs in 2015 aps completed its work on a 3 million financial award for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff arizona 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service territory in 1999 and 2000 there are 

table of contents 

currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers in 2000 the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals’ decision 

  

in 2008 the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals’ decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august 12 2010 the report stated that additional analysis discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another in february of 2015 no further workshops are scheduled and no actions were taken as a result of these workshops 

  

on january 28 2016 an acc commissioner robert l burns sent aps a notice of investigation pursuant to an arizona statute that authorizes a commissioner and his agents to inspect the accounts books papers and documents of any public service corporation and examine under oath any officer agent or employee of such corporation in relation to the business and affairs of the corporation the notice states that commissioner burns intends to investigate whether aps has used funds recoverable from ratepayers for political contributions lobbying or charitable donations purposes whether aps’s corporate affiliates have made contributions or donations under aps’ brand name and the degree to which aps and pinnacle west are “intertwined” in terms of organization management and operations aps intends to cooperate with this investigation to the full extent that the matter is   lawfully authorized but cannot predict its timing or outcome 

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2015 approximately 52 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio

environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative initiatives there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions and it is unclear whether the 114 th  congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives   in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review nsr analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants 

on june 2 2014 epa issued two proposed rules to regulate ghg emissions from modified and reconstructed electric generating units egus pursuant to section 111b of the clean air act and existing fossil fuelfired power plants pursuant to clean air act section 111d on august 3 2015 epa finalized each of these carbon pollution standards for existing new modified and reconstructed egus 

epa’s final rules require newly built fossil fuelfired egus along with those undergoing modification or reconstruction to meet co 2  performance standards based on a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades epa established separate performance standards for two types of egus stationary combustion turbines typically natural gas and electric utility steam generating units typically coal 

with respect to existing power plants epa’s recently finalized “clean power plan” imposes statespecific goals or targets to achieve reductions in co 2  emission rates from existing egus measured from a 2012 baseline in a significant change from the proposed rule epa’s final performance standards apply directly to specific units based upon their fueltype and configuration ie coal or oilfired steam plants versus combined cycle natural gas plants as such each state’s goal is an emissions performance standard that reflects the fuel mix employed by the egus in operation in those states the final rule provides guidelines to states to help develop their plans for meeting the interim 20222029 and final 2030 and beyond emission performance standards with three distinct compliance periods within that timeframe states were originally required to submit their plans to epa by september 2016 with an optional twoyear extension provided to

states establishing a need for additional time however it is expected that this timing will be impacted by the courtimposed stay described below 

adeq with input from a technical working group comprised of arizona utilities and other stakeholders is presently working to develop a compliance plan for submittal to epa in addition to these ongoing state proceedings epa has taken public comments on proposed model rules and a proposed federal compliance plan which included consideration as to how the clean power plan will apply to egus on tribal land such as the navajo nation 

the legality of the clean power plan is being challenged in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the parties raising this challenge include among others the acc on february 9 2016 the us supreme court granted a stay of the clean power plan pending judicial review of the rule which temporarily delays compliance obligations under the clean power plan we cannot predict the extent of such delay 

with respect to our arizona generating units we are currently evaluating the range of compliance options available to adeq including whether arizona deploys a rate or massbased compliance plan based on the fuelmix and location of our arizona egus and the significant investments we have made in renewable generation and demandside energy efficiency if adeq selects a ratebased compliance plan we believe that we will be able to comply with the clean power plan for our arizona generating units in a manner that will not have material financial or operational impacts to the company on the other hand if adeq selects a massbased approach to compliance with the clean power plan our annual cost of compliance could be material these costs could include costs to acquire massbased compliance allowances 

as to our facilities on the navajo nation epa has yet to determine whether or to what extent egus on the navajo nation will be required to comply with the clean power plan epa has proposed to determine that it is necessary or appropriate to impose a federal plan on the navajo nation for compliance with the clean power plan in response we filed comments with epa advocating that such a federal plan is neither necessary nor appropriate to protect air quality on the navajo nation if epa reaches a determination that is consistent with our preferred approach for the navajo nation we believe the clean power plan will not have material financial or operational impacts on our operations within the navajo nation 

alternatively if epa determines that a federal plan is necessary or appropriate for the navajo nation and depending on our need for future operations at our egus located there we may be unable to comply with the federal plan unless we acquire massbased allowances or emission rate credits within established carbon trading markets or curtail our operations subject to the uncertainties set forth below and assuming that epa establishes a federal plan for the navajo nation that requires carbon allowances or credits to be surrendered for plan compliance it is possible we will be required to purchase some quantity of credits or allowances the cost of which could be material 

because adeq has not issued its plan for arizona and because we do not know whether epa will decide to impose a plan or if so what that plan will require there are a number of uncertainties associated with our potential cost exposure these uncertainties include whether judicial review will result in the clean power plan being vacated in whole or in part or if not the extent of any resulting compliance deadline delays whether any plan will be imposed for egus on the navajo nation the future existence and liquidity of allowance or credit compliance trading markets the applicability of existing contractual obligations with current and former owners of our participantowned coalfired egus the type of federal or state compliance plan either rate or massbased whether or not the trading of allowances or credits will be authorized mechanisms for compliance with any final epa or adeq plan and how units that have been closed will be treated for allowance or credit allocation purposes 

table of contents 

in the event that the incurrence of compliance costs is not economically viable or prudent for our operations in arizona or on the navajo nation or if we do not have the option of acquiring allowances to account for the emissions from our operations we may explore other options including reduced levels of output as an alternative to purchasing allowances given these uncertainties our analysis of the available compliance options remains ongoing and additional information or considerations may arise that change our expectations 

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives that address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning  current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biogas and biomass and we expect the percentage of renewable energy in our resource portfolio to increase over the coming years 

aps prepares an inventory of ghg emissions from its operations this inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program and is voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report 

  

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules    in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with epa’s final bart determinations and cholla’s obligations to comply with adeq’s and epa’s determinations coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

cholla in 2007 adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq in early 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart adeq reviewed aps’s recommendations and submitted its proposed bart state implementation plan “sip” for cholla and other sources in arizona in early 2011 

on december 5 2012 epa issued a final bart rule applicable to cholla epa approved adeq’s bart emissions limits for sulfur dioxide “so 2 ” and emissions of particulate matter “pm” but added a so 2  removal efficiency requirement of 95 in addition epa disapproved adeq’s bart determinations for oxides of nitrogen “no x ” and promulgated a federal implementation plan fip establishing a new more stringent “bubbled” no x  emission rate applicable to the two barteligible cholla units owned by aps and the other barteligible unit owned by pacificorp 

aps believes that epa’s final rule as it applies to cholla which would require installation of scr controls with a cost to aps of approximately 100 million excludes costs related to cholla unit 2 which was 

table of contents 

closed on october 1 2015 is unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s sip and promulgating a fip that is inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program accordingly on february 1 2013 aps filed a petition for review of the final bart rule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit briefing in the case was completed in february 2014 

in september 2014 aps met with epa to propose a compromise bart strategy wherein pending certain regulatory approvals aps would permanently close cholla unit 2 which occurred on october 1 2015 and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset aps made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment is unlikely to be required in the future because retiring andor converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more cost effective than and will result in increased visibility improvement over the current bart requirements for nox imposed on the cholla units under epas bart fip aps’s proposal involves state and federal rulemaking processes in light of these ongoing administrative proceedings on february 19 2015 aps pacificorp owner of cholla unit 4 and epa jointly moved the court to sever and hold in abeyance those claims in the litigation pertaining to cholla pending regulatory actions by the state and epa the court granted the parties unopposed motion on february 20 2015 on october 16 2015 adeq issued the cholla permit which incorporates apss proposal and subsequently submitted a proposed revision to the sip to the epa which would incorporate the new permit terms aps is unable to predict when or whether apss proposal may ultimately be approved by the epa 

four corners  on august 6 2012 epa issued its final bart determination for four corners which requires aps to install and operate scr control technology on units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 aps retired four corners units 13 on december 30 2013 aps estimates that its 63 share of the cost of these controls for four corners units 4 and 5 would be approximately 400 million in addition aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el pasos 7 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july 2016 in december 2015 ntec notified aps of its intention to exercise its option to acquire the 7 interest from aps the cost of the controls related to the 7 interest is approximately 45 million which will be assumed by the ultimate owner of the 7 interest 

navajo plant  on january 18 2013 epa issued a proposed bart rule for the navajo plant which would require installation of scr technology in order to achieve a new more stringent plantwide no x  emission limit in addition epa proposed a “better than bart” alternative and solicited comment on other options that could set longer time frames for installing pollution controls if the navajo plant can achieve additional emission reductions on july 26 2013 a group of stakeholders including srp the operating agent for the navajo plant submitted to epa two suggested alternatives to bart which would achieve greater no x  emission reductions and result in greater reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal than epa’s proposed bart determination on july 28 2014 epa issued a final navajo plant bart rule approving the alternative stakeholder plan depending on which alternate operating scenario the navajo plant participants ultimately select the required no x  emission reductions could be achieved by either closing one of the three 750 mw units at the plant or curtailing energy production across all three units such that the emission reductions are commensurate with the closure of approximately one of the navajo plant units aps estimates that its share of costs for upgrades at the navajo plant based on epas fip could be up to approximately 200 million in october 2014 a coalition of environmental groups an indian tribe and others filed petitions for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit asking the court to review epa’s final bart rule for the navajo plant we cannot predict the outcome of this petition 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants    in 2011 epa issued rules establishing maximum achievable control technology standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired plants aps estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately 8 million for cholla excluding costs related to cholla unit 2 which was closed 

table of contents 

on october 1 2015 no additional equipment is needed for four corners units 4 and 5 to comply with these rules srp the operating agent for the navajo plant estimates that apss share of costs for equipment necessary to comply with the rules is approximately 1 million the united states supreme court’s recent decision in michigan vs epa  reversed and remanded the mats proceeding back to the dc circuit court the circuit court then remanded the mats rule back to epa to address rulemaking deficiencies identified by the supreme court further epa action on the mats rule is pending this proceeding does not materially impact aps regardless of how epa addresses the deficiencies in the mats rulemaking the arizona state mercury rule the stringency of which is roughly equivalent to that of mats would still apply to cholla 

coal combustion waste   on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals “ccr” such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent’s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity 

because the subtitle d rule is selfimplementing the ccr standards apply directly to the regulated facility and facilities are directly responsible for ensuring that their operations comply with the rule’s requirements while epa has chosen to regulate the disposal of ccr in landfills and surface impoundments as nonhazardous waste under the final rule the agency makes clear that it will continue to evaluate any risks associated with ccr disposal and leaves open the possibility that it may regulate ccr as a hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c in the future 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 15 million and its share of incremental costs for cholla is approximately 85 million the navajo plant currently disposes of ccr in a dry landfill storage area aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for the navajo plant is approximately 1 million 

effluent limitation guidelines   on september 30 2015 epa finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and coal ash disposal leachate based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate compliance with these limitations will be required in connection with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes discharge permit renewals which occur in fiveyear intervals that arise between 2018 and 2023 until a draft npdes permit for four corners is proposed during that timeframe we are uncertain what will be required to control these discharges in compliance with the finalized effluent limitations at that facility cholla and the navajo plant do not require npdes permitting 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on october 1 2015 epa finalized revisions to the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” at a level of 70 parts per billion “ppb” with ozone standards becoming more stringent our fossil generation units will come under 

table of contents 

increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas epa is expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by october 1 2017 depending on when epa approves attainment designations for the arizona and navajo nation jurisdictions in which our fossil generation units are located revisions to sips and fips respectively implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard are expected to be in place between 2020 and 2021 at this time because proposed sips and fips implementing the revised ozone naaqss have yet to be released aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting aps 

clean air act citizen lawsuit    on october 4 2011 earthjustice on behalf of several environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico against aps and the other four corners participants alleging violations of the nsr provisions of the clean air act subsequent to filing its original complaint on january 6 2012 earthjustice filed a first amended complaint adding claims for violations of the clean air act’s new source performance standards nsps program the case was held in abeyance while aps negotiated a settlement with doj and environmental plaintiffs in march 2015 the parties agreed in principle to settle the case and on june 24 2015 doj lodged the proposed consent decree with the united states district court for the district of new mexico on august 17 2015 the consent decree was entered by the district court 

the settlement requires installation of pollution control technology and implementation of other measures to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from the two four corners units although installation of much of this equipment was already planned in order to comply with epas regional haze rule requirements the settlement also requires the four corners coowners to pay a civil penalty of 15 million and spend 67 million for certain environmental mitigation projects to benefit the navajo nation aps is responsible for 15 percent of these costs based on its ownership interest in the units at the time of the alleged violations which does not result in a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties prps prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 2 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district rid filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area on january 25 2015 adeq sent a letter to aps seeking information concerning the degree to which if any aps’s current and former ownership of these

facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters however we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant   sites    certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations 

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over aps’s groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

little colorado river adjudication   aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances 

aps is currently pursuing certain activities such as microgrid investments and construction of renewable facilities intended for specific customers to date aps has not received regulatory assurance of cost  recovery for such investments as aps engages in these activities we will have to demonstrate to regulators that these investments are both prudent and useful in providing electric service to customers 

the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 

in a recent appellate challenge to an acc rate decision regarding a water company referred to in note 3 as sib the arizona court of appeals considered the question of how the acc should determine the “fair value” of a utility’s property as specified in the arizona constitution in connection with authorizing the recovery of costs through rate adjustors or surcharges outside of a rate case the court of appeals reversed the acc’s method of finding fair value in that case and raised questions concerning the relationship between fair value findings and the recovery of capital and certain other utility costs through adjustors the acc sought review by the arizona supreme court of this decision and aps filed a brief supporting the acc’s petition to the arizona supreme court for review of the court of appeals’ decision on february 9 2016 the arizona supreme court granted review of the decision and oral argument is set for march 22 2016 if the decision is upheld by the supreme court without modification certain aps rate adjustors may require modification this could in turn have an impact on aps’s ability to recover certain costs in between rate cases aps cannot predict the outcome of this matter 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

on january 28 2016 an acc commissioner robert l burns sent aps a notice of investigation pursuant to an arizona statute that authorizes a commissioner and his agents to inspect the accounts books papers and documents of any public service corporation and examine under oath any officer agent or employee of such corporation in relation to the business and affairs of the corporation the notice states that commissioner burns intends to investigate whether aps has used funds recoverable from ratepayers for political contributions lobbying or charitable donations purposes whether aps’s corporate affiliates have made contributions or donations under aps’ brand name and the degree to which aps and pinnacle west are “intertwined” in terms of organization management and operations aps intends to cooperate with this investigation to the full extent that the matter is   lawfully authorized but cannot predict its timing or outcome 

  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities including palo verde as a result of the march 2011 earthquake and tsunamis that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan various industry organizations analyzed information from the japan incident and develop action plans for us nuclear power plants additionally the nrc performed its own independent review of the events at fukushima daiichi including a review of the agency’s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency

should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the nrc’s system of regulation as a result of the fukushima event the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to implement the first tier recommendations of the nrc’s near term task force in response to these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 05 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next year in addition to the approximate 125 million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december 31 2015 aps’s share is 291 we cannot predict whether these amounts will increase or whether additional financial andor operational requirements on palo verde and aps may be imposed 

  

in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up  aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

  

regional haze   aps has received final rulemakings imposing new requirements on four corners cholla and the navajo plant pursuant to these rules epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes bart to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

coal ash   in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and in a dry landfill storage area at the navajo plant to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps would incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal

ozone national ambient air quality standards   in 2015 epa finalized revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides which set new more stringent standards intended to protect human health and human welfare depending on the stringency of the final standards and the implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas    

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate effects and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co2 which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

financial risks  greenhouse gas regulation and the clean power plan   in  2015 epa finalized a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where aps operates could result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company see note 10 for additional risks and uncertainties resulting from the clean power plan 

physical and operational risks    weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority 

table of contents 

before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition 

one of these options would be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generation  1 program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation on november 25 2015 the acc issued an order approving a request by several ag1 customers and suppliers to extend the term of the program from july 1 2016 to the conclusion of apss next general rate case the order also authorized aps to defer for future recovery unmitigated unrecovered costs attributable to the program at 90 of the first 10 million per year and at 100 of amounts above 10 million per year 

  

in 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc the use of such products by customers within our territory results in some level of competition aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional service providers will enter aps’s service territory increasing the level of competition in the market 

proposals to enable or support retail electric competition are made from time to time in legislative or other forums in arizona we cannot predict future regulatory or legislative action that might result in increased competition 

  

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the settlement agreement in aps’s most recent retail rate case the “2012 settlement agreement” includes a mechanism the lfcr to address these matters 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small 

table of contents 

scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

customer and sales growth  for the three years 2013 through 2015 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 13 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of 2030 for 2016 through 2018 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona for the three years 2013 through 2015 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2016 through 2018 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if it declines or if the arizona economy fails to improve we may be unable to reach our estimated demand level and sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses concerns over physical security of these assets is also increasing which may require us to incur additional capital and operating costs to address damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects 

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain certain regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic questions related to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements such as the ees and the res the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including risks related to financing siting permitting technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources 

table of contents 

aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks   and risks of unauthorized access to our systems 

  

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including confidential customer employee financial or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access our generation transmission and distribution facilities information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of our operating systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the increasing promulgation of nerc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and attempted intrusions the implementation of additional security measures could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect pinnacle west’s and aps’s reputation with customers and the public 

table of contents 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcome of pending and future approvals by applicable governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 19 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 111 million but not more than 166 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

table of contents 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

aps continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s business 

deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources these trends which have benefited from historical and continuing government subsidies for certain technologies have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make apss existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and longterm viability 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 36 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2018 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

table of contents 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy financial regulation or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

• causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

• increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

   

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other 

table of contents 

postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise most of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions have been implemented however costs and other effects of the legislation which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly owned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

 

table of contents 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

   

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2015 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

see “business of arizona public service company” in item 1 for a map detailing the location of aps’s major power plants and principal transmission lines 

  

transmission and distribution facilities 

  

current facilities    aps’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 6070 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5847 miles of which are located in arizona aps’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11077 miles of overhead lines and approximately 18071 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps distribution facilities reflect an actual net gain of 169 miles in 2015 aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015 



  

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2015 plan aps projects it will develop 275 miles of new lines over the next ten years one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the palo verde to morgan system includes palo verdedelaneysun valleymorgan the project consists of four phases the first phase morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv is currently inservice the second 

table of contents 

and third phases delaney to palo verde 500kv and delaney to sun valley 500kv are under construction and are expected to be energized by may 2016 the fourth phase morgan to sun valley 500kv has been permitted and is in final design and development in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed with the capability to string a 230kv line as a second circuit 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’s 2015 transmission plan are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california the north gila to hassayampa line went into service in may 2015 

physical security standards on july 14 2015 ferc approved version 2 of the proposed physical security reliability standard cip014 cip0142 as a result cip0142 the physical security reliability standard that requires transmission owners and operators to protect those critical transmission stations and substations and their associated primary control centers that if rendered inoperable or damaged as a result of a physical attack could result in widespread instability uncontrolled separation or cascading within an interconnection became effective on october 2 2015 triggering a series of staggered but interdependent obligations for aps as required by the physical security reliability standard aps determined its critical transmission stations and substations and associated primary control centers that will be required to comply with the standard by october 2 2015 however as contemplated under cip0142 this verification has triggered additional requirements and obligations within the physical security reliability standard that are not yet due to be completed these remaining obligations which consist of a risk evaluation and development and verification of a physical security plan are due to be completed by the end the third quarter of 2016 until aps has completed all required activities under the physical security reliability standard we cannot predict the extent of any financial or operational impacts on aps 

nerc critical infrastructure protection requirements in 2014 aps initiated a comprehensive project to ensure compliance with version 5 of nercs critical infrastructure protection requirements cip v5 which will become effective april 1 2016 aps will be incurring incremental capital expenditures through 2017 associated with the cip v5 compliance implementation project estimated to be approximately 52 million 

  

plant and transmission line leases and rightsofway on indian lands 

  

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under rightsofway from the federal government the rightofway and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the rightofway and lease for four corners were scheduled to expire in 2016 in march 2011 the navajo nation council signed a resolution approving a 25year extension to the existing four corners lease term and providing navajo nation consent to renewal of the related rightsofway the effectiveness of the lease amendment also required the approval of the doi as did the related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record of decision on july 17 2015 the record of decision provides the authority for the bureau of indian affairs to sign the lease amendments and rightsofway renewals which occurred in late july 2015 

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes or federal agencies other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe or federal agencies will be required at that time in recent negotiations certain of the affected indian tribes have

required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway the ultimate cost of renewal of certain of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is therefore uncertain

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis 

of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

overview 

  

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps currently accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings 

  

areas of business focus 

  

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

  

nuclear   aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde the march 2011 earthquake and tsunamis in japan and the resulting accident at japan’s fukushima daiichi nuclear power station had a significant impact on nuclear power operators worldwide in the aftermath of the accident the nrc conducted an independent assessment to consider actions to address lessons learned from the fukushima events the independent assessment named the near term task force recommended a number of proposed enhancements to us commercial nuclear power plant equipment and emergency plans the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to begin implementing some of the near term task force’s recommendations to implement these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 05 million for capital enhancements to the plant through 2016 in addition to the approximate 125 million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december 31 2015 aps’s share is 291 

  

coal and related environmental matters and transactions   aps is a joint owner of three coalfired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning ghg emissions on june 2 2014 epa proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the clean power plan and epa finalized its proposal on august 3 2015 

epa’s nationwide co 2  emissions reduction goal is 32 below 2005 emission levels as finalized for the state of arizona and the navajo nation compliance with the clean power plan could involve a shift in generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation until implementation plans for these jurisdictions are finalized we are unable to determine the actual impacts to aps aps continually analyzes its longrange capital management plans to assess the potential effects of these changes understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to continue participation in such plants

cholla 

on september 11 2014 aps announced that it would close its 260 mw unit 2 at cholla and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april 14 2015 the acc approved apss plan to retire unit 2 without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and note 10 for details of the proposal aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the long term than the benefits that would have resulted from adding emissions control equipment aps closed unit 2 on october 1 2015 

four corners 

  

asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters   on december 30 2013 aps purchased sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million in connection with aps’s most recent retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis on february 23 2015 the acc decision approving the rate adjustments was appealed aps has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding the arizona court of appeals has suspended the appeal pending the arizona supreme courts decision in the sib matter discussed below which could have an effect on the outcome of this four corners proceeding we cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved 

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed the 2016 coal supply agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 when the current coal supply agreement expires through 2031 el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the cash purchase price which will be subject to certain adjustments at closing is immaterial in amount and the purchaser will assume el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july 2016 

when aps or an affiliate of aps ultimately acquires el pasos interest in four corners ntec has the option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec on december 29 2015 ntec notified aps of its intent to exercise the option aps is negotiating a definitive purchase agreement with ntec for the purchase of the 7 interest the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest 

lease extension   aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rightsofway grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record

of decision on july 17 2015 the record of decision provided the authority for the bureau of indian affairs to sign the lease amendments and rightsofway renewals which occurred in late july 2015 on december 21 2015 several environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue with osm and other federal agencies under the endangered species act alleging that osms reliance on the biological opinion and incidental take statement prepared in connection with the environmental review described above were not in accordance with applicable law we are monitoring this matter and will intervene if a lawsuit is filed we cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter 

  

natural gas  aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona including ocotillo ocotillo is a 330 mw 4unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw with completion targeted by summer 2019 aps completed a competitive solicitation process in which the ocotillo project was evaluated against other alternatives consistent with the independent monitor’s report the ocotillo project was selected as the best alternative aps must finalize the permitting process before construction can begin 

transmission and delivery   aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that continue to support system reliability access to markets and renewable energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the liquidity and capital resources section below includes new aps transmission projects through 2018 along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

  

renewable energy    the acc approved the res in 2006 the renewable energy requirement is 6 of retail electric sales in 2016 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in the 2009 settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to use aps’s best efforts to obtain 1700 gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment and res target for 2015 a component of the res targets development of distributed energy systems 

in 2013 the acc conducted a hearing to consider apss proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits on february 6 2014 the acc established a proceeding to modify the renewable energy rules to establish a process for compliance with the renewable energy requirement that is not based solely on the use of renewable energy credits on september 9 2014 the acc authorized a rulemaking process to modify the res rules the proposed changes would permit the acc to find that utilities have complied with the distributed energy requirement in light of all available information the acc adopted these changes on december 18 2014 the revised rules went into effect on april 21 2015 

  

on july 1 2014 aps filed its 2015 res implementation plan and proposed a res budget of approximately 154 million on december 31 2014 the acc issued a decision approving the 2015 res implementation plan with minor modifications including reducing the requested budget to approximately 152 million

aps has developed owned solar resources through the accapproved az sun program aps has invested approximately 675 million in its az sun program agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid 

  

in accordance with the acc’s decision on the 2014 res plan on april 15 2014 aps filed an application with the acc requesting permission to build an additional 20 mw of apsowned utility scale solar under the az sun program in a subsequent filing aps also offered an alternative proposal to replace the 20 mw of utility scale solar with 10 mw approximately 1500 customers of apsowned residential solar that will not be under the az sun program on december 19 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing its residential rooftop solar program the first stage of the residential rooftop solar program called the solar partner program is to be 8 mw followed by a 2 mw second stage that will only be deployed if coupled with distributed storage the program will target specific distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as make systems available to limitedincome customers who cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties the acc expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes shall not be made until the project is fully in service and aps requests cost recovery in a future rate case 

demand side management  in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this standard became effective on january 1 2011 

  

on june 1 2012 aps filed its 2013 dsm plan in 2013 the standards required aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to 5 of its 2012 retail energy sales later in 2012 aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for 2013 of 876 million 

  

on march 11 2014 the acc issued an order approving aps’s 2013 dsm plan the acc approved a budget of 689 million for each of 2013 and 2014 the acc also approved a resource savings initiative that allows aps to count towards compliance with the acc electric energy efficiency standards savings from improvements to aps’s transmission and delivery system generation and facilities that have been approved through a dsm plan 

  

on march 20 2015 aps filed an application with the acc requesting a budget of 689 million for 2015 and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio going forward including for the first time three resource savings projects which reflect energy savings on apss system the acc approved aps’s 2015 dsm budget on november 25 2015 in its decision the acc also approved that verified energy savings from aps’s resource savings projects could be counted toward compliance with the electric energy efficiency standard however the acc ruled that aps was not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of its achievement tier level for its performance incentive nor may aps include savings from conservation voltage reduction in the calculation of its lost fixed cost recovery mechanism 

on june 1 2015 aps filed its 2016 dsm plan requesting a budget of 689 million and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio to increase energy savings and cost effectiveness of the programs the dsm plan also proposed a reduction in the dsmac of approximately 12

electric energy efficiency on june 27 2013 the acc voted to open a new docket investigating whether the electric energy efficiency standards should be modified the acc held a series of three workshops in march and april 2014 to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs cost recovery mechanisms incentives and potential changes to the electric energy efficiency and resource planning rules 

on november 4 2014 the acc staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to arizona’s electric utility energy efficiency standards the draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards the acc accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on december 19 2014 a formal rulemaking has not been initiated and there has been no additional action on the draft to date 

  

rate matters   aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by ferc on june 1 2011 aps filed a rate case with the acc aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into the 2012 settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case see note 3 for details regarding the 2012 settlement agreement terms and for information on aps’s ferc rates 

on january 29 2016 aps filed a noi informing the acc that aps intends to submit a rate case application in june 2016 using an adjusted test year ending december 31 2015 the noi provides an overview of the key issues aps expects to address in its formal request such as rate design changes residential commercial and industrial a decoupling mechanism permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with the company’s ocotillo modernization project permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with environmental standards compliance inclusion of posttest year plant and modifications to certain adjustor mechanisms among other items in its rate application aps will request that its proposed pricing changes take effect in july 2017 aps is still developing the exact amount of the request 

  

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

  

as part of aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 of four corners aps and sce agreed via a transmission termination agreement that upon closing of the acquisition the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement transmission agreement between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system the arizona transmission system for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps previously submitted a request to ferc related to this termination which resulted in a ferc order denying rate recovery of 40 million that aps agreed to pay sce associated with the termination aps and sce negotiated an alternate arrangement under which sce would assign its 1555 mw capacity rights over the arizona transmission system to third parties including 300 mw to aps’s marketing and trading group however this alternative arrangement was not approved by ferc on december 22 2015 aps and sce agreed to terminate the transmission termination agreement and allow for the transmission agreement to expire according to its terms which includes settling obligations in accordance with the terms of the transmission agreement aps has established a regulatory asset of 12 million at december 31 2015 in connection with the expiration of the transmission agreement which it expects to recover through its fercjurisdictional rates

net metering   on july 12 2013 aps filed an application with the acc proposing a solution to address the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules on december 3 2013 the acc issued its order on aps’s net metering proposal the acc instituted a charge on customers who install rooftop solar panels after december 31 2013 the charge of 070 per kilowatt became effective on january 1 2014 and is estimated to collect 490 per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electric grid the fixed charge does not increase apss revenue because it is credited to the lfcr 

in making its decision the acc determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift causing nonsolar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electric grid the acc acknowledged that the 070 per kilowatt charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift 

on october 20 2015 the acc voted to conduct a generic evidentiary hearing on the value and cost of distributed generation to gather information that will inform the acc on net metering issues and cost of service studies in upcoming utility rate cases a hearing has been scheduled to commence in april 2016 aps cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 

in 2015 arizona jurisdictional utilities uns electric inc and tucson electric power company both filed applications with the acc requesting rate increases these applications include rate design changes to mitigate the cost shift caused by net metering on december 9 2015 aps filed testimony in the uns electric inc rate case in support of the uns electric inc proposed rate design changes aps has also requested intervention in the upcoming tucson electric power company rate case the outcomes of these proceedings will not directly impact our financial position 

appellate review of thirdparty regulatory decision system improvement benefits or sib in a recent appellate challenge to an acc rate decision involving a water company the arizona court of appeals considered the question of how the acc should determine the “fair value” of a utility’s property as specified in the arizona constitution in connection with authorizing the recovery of costs through rate adjustors outside of a rate case the court of appeals reversed the acc’s method of finding fair value in that case and raised questions concerning the relationship between the need for fair value findings and the recovery of capital and certain other utility costs through adjustors the acc sought review by the arizona supreme court of this decision and aps filed a brief supporting the acc’s petition to the arizona supreme court for review of the court of appeals’ decision on february 9 2016 the arizona supreme court granted review of the decision and oral argument is set for march 22 2016 if the decision is upheld by the supreme court without modification certain aps rate adjustors may require modification this could in turn have an impact on aps’s ability to recover certain costs in between rate cases aps cannot predict the outcome of this matter 

financial strength and flexibility   pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  

other subsidiaries 

bright canyon energy on july 31 2014 pinnacle west announced its creation of a whollyowned subsidiary bce bce will focus on new growth opportunities that leverage the company’s core expertise in the electric energy industry bce’s first initiative is a 5050 joint venture with bhe us transmission llc a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway energy company the joint venture named transcanyon is pursuing independent transmission opportunities within the eleven states that comprise the western electricity coordinating council excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates transcanyon

continues to pursue transmission development opportunities in the western united states consistent with its strategy 

el dorado   the operations of el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years 

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2013 through 2015 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

customer and sales growth  retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 12 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared with the prior year for the three years 2013 through 2015 aps’s customer growth averaged 13 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of 2030 for 2016 through 2018 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 07 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared with the prior year reflecting the effects of improving economic conditions and customer growth partially offset by customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years 2013 through 2015 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2016 through 2018 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy could further impact these estimates 

  

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million

operations and maintenance expenses   operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors on september 30 2014 pinnacle west announced plan design changes to the group life and medical postretirement benefit plan which reduced net periodic benefit costs see note 7 

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see capital expenditures below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities see note 3 regarding deferral of certain costs pursuant to an acc order 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 110 of the assessed value for 2015 107 for 2014 and 105 for 2013 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units transmission and distribution facilities see note 3 for property tax deferrals contained in the 2012 settlement agreement 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2015 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 55 its total shareholder equity was approximately 47 billion and total capitalization was approximately 86 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 34 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west 

many of aps’s current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation on december 18 2015 president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act 2016 hr 2029 which combined the tax and government funding bills the protecting americans from tax hikes act and omnibus bill containing an extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 enactment of this legislation is expected to generate approximately 375425 million of cash tax benefits over the next three years which is expected to be fully realized by aps and pinnacle west consolidated during this time frame the cash generated by the extension of bonus depreciation is an acceleration of the tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over 20 years at pinnacle west consolidated the extension of bonus depreciation will in turn delay until 2019 full cash realization of approximately 82 million of currently unrealized investment tax credits which are recorded as a deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2015 the ratio was approximately 47 for pinnacle west and 46 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of crossdefault provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements and term loan facilities contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings

this table excludes 34 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain estimated minimum required pension contributions are zero for 2016 2017 and 2018 see note 7 

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

table of contents 

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 1364 million of regulatory assets and 1140 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2015 is a regulatory asset of 619 million for pension benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2015 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2015 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

see note 7 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion on accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures 

other accounting matters 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we early adopted two new accounting standards related to balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs and balance sheet presentation of deferred income taxes the adoption of these standards did not impact our results of operations or cash flows 

during the first quarter of 2016 we will be adopting new consolidation accounting guidance we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents 

we are currently evaluating the impacts of adopting new revenue recognition guidance and financial instrument recognition and measurement guidance these two new accounting standards will be effective for us on january 1 2018

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 when the current coal supply agreement expires through 2031 the “2016 coal supply agreement” el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the cash purchase price which will be subject to certain adjustments at closing is immaterial in amount and the purchaser will assume el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july 2016 

when aps or an affiliate of aps ultimately acquires el pasos interest in four corners ntec will have an option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not exercise its option 

  

the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants are pursuing a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process in march 2014 aps received a draft of the environmental impact statement deis in connection with the doi review process as a proponent of four corners and the navajo mine energy project aps along with other members of the public submitted comments on the deis aps cannot predict whether these federal approvals will be granted and if so on a timely basis or whether any conditions that may be attached to them will be acceptable to the four corners owners on december 19 2014 aps obtained a prevention of significant deterioration “psd” permit from epa allowing aps to install selective catalytic reduction “scr” control technology at four corners as described below under “environmental matters — epa environmental regulation”

nuclear 

  palo verde nuclear generating station —  palo verde is a 3unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and approximately 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases approximately 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

  

palo verde leases —  in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities the agreements expire at the end of 2015 and contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms on july 7 2014 aps notified the lessor trust entities of aps’s intent to exercise the fixed rate lease renewal options the length of the renewal options will result in aps retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases at the end of the lease renewal periods aps will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value extend the leases for up to two years or return the assets to the lessors see note 18 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses  — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle —  the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

• mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

• conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

• enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

• fabrication of fuel assemblies 

• utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

• storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2018 and 45 of its requirements in 20192020 the

participants have also contracted for 100 of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2020 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2022 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal —  the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated 

by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 aps is directly and indirectly involved in several legal proceedings related to doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract  — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a lawsuit against doe in the us court of federal claims for damages incurred due to doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded 302 million in damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe this lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to doe’s failure to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 on august 18 2014 aps and doe entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment of 574 million by doe to the palo verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by palo verde during the period january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 aps’s share of this amount is 167 million amounts recovered in the lawsuit and settlement were recorded as adjustments to regulatory liability and had no impact on current income 

the onemill fee  — in 2011 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners and the nuclear energy institute challenged doe’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kwh fee the “onemill fee” paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the standard contract this fee is recovered by aps in its retail rates in june 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” held that doe failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination the dc circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the secretary of the doe “secretary” with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months in february 2013 upon completion of doe’s revised onemill fee adequacy determination the dc circuit reopened the proceedings on november 19 2013 the dc circuit ordered the secretary to notify congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators as he is required to do pursuant to the nwpa and the dc circuit’s order on january 3 2014 the secretary notified congress of his intention to suspend collection of the onemill fee subject to congress’ disapproval on may 16 2014 the doe notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators who are party to a standard contract that it reduced the onemill fee to zero thus effectively terminating the onemill fee 

  

doe’s construction authorization application for yucca mountain  — the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several interested parties have also intervened in the nrc proceeding additionally a number of interested parties filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application and nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain 

table of contents 

construction authorization application the cases have been consolidated into one matter at the dc circuit in august 2013 the dc circuit ordered the nrc to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds 

on october 16 2014 the nrc issued volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure and its issuance is a key milestone in the yucca mountain licensing process volume 3 contains the staff’s finding that the doe’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed including but not limited to the postclosure performance objectives in nrc’s regulations 

on december 18 2014 the nrc issued volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the yucca mountain construction authorization application this volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository it documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the doe’s research and development and performance confirmation programs as well as other administrative controls and systems meet applicable nrc requirements volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in nrc regulations are met except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights 

publication of volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the nrc might authorize construction of the repository 

  

waste confidence  — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and 

permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s 2010 waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with the national environmental policy act “nepa” requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the 2010 waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision the nrc commissioners also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of september 6 2012 

in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft generic environmental impact statement “geis” to support an updated waste confidence decision on august 26 2014 the nrc approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel the continued storage rule adopted the findings of the geis regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations as a result those generic impacts do not need to be reanalyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses although palo verde had not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the dc circuit’s june 8 2012 decision the nrc lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the dc circuit issued its june 2012 decision the august 26th final rule has been subject to continuing legal challenges before the nrc and the court of appeals

impact of earthquake and tsunami in japan on nuclear energy industry  — on march 11 2011 an earthquake measuring 90 on the richter scale occurred off the coast of japan causing a series of seven tsunamis as a result the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station experienced damage 

following the earthquake and tsunamis the nrc established a task force to conduct a systematic and methodical review of nrc processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system on march 12 2012 the nrc issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the near term task force with respect to palo verde the nrc issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding 1 mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at the plant and 2 enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation 

  

the nrc has issued a number of guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements due to the developing nature of these requirements we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impacts on palo verde or aps however to implement these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 40 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next two years in addition to the approximate 80 million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december 31 2014 aps’s share is 291 

  

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near palo verde ocotillo located in tempe discussed below sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oilonly power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oilonly combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3179 mw gas for these plants is financially hedged up to three years in advance of purchasing and the gas is generally purchased one month prior to delivery aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck 

  

table of contents 

ocotillo is a 330 mw 4unit gas plant in early 2014 aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw with completion targeted for summer 2018 the last milestone before construction begins was raised during the accs integrated resource planning meeting in the fall of 2014 while there was support for the first 2 units which replace the existing steam units questions were raised on the cost effectiveness for the additional three units to address these matters aps issued a request for proposal in late january 2015 for the incremental capacity equivalent to 3 of the 5 units 

  

solar facilities 

to date aps has begun operation of 150 mw of utility scale solar through its az sun program discussed below these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona 

  

additionally aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona additionally aps owns 12 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

in december 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing a 10 mwdc approximately 85 mwac residential rooftop program the first stage of the residential rooftop solar program is to be 8 mw followed by a 2 mw second stage that will only be deployed if coupled with distributed storage under this program aps will own operate and maintain approximately 1500 residential systems the program will target specific distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as make systems available to limitedincome customers who cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties 

  

purchased power contracts 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 16 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability 

  

purchased power capacity —  aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts including its renewable energy portfolio is summarized in the table below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted

 current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2014 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 23 2014 at 7007 mw compared to the 2013 peak of 6927 mw recorded on july 8 2013 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2014 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 34 excluding certain contractual rights to call on additional capacity on short notice which aps may use in the event of unusual weather or unplanned outages the 2014 reserve margin was 24 aps anticipates the reserve margin for 2015 will be approximately 33 or 23 excluding contractual rights to call on additional capacity aps expects that our reserve margins will decrease over the next three years and that additional conventional resources will be needed around 2017 

  

future resources and resource plan 

under the acc’s resource planning rule aps will file by april 1 of each evennumbered year its resource plans for the next fifteenyear period the rule requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal the acc’s acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of electric energy services demand management analysis of supplyside options system reliability and risk management aps filed its 2014 resource plan on april 1 2014 and it will be filing its next resource plan by april 1 2016 the acc staff is exploring potential ways to improve the resource plan process 

after considering the costs to comply with environmental regulations on september 11 2014 aps announced that it will close cholla unit 2 by april 2016 and cease burning coal at the other apsowned units units 1 and 3 at the plant by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules aps filed an amendment to its resource plan with the acc to request approval of the retirement of cholla unit 2 the acc has not yet made a decision on this amendment previously aps estimated cholla unit 2’s end of life to be 2033 aps is currently recovering

depreciation and a return on the net book value of the unit in base rates and plans to seek recovery of all of the unit’s retirementrelated costs in its next retail rate case if aps closes cholla unit 2 aps believes it will be allowed recovery of the remaining net book value of unit 2  128 million  as of december 31 2014 in addition to a return on its investment in accordance with gaap in the third quarter of 2014 unit 2’s remaining net book value was reclassified from property plant and equipment to a regulatory asset if the acc does not allow full recovery of the remaining net book value of cholla unit 2 all or a portion of the regulatory asset will be written off and aps’s net income cash flows and financial position will be negatively impacted 

  

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 5 of retail electric sales in 2015 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be approximately 12 of retail sales by yearend 2015 which is more than double the res target of 5 for that year a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties such as rooftop solar systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 5 in 2015 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

  



renewable energy portfolio  to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1253 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 1194 mw are currently in operation and 59 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 169 mw of facilities owned by aps 629 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 396 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps aps is developing owned solar resources through the az sun program under this program to date aps estimates its investment commitment will be approximately 674 million see note 3 for additional details about the az sun program

demand side management 

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard “ees” of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations 

  

government awards 

  

through various doe initiatives the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs aps continues its work on a 3 million financial award for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff arizona this award will conclude during 2015 and is contingent upon aps meeting certain project milestones including doeestablished budget parameters 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model use of such products by customers within our territory results in an increasing level of competition aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers 

table of contents 

although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service territory in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers in 2000 the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals’ decision 

  

in 2008 the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals’ decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august 12 2010 the report stated that additional analysis discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another is currently scheduled for february 26 2015 

  

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2014 approximately 73 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio

environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative initiatives there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and it is unclear if and when the 114 th  congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

regulatory initiatives   in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that ghgs fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result epa has the authority to regulate ghg emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants epa issued a rule under the clean air act known as the “tailoring rule” establishing new ghg emission thresholds that determine when sources including power plants must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits “new source review” or “nsr” is a preconstruction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source the tailoring rule became applicable to power plants in january 2011 and as a result aps will generally be required to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional nsr analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants 

consistent with president obama’s june 2013 climate action plan addressing his plans to reduce ghg emissions in the united states pursuant to its endangerment finding and its authority under section 111b of the clean air act on september 20 2013 epa issued a proposed rule which would establish new source performance standards “nsps” for new fossilfired power plants subsequently on june 2 2014 epa issued two additional proposed rules to regulate ghg emissions from modified and reconstructed electric generating units egus pursuant to section 111b of the clean air act and existing fossil fuelfired power plants pursuant to clean air act section 111d on january 7 2015 epa announced that its carbon pollution standards for new modified and reconstructed and existing power plants would be finalized in summer 2015 

epa’s proposed rule applicable to modified and reconstructed power plants would require fossil fuelfired egus undergoing modification or reconstruction to meet co 2  performance standards based on a 

table of contents 

combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades the rule would also require existing egus that are modified or reconstructed after becoming subject to state or federal standards of performance for existing power plants under section 111d of the clean air act to continue to meet those requirements we cannot currently predict the shape of any final rules or standards for modified and reconstructed fossilfired egus or assess how they might potentially impact the company 

with respect to existing power plants epa’s proposed “clean power plan” rule proposes statespecific goals or targets to achieve reductions in co 2  emissions from existing egus measured from a 2012 baseline epa’s proposed emission rates would not apply directly to specific units but must be met on a statewide basis as proposed each state’s goal is an emissions rate which is a single number for the future carbon intensity of that state the proposed rule provides guidelines to states to help develop their plans for meeting the interim 20202029 and final 2030 and beyond emission rates set forth in the proposal states would be required to submit their plans to epa by summer 2016 although states may be eligible for one or twoyear extensions provided they submit detailed explanations that contain specified information required by epa in advance of the applicable due date epa’s proposal for arizona would result in instate coalfired generation with the exception of coalfired generation located in indian country shifting to natural gas combined cycle and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are developed 

as for sources in indian country which are not subject to state plans on october 28 2014 epa issued a supplemental rule proposing carbon dioxide emission rates for us territories and areas of indian country with existing fossil fuelfired egus as well as guidelines for plans to achieve those rates the supplemental proposal applies to four corners and the navajo plant both of which are located on the navajo nation with respect to these two plants epa applied the four building blocks described in its june 2 2014 clean air act section 111d proposal to establish interim and final goals expressed as co 2  emission rates if finalized as proposed it is unlikely the rule would require additional emission reductions as a result of the plants’ past and future actions to comply with the best available retrofit technology “bart” requirements of epa’s clean air visibility rule see “epa environmental regulation  regional haze rules” discussion below 

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning  current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biogas and biomass and we expect the percentage of renewable energy in our resource portfolio to increase over the coming years 

aps prepares an inventory of ghg emissions from its operations this inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program and is voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

  

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules    in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the bart for certain older major stationary sources 

table of contents 

including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with epa’s final bart determinations and cholla’s obligations to comply with adeq’s and epa’s determinations coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

cholla in 2007 adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq in early 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart adeq reviewed aps’s recommendations and submitted its proposed bart state implementation plan “sip” for cholla and other sources in arizona in early 2011 

on december 5 2012 epa issued a final bart rule applicable to cholla epa approved adeq’s bart emissions limits for sulfur dioxide “so 2 ” and emissions of particulate matter “pm” but added a so 2  removal efficiency requirement of 95 in addition epa disapproved adeq’s bart determinations for oxides of nitrogen “no x ” and promulgated a federal implementation plan fip establishing a new more stringent “bubbled” no x  emission rate applicable to the two barteligible cholla units owned by aps and the other barteligible unit owned by pacificorp in order to comply with this new rate aps will be required to install scr control technology on all three of the barteligible cholla units aps’s total costs for these postcombustion no x  controls would be approximately 200 million this amount is not included in our current estimates for environmental capital expenditures in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital expenditures” in item 7 under the fip aps has five years from december 2012 to complete installation of the equipment and achieve the bart emission limit for no x  

aps believes that epa’s final rule as it applies to cholla is unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s sip and promulgating a fip that is inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program accordingly on february 1 2013 aps filed a petition for review of the final bart rule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit briefing in the case was completed in february 2014 and the court scheduled oral argument for march 9 2015 

in september 2014 aps met with epa to propose a compromise bart strategy wherein pending certain regulatory approvals aps would permanently close cholla unit 2 by april 2016 and cease burning coal at units 1 and 3 by the mid2020s see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset aps made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment to reduce regional haze is unlikely to be required in the future because retiring and converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more costeffective than and will result in increased visibility improvement over the current bart requirements for no x  imposed on the cholla units under epa’s bart fip because aps’s proposal involves state and federal rulemaking processes aps is unable to predict when or whether it may ultimately be approved 

four corners  on august 6 2012 epa issued its final bart determination for four corners which requires aps to install and operate scr control technology on units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 aps retired four corners units 13 on december 30 2013 aps estimates that its 63 share of the cost of these controls for four corners units 4 and 5 would be at least 350 million aps expects to incur certain of these costs during the 2015 through 2017 timeframe which are included in our capital expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital expenditures” in item 7 for such estimates and for a discussion of the capital expenditures related to the 

table of contents 

agreement to purchase el pasos 7 interest in units 4 and 5 for pm emissions epa is requiring units 4 and 5 to meet an emission limit of 0015 lbmmbtu and a 20 percent opacity limit both of which are achievable through operation of four corners existing baghouses although unrelated to bart the final bart rule also imposes a 20 percent opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions from four corners’ coal and material handling operations 

navajo plant  on january 18 2013 epa issued a proposed bart rule for the navajo plant which would require installation of scr technology in order to achieve a new more stringent plantwide no x  emission limit in addition epa proposed a “better than bart” alternative and solicited comment on other options that could set longer time frames for installing pollution controls if the navajo plant can achieve additional emission reductions on july 26 2013 a group of stakeholders including srp the operating agent for the navajo plant submitted to epa two suggested alternatives to bart which would achieve greater no x  emission reductions and result in greater reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal than epa’s proposed bart determination on july 28 2014 epa issued a final navajo plant bart rule approving the alternative stakeholder plan depending on which alternate operating scenario the navajo plant participants ultimately select the required no x  emission reductions could be achieved by either closing one of the three 750 mw units at the plant or curtailing energy production across all three units such that the emission reductions are commensurate with the closure of approximately one of the navajo plant units aps estimates that its share of costs for upgrades at the navajo plant could be up to approximately 200 million these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital expenditures in item 7 since the majority of such costs are expected to be incurred after 2017 in october 2014 a coalition of environmental groups an indian tribe and others filed petitions for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit asking the court to review epa’s final bart rule for the navajo plant we cannot predict the outcome of this petition 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants    on december 16 2011 epa issued the final mercury and air toxics standards “mats” rule which established maximum achievable control technology “mact” standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired power plants generally plants will have three years after the effective date of the rule to achieve compliance in the case of cholla and four corners aps will have until april 16 2016 or a total of four years after the mats rule’s effective date to comply with the new mact standards because the respective permitting authorities granted aps’s requests for oneyear compliance date extensions similarly srp will have until april 16 2016 to comply with mats at the navajo plant as a result of a oneyear extension granted by epa and the navajo nation epa 

the mats rule will require aps to install additional pollution control equipment aps has installed certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards aps estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately 130 million for cholla which would be avoided if epa approves aps’s compromise proposal discussed under “regional haze rules  cholla” above these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital expenditures” in item 7 no additional equipment is needed for four corners units 4 and 5 to comply with these rules srp the operating agent for the navajo plant is still evaluating compliance options under the rules 

coal combustion waste   on december 19 2014 epa issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals “ccr” such as fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions design and operating criteria groundwater monitoring and corrective action closure requirements and post closure care and recordkeeping notification and internet posting requirements the rule generally requires any existing unlined ccr surface 

table of contents 

impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent’s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving ccr and either retrofit or close and further requires the closure of any ccr landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity 

because the subtitle d rule is selfimplementing the ccr standards apply directly to the regulated facility and facilities are directly responsible for ensuring that their operations comply with the rule’s requirements while epa has chosen to regulate the disposal of ccr in landfills and surface impoundments as nonhazardous waste under the final rule the agency makes clear that it will continue to evaluate any risks associated with ccr disposal and leaves open the possibility that it may regulate ccr as a hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c in the future 

aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners aps estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the ccr rule for four corners is approximately 15 million and its share of incremental costs for cholla is approximately 85 million aps expects to incur certain of these costs during the 20152017 timeframe which are included in the capital expenditure estimates in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital expenditures” in item 7 the amount for cholla contemplates the closure of unit 2 in 2016 see “epa environmental regulation  regional haze rules  cholla” discussion above the navajo plant currently disposes of ccr in a dry landfill storage area at this time srp the operating agent for the navajo plant is analyzing the operations that would be covered by the rule and any resulting compliance costs 

effluent limitation guidelines   on april 19 2013 epa proposed revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus epa’s proposal offers numerous options four of which are “preferred alternatives” that target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and nonchemical metal cleaning wastes operations the preferred alternatives differ with respect to the scope of requirements that would be applicable to existing discharges of pollutants found in wastestreams generated at existing power plants all four alternatives would establish a “zero discharge” effluent limit for all pollutants in fly ash transport water however requirements governing bottom ash transport water differ depending on which alternative epa ultimately chooses and could range from effluent limits based on best available technology economically achievable to “zero discharge” effluent limits depending on which alternative epa finalizes four corners may be required to change equipment and operating practices affecting boilers and ash handling systems as well as change its waste disposal techniques we cannot currently predict the shape of epa’s final rule or whether this action will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows epa is currently subject to a consent decree deadline to finalize the revised guidelines by september 30 2015 

ozone national ambient air quality standards on december 17 2014 epa published a proposal to revise the primary groundlevel ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” currently set at a level of 75 parts per billion “ppb” the rule would set a new more stringent primary standard intended to protect human health within the range of 65 to 70 ppb and revise the secondary standard intended to protect human welfare to within the same range in addition epa is soliciting comment on alternative standard levels below 65 ppb and as low as 60 ppb epa is accepting public comment on the proposed new ranges for the standards until march 17 2015 and is under a courtordered deadline of october 1 2015 to finalize the rule as ozone standards become more stringent our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas at this time aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

new source review  on april 6 2009 aps received a request from epa under section 114 of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners this request is part of a national enforcement initiative that epa has undertaken under the clean air act epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the nsr provisions of the clean air act other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section 114 requests and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits filed by epa aps responded to epa’s request in august 2009 and is currently unable to predict any resulting actions the epa may take including any potential litigation 

clean air act citizen lawsuit    on october 4 2011 earthjustice on behalf of several environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico against aps and the other four corners participants alleging violations of the nsr provisions of the clean air act subsequent to filing its original complaint on january 6 2012 earthjustice filed a first amended complaint adding claims for violations of the clean air act’s nsps program among other things the environmental plaintiffs seek to have the court enjoin operations at four corners until aps applies for and obtains any required nsr permits and complies with the nsps the plaintiffs further request the court to order the payment of civil penalties including a beneficial mitigation project on april 2 2012 aps and the other four corners participants filed motions to dismiss the case is being held in abeyance while the parties seek to negotiate a settlement on march 30 2013 upon joint motion of the parties the court issued an order deeming the motions to dismiss withdrawn without prejudice during pendency of the stay at such time as the stay is lifted aps and the other four corners participants may reinstate their motions to dismiss we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties “prps” prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 2 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district “rid” filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter however we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant   sites    certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning  generation facilities  coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations 

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four 

table of contents 

corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over aps’s groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

little colorado river adjudication   aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition 

table of contents 

of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities including palo verde as a result of the march 2011 earthquake and tsunamis that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan various industry organizations are working to analyze information from the japan incident and develop action plans for us nuclear power plants additionally the nrc has been performing its own independent review of the events at fukushima daiichi including a review of the agency’s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the nrc’s system of regulation we cannot predict when or if the nrc will complete its formal actions as a result of its review as a result of the fukushima event however the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to implement the first tier recommendations of the nrc’s near term task force in response to these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 40 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next two years in addition to the approximate 80 million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december 31 2014 aps’s share is 291 we cannot predict whether these amounts will increase or whether additional financial andor operational requirements on palo verde and aps may be imposed 

  

in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up  aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body 

table of contents 

aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

  

regional haze   aps has received final rulemakings imposing new requirements on four corners cholla and the navajo plant pursuant to these rules epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes bart to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

coal ash   in december 2014 epa issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of ccr which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the rule regulates ccr as a nonhazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccr in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and in a dry landfill storage area at the navajo plant to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these ccr units or the construction of new ccr units beyond what we currently anticipate aps could incur significant additional costs for ccr disposal 

effluent limitation guidelines   epa is expected to finalize revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired egus in 2015 epa has indicated that it expects the revised standards to target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities and scrubberrelated operations aps currently disposes of fly ash waste and bottom ash in ash ponds at four corners changes required by the rule could significantly increase ash disposal costs at four corners 

  

ozone national ambient air quality standards   in december 2014 epa proposed revisions to the national ambient air quality standards which would set new more stringent standards intended to protect human health and human welfare depending on the stringency of the final standards and the implementation requirements aps may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas    

new source review  epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger nsr requirements under the clean air act the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance repair and replacement and did not result in emissions increases and thus are not subject to nsr in 2009 aps received and responded to a request from epa regarding projects and operations at four corners several environmental nongovernmental organizations filed suit against the four corners participants for alleged violations of the clean air acts nsr and nsps programs if epa seeks to impose nsr requirements at four corners or any other aps plant or if the citizens groups prevail in their clean air act lawsuit capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies epa could also seek civil penalties 

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate effects and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions 

concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co2 which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

financial risks  potential greenhouse gas regulation   in  2014 epa proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants epa expects to finalize the proposal in summer 2015 epa’s proposal for arizona would result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company 

physical and operational risks    weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition one of these options could be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generation — 1 program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation we cannot predict future regulatory or legislative action that might result in increased competition 

  

in 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model the use of such products by customers within our territory results in some level of competition aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors “public service corporations” subject to acc regulation and when and the extent to which additional service providers will enter aps’s service territory increasing the level of competition in the market

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the settlement agreement in aps’s most recent retail rate case the “2012 settlement agreement” includes a mechanism the lfcr to address these matters 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

customer and sales growth  for the three years 2012 through 2014 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 13 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of 2030 for 2015 through 2017 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona for the three years 2012 through 2014 aps experienced annual decreases in retail electricity sales averaging 02 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2015 through 2017 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if it declines or if the arizona economy fails to improve we may be unable to reach our estimated demand level and sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses concerns over physical security of these assets is also increasing which may require us to incur additional capital and operating costs to address damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects 

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain certain regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic questions related to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements such as the ees and the res the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including risks related to financing siting permitting technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants including four corners and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is unable to predict the final outcome of pending and future approvals by applicable governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

table of contents 

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 111 million but not more than 165 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

table of contents 

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

research and development activities are ongoing to develop and commercialize alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions including renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’s existing generating facilities less economical in addition advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

aps has and continues to pursue and implement smart grid technologies including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies as well as digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as established or mature as aps’s existing technologies and equipment widespread installation and acceptance of these technologies could enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s business 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is maturing with approximately 37 of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2017 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are subject to information security risks   and risks of unauthorized access to our systems 

  

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including confidential customer employee financial or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access our generation transmission and distribution facilities information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security customer and business information one of these agencies nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of our operating systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply the increasing promulgation of nerc rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards 

table of contents 

  

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and attempted intrusions none of them to date has been material to the company the implementation of additional security measures could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect pinnacle west’s and aps’s reputation with customers and the public 

  

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons including new rules and regulations periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and the cost of maintaining these sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy financial regulation or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 

additionally an increase in our leverage whether as a result of these factors or otherwise could adversely affect us by 

• causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

• increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

   

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities 

table of contents 

depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and recent healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also result in similar impacts the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise the patient protection and affordable care act is expected to result in additional healthcare cost increases costs and other effects of the legislation which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees cannot be determined with certainty at this time 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly owned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

table of contents 

  

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

 

table of contents 

   

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2014 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

see “business of arizona public service company” in item 1 for a map detailing the location of aps’s major power plants and principal transmission lines 

  

transmission and distribution facilities 

  

current facilities    aps’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 5909 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5686 miles of which are located in arizona aps’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11071 miles of overhead lines and approximately 17908 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps distribution facilities reflect an actual net gain of 167 miles in 2014 aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2014 

  

  

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2015 plan aps projects it will develop 275 miles of new lines over the next ten years one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the project consists of four phases the first phase morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv is currently inservice the second and third phases delaney to palo verde 500kv and delaney to sun valley 500kv are 

table of contents 

under construction the fourth phase morgan to sun valley 500kv has been permitted and is in final design and development in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed with the capability to string a 230kv line as a second circuit 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’s 2015 transmission plan are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california the north gila to hassayampa line is under construction and expected to be in service before the summer of 2015 

physical security standards on march 7 2014 ferc issued an order requiring nerc to act within 90 days to develop standards that will require utilities to take steps or to demonstrate that they have taken steps to address physical security risks and vulnerabilities related to the reliable operation of the bulkpower system on may 23 2014 nerc filed a petition with ferc for approval of the proposed physical security reliability standard cip0141 on november 20 2014 ferc approved the physical security reliability standard cip0141 and on january 21 2015 ferc issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration the physical security reliability standard requires transmission owners and operators to protect those critical transmission stations and substations and their associated primary control centers that if rendered inoperable or damaged as a result of a physical attack could result in widespread instability uncontrolled separation or cascading within an interconnection as required by the physical security reliability standard aps will determine whether it has any critical transmission stations and substations and associated primary control centers that will be required to comply with the standard until aps has made such determination we cannot predict the extent of any financial or operational impacts on aps 

  

plant and transmission line leases and rightsofway on indian lands 

  

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under rightsofway from the federal government the rightofway and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the rightofway and lease for four corners expire in 2016 on march 7 2011 the navajo nation council signed a resolution approving a 25year extension to the existing four corners lease term and providing navajo nation consent to renewal of the related rightsofway aps is filing applications for renewal of these rightsofway with the doi before it may approve the four corners lease extension and issue the renewed rightsofway the united states must complete an analysis under the federal national environmental policy act the esa and related statutes 

  

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes or federal agencies other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe or federal agencies will be required at that time in recent negotiations certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway the ultimate cost of renewal of certain of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is therefore uncertain

of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

overview 

  

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

  

areas of business focus 

  

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

  

nuclear   aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde the march 2011 earthquake and tsunamis in japan and the resulting accident at japan’s fukushima daiichi nuclear power station had a significant impact on nuclear power operators worldwide in the aftermath of the accident the nrc conducted an independent assessment to consider actions to address lessons learned from the fukushima events the independent assessment named the near term task force recommended a number of proposed enhancements to us commercial nuclear power plant equipment and emergency plans the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to begin implementing some of the near term task force’s recommendations to implement these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 40 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next two years in addition to the approximate 80 million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december 31 2014 aps’s share is 291 

  

coal and related environmental matters and transactions   aps is a joint owner of three coalfired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning ghg emissions on june 2 2014 epa proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants epa expects to finalize the proposal in summer 2015 epa’s proposal for arizona would result in a shift in instate generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation such a substantial change in aps’s generation portfolio could require additional capital investments and increased operating costs and thus have a significant financial impact on the company aps continually analyzes its longrange capital management plans to assess the potential effects of these changes understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to continue participation in such plants 

cholla 

on september 11 2014 aps announced that it will close its 260 mw unit 2 at cholla by april 2016 and cease burning coal at the other apsowned units units 1 and 3 at the plant by the mid2020s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and 

table of contents 

rules aps will also ask the acc to approve the plan contemplated by the proposal see note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and note 10 for details of the proposal aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the long term than the benefits that would have resulted from adding the emissions control equipment 

four corners 

asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters   on december 30 2013 aps purchased sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million subject to certain minor postclosing adjustments in connection with aps’s most recent retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 23 2014 the acc approved rate adjustments related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of 571 million on an annual basis 

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed the 2016 coal supply agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 when the current coal supply agreement expires through 2031 el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation on february 17 2015 aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el paso’s 7 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the cash purchase price which will be subject to certain adjustments at closing is immaterial in amount and the purchaser will assume el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7 interest completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july 2016 

when aps or an affiliate of aps ultimately acquires el pasos interest in four corners ntec will have an option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not exercise its option 

  

pollution control investments and shutdown of units 1 2 and 3   epa in its final regional haze rule for four corners required the four corners’ owners to elect one of two emissions alternatives to apply to the plant on december 30 2013 aps on behalf of the coowners notified epa that they chose the alternative bart compliance strategy requiring the permanent closure of units 1 2 and 3 by january 1 2014 and installation and operation of scr controls on units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 on december 30 2013 aps retired units 1 2 and 3 

  

lease extension     aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants are pursuing a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process in march 2014 aps received a draft of the environmental impact statement in connection with the doi review process as a proponent of four corners and the navajo mine energy project aps along with other members of the public submitted comments on the draft impact statement aps cannot predict whether these federal approvals will be granted and if so on a timely basis or whether any conditions that may be attached to them

will be acceptable to the four corners owners on december 19 2014 aps obtained a psd permit from epa allowing aps to install scr control technology at four corners 

  

transmission and delivery   aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that continue to support system reliability access to markets and renewable energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the “liquidity and capital resources” section below includes new aps transmission projects through 2017 along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

  

renewable energy    the acc approved the res in 2006 the renewable energy requirement is 5 of retail electric sales in 2015 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in the 2009 settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to use aps’s best efforts to obtain 1700 gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is currently estimated to be approximately 12 of aps’s estimated retail energy sales by yearend 2015 which is more than double the existing res target of 5 for that year a component of the res targets development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties 

on july 12 2013 aps filed its annual res implementation plan covering the 20142018 timeframe and requesting a 2014 res budget of approximately 143 million in a final order dated january 7 2014 the acc approved the requested budget also in 2013 the acc conducted a hearing to consider aps’s proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits on february 6 2014 the acc established a proceeding to modify the renewable energy rules to establish a process for compliance with the renewable energy requirement that is not based solely on the use of renewable energy credits on september 9 2014 the acc authorized a rulemaking process to modify the res rules the proposed changes would permit the acc to find that utilities have complied with the distributed energy requirement in light of all available information the acc adopted these changes on december 18 2014 the revised rules are expected to become effective in the second quarter of 2015 

in accordance with the acc’s decision on the 2014 res plan on april 15 2014 aps filed an application with the acc requesting permission to build an additional 20  mw of apsowned utility scale solar under the az sun program in a subsequent filing aps also offered an alternative proposal to replace the 20 mw of utility scale solar with 10 mw approximately 1500 customers of apsowned residential solar that will not be under the az sun program on december 19 2014 the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing its residential rooftop solar program the first stage of the residential rooftop solar program is to be 8 mw followed by a 2 mw second stage that will only be deployed if coupled with distributed storage the program will target specific distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as make systems available to limitedincome customers who cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties the acc expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes shall not be made until the project is fully in service and aps requests cost recovery in a future rate case 

table of contents 

on july 1 2014 aps filed its 2015 res implementation plan and proposed a res budget of approximately 154 million on december 31 2014 the acc issued a decision approving the 2015 res implementation plan with minor modifications including reducing the budget to approximately 152 million 

  

demand side management  in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed ees of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this standard became effective on january 1 2011 

on june 1 2012 aps filed its 2013 dsm plan in 2013 the standards required aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to 5 of its 2012 retail energy sales later in 2012 aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for 2013 of 876 million 

on march 11 2014 the acc issued an order approving aps’s 2013 dsm plan the acc approved a budget of 689 million for each of 2013 and 2014 the acc also approved a resource savings initiative that allows aps to count towards compliance with the acc electric energy efficiency standards savings for improvements to aps’s transmission and delivery system generation and facilities that have been approved through a dsm plan consistent with the acc’s march 11 2014 order aps intends to continue its approved dsm programs in 2015 

on june 27 2013 the acc voted to open a new docket investigating whether the electric energy efficiency rules should be modified the acc held a series of three workshops in march and april 2014 to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs cost recovery mechanisms incentives and potential changes to the electric energy efficiency and resource planning rules 

on november 4 2014 the acc staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to arizona’s electric utility energy efficiency standards the draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards the acc accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on december 19 2014 a formal rule making has not been initiated and there has been no additional action on the draft to date 

  

rate matters   aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by ferc on june 1 2011 aps filed a rate case with the acc aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into the 2012 settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case see note 3 for details regarding the 2012 settlement agreement terms and for information on aps’s ferc rates 

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

as part of aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 of four corners aps and sce agreed via a “transmission termination agreement” that upon closing of the acquisition the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement “transmission agreement” between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system the “arizona transmission system” for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps previously submitted a request to ferc related to this 

table of contents 

termination which resulted in a ferc order denying rate recovery of 40 million that aps agreed to pay sce associated with the termination aps and sce negotiated an alternate arrangement under which sce would assign its 1555 mw capacity rights over the arizona transmission system to third parties including 300 mw to aps’s marketing and trading group however this alternative arrangement was not approved by ferc in late march 2014 aps and sce filed requests for rehearing with ferc both requests for rehearing were denied on august 14 2014 although aps and sce continue to evaluate potential paths forward it is possible that the terms of the transmission termination agreement may again control aps believes that the original denial by ferc of rate recovery under the transmission termination agreement constitutes the failure of a condition that relieves aps of its obligations under that agreement if aps and sce were unable to determine a resolution through negotiation the transmission termination agreement requires that disputes be resolved through arbitration aps is unable to predict the outcome of this matter if it proceeds to arbitration if the matter proceeds to arbitration and aps is not successful aps may be required to record a charge to its results of operations 

deregulation   on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a new docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry a series of workshops in this docket were held in 2014 and another is currently scheduled for february 26 2015 

  

net metering   on july 12 2013 aps filed an application with the acc proposing a solution to address the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules on december 3 2013 the acc issued its order on aps’s net metering proposal the acc instituted a charge on customers who install rooftop solar panels after december 31 2013 and directed aps to provide quarterly reports on the pace of rooftop solar adoption to assist the acc in considering further increases the charge of 070 per kilowatt became effective on january 1 2014 and is estimated to collect 490 per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electricity grid 

  

in making its decision the acc determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift causing nonsolar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electrical grid acc staff and the state’s residential utility consumer office among other organizations also agreed that a cost shift exists the fixed charge does not increase aps’s revenue because it is credited to the lfcr but it will modestly reduce the impact of the cost shift on nonsolar customers the acc acknowledged that the new charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift the acc also required aps to file its next rate case in june 2015 the earliest date contemplated in the 2012 settlement agreement 

  

in may 2014 the acc began conducting a series of workshops to among other things evaluate the role and value of the electric grid as it relates to rooftop solar and other issues regarding net metering 

  

on july 22 2014 the acc commissioners voted to reopen the december 2013 net metering decision for the limited purpose of deciding whether to eliminate the requirement that aps file its next rate case in june 2015 the vote included a request that parties comment in the docket about their thoughts on removing the filing date requirement and on the process for the broader discussion regarding rate design on august 12 

table of contents 

2014 the acc commissioners voted to lift the requirement that aps file its next general rate case by june 2015 on september 29 2014 the staff of the acc filed in a new docket a proposal for permitting a utility to request acc approval of its proposed rate design outside of and before a general rate case on october 20 2014 aps and other interested stakeholders filed comments to this proposal no further action has been taken in this docket 

  

financial strength and flexibility   pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  

other subsidiaries 

bright canyon energy on july 31 2014 pinnacle west announced its creation of a wholly owned subsidiary bce bce will focus on new growth opportunities that leverage the company’s core expertise in the electric energy industry bce’s first initiative is a 5050 joint venture with midamerican transmission llc the joint venture named transcanyon intends to focus on transmission opportunities within the western electricity coordinating council excluding the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates the joint venture submitted a bid into caisos competitive solicitation process to design build and own a new 500 kv transmission line between arizona and california the delaney to colorado river transmission line the winner of the bidding process is expected to be announced in 2015 this transmission line will connect a planned delaney substation near palo verde in arizona to the existing colorado river substation located just west of blythe california 

el dorado   the operations of el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years 

  

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2012 through 2014 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

customer and sales growth   retail customers in aps’s service territory increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the prioryear for the three years 2012 through 2014 aps’s customer growth averaged 13 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of 2030 for 2015 through 2017 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations were flat for the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the prioryear reflecting the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives partially offset by improving economic conditions and customer growth for the three years 2012 through 2014 aps experienced annual decreases in 

table of contents 

retail electricity sales averaging 02 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average in the range of 0515 during 2015 through 2017 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy could further impact these estimates 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

  

operations and maintenance expenses   operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors in the 2009 settlement agreement aps committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through 2014 on september 30 2014 pinnacle west announced plan design changes to the group life and medical postretirement benefit plan which required an interim remeasurement of the benefit obligation for the plan this remeasurement is expected to reduce net periodic benefit costs on a prospective basis see note 7 in october 2014 the society of actuaries retirement plans experience committee issued its final report on mortality tables rp2014 mortality tables report at december 31 2014 we updated our mortality assumptions using a modification of these tables which better reflects our employees demographics see note 7 for additional details 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities see note 3 regarding deferral of certain costs pursuant to an acc order 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 107 of the assessed value for 2014 105 for 2013 and 96 for 2012 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units transmission and distribution facilities see note 3 for property tax deferrals contained in the 2012 settlement agreement 

  

table of contents 

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s only reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

operating results – 2014 compared with 2013 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2014 was 398 million compared with net income of 406 million for the prior year the results reflect a decrease of approximately 4 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to higher fossil generation costs lower retail sales due to the effects of weather higher property taxes and lower retail transmission revenues these negative factors were partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses related to lower employee benefit costs higher other income and increased revenues for lost fixed cost recovery all other segments income was lower by 4 million primarily related to el dorados investment losses

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2014 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 56 its total shareholder equity was approximately 45 billion and total capitalization was approximately 80 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 32 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2014 the ratio was approximately 46 for pinnacle west and 45 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could “crossdefault” other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

this table excludes 46 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain estimated minimum pension contributions are zero for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively see note 7 

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 1191 million of regulatory assets and 1182 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2014 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2014 is a regulatory asset of 485 million for pension benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm the 

table of contents 

mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2014 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2014 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion on accounting policies and note 13 for fair value measurement disclosures

four corners — four corners is a 5unit coalfired power plant located in the northwestern corner of new mexico aps operates the plant and owns 100 of four corners units 1 2 and 3 and 63 of four corners units 4 and 5 following the acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 described below as of december 30 2013 aps retired units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 970 mw 

  

on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement the “asset purchase agreement” providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners allowing aps to acquire 739 mw from sce on december 30 2013 aps and sce closed this transaction the final purchase price for sce’s interest was approximately 182 million subject to certain minor postclosing adjustments 

  

in connection with aps’s most recent retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 30 2013 aps filed an application with the acc to request rate adjustments prior to its next general rate case related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners if approved these would result in an average bill impact to residential customers of approximately 2 aps cannot predict the outcome of this request 

  

  

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed a longterm agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july 2016 when the current coal supply agreement expires through 2031 the “2016 coal supply agreement” el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation when aps ultimately acquires a right to epe’s interest in four corners by agreement or operation of law ntec will have an option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not exercise its option 

  

the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants are pursuing a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process aps will also require a prevention of significant deterioration “psd” permit from epa to install selective catalytic reduction “scr” control technology at four corners as described below under “environmental matters — epa environmental regulation” aps cannot predict whether these federal approvals will be granted and if so on a timely basis or whether any conditions that may be attached to them will be acceptable to the four corners owners 

  

cholla — cholla is a 4unit coalfired power plant located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 and aps operates that unit for pacificorp aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 647 mw aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 in addition aps has a longterm coal transportation contract 

  

navajo generating station — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in navajo units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2019 with extension rights through 2026 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government the current lease expires in 2019 

  

these coalfueled plants face uncertainties including those related to existing and potential legislation and regulation that could significantly impact their economics and operations see “environmental matters” below and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview and capital expenditures” in item 7 for developments impacting these coalfueled facilities see note 11 for information regarding aps’s coal mine reclamation obligations 

  

  

nuclear 

  

palo verde nuclear generating station — palo verde is a 3unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and approximately 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases approximately 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

  

palo verde leases — in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in accordance with the vie accounting guidance aps consolidates the lessor trust entities for financial reporting purposes and eliminates lease accounting for these transactions the agreements expire at the end of 2015 and contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms aps was required to give notice to the respective lessor trusts between december 31 2010 and december 31 2012 if it wished to retain the leased assets without specifying whether it would purchase the leased assets or extend the leases or return the leased assets to the lessor trusts on december 31 2012 aps gave notice to the respective lessor trusts informing them it will retain the leased assets aps must give notice to the respective lessor trusts by june 30 2014 notifying them which of the purchase or lease renewal options it will exercise we are currently analyzing these options see note 19 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle — the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

  

·   mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

·   conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

·   enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

·   fabrication of fuel assemblies 

·   utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

·   storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2017 90 of its requirements in 2018 and 45 of its requirements in 20192020 the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s conversion services through 2016 95 of its requirements in 20172018 and 45 of its requirements in 20192020 all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2020 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2016 

  

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated 

  

  

by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste the “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 aps is directly and indirectly involved in several legal proceedings related to doe’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste 

  

aps lawsuit for breach of standard contract — in december 2003 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a lawsuit against doe in the us court of federal claims for damages incurred due to doe’s breach of the standard contract the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and the palo verde participants in october 2010 and awarded 302 million in damages to aps and the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe this lawsuit seeks to recover damages incurred due to doe’s failure to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 that lawsuit is presently pending in the court of federal claims 

  

the onemill fee — in 2011 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners and the nuclear energy institute challenged doe’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kwh fee the “onemill fee” paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the standard contract this fee is recovered by aps in its retail rates in june 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” held that doe failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination the dc circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the secretary of the doe “secretary” with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months in february 2013 upon completion of doe’s revised onemill fee adequacy determination the dc circuit reopened the proceedings on november 19 2013 the dc circuit ordered the secretary to notify congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators as he is required to do pursuant to the nwpa and the dc circuit’s order on january 3 2014 the secretary notified congress of his intention to suspend collection of the onemill fee subject to congress’ disapproval 

  

doe’s construction authorization application for yucca mountain — the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 the doe submitted its yucca mountain construction authorization application to the nrc but in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the yucca mountain construction authorization application several interested parties have also intervened in the nrc proceeding additionally a number of interested parties filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application and nrc’s cessation of its review of the yucca mountain construction authorization application the cases have been consolidated into one matter at the dc circuit in august 2013 the dc circuit ordered the nrc to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds 

  

waste confidence — on june 8 2012 the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and 

  

  

permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s 2010 waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with the national environmental policy act “nepa” requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the 2010 waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision the nrc commissioners also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of september 6 2012 in september 2013 the nrc issued its draft environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision in october 2013 the nrc began a series of nationwide public meetings to receive stakeholder input on the draft environmental impact statement the nrc’s meeting schedule was completed in december 2013 the nrc commissioners have instructed the staff to issue the final generic environmental impact statement and rule by no later than september 2014 untimely resolution by the nrc of the remand from the dc circuit could have an adverse impact on certain nrc licensing actions currently palo verde does not have any licensing actions pending with the nrc 

  

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system see note 20 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts 

  

palo verde liability and insurance matters — see “palo verde nuclear generating station — nuclear insurance” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

  

impact of earthquake and tsunami in japan on nuclear energy industry — on march 11 2011 an earthquake measuring 90 on the richter scale occurred off the coast of japan causing a series of seven tsunamis as a result the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station experienced damage 

  

  

following the earthquake and tsunamis the nrc established a task force to conduct a systematic and methodical review of nrc processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system on march 12 2012 the nrc issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the near term task force with respect to palo verde the nrc issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding 1 mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants and 2 enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation 

  

the nrc has issued a series of interim staff guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements due to the developing nature of these requirements we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impacts on palo verde or aps however the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to implement the first tier recommendations of the nrc’s near term task force in response to these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 100 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next several years aps’s share is 291 

  

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

  

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near palo verde ocotillo located in tempe discussed below sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oilonly power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oilonly combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3179 mw gas for these plants is financially hedged up to three years in advance of purchasing and the gas is generally purchased one month prior to delivery aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck 

  

ocotillo is a 330 mw 4unit gas plant in early 2014 aps announced a roughly 600700 million project to modernize the plant which will involve retiring two older 110 mw steam units adding five 102 mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 mw combustion turbines in total this will increase the capacity of the site by 290 mw to 620 mw with completion targeted for summer 2018 

  

solar facilities 

  

to date aps has begun operation of 118 mw of utility scale solar through its az sun program discussed below these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona 

  

additionally aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona additionally aps owns 14 mw of 

  

  

solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the accapproved schools and government program 

  

purchased power contracts 

  

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 17 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability 

  

purchased power capacity — aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts including its renewable energy portfolio is summarized in the table below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted 

  

   

a   the capacity under this agreement varies by month with a maximum capacity of 90 mw in each of 2013 and 2014 

b   up to 60 mw of capacity is available however the amount of electricity available to aps under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually 

c   this is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement under which aps receives electricity during the summer peak season from may 15 to september 15 and aps returns a like amount of electricity during the winter season from october 15 to february 15 

d   the capacity under this agreement may be increased in 5 mw increments in each of 2014 2015 and 2016 and 10 mw increments in years 2017 through 2024 up to a maximum of 50 mw 

e   renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “current and future resources — renewable energy standard — renewable energy portfolio” 

  

  

current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

  

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2013 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 8 2013 at 6927 mw compared to the 2012 peak of 7207 mw recorded on august 8 2012 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2013 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 27 excluding certain contractual rights to call on additional capacity on short notice which aps may use in the event of unusual weather or unplanned outages the 2013 reserve margin was 17 aps anticipates the reserve margin for 2014 will be approximately 34 or 24 excluding contractual rights to call on additional capacity aps expects that our reserve margins will decrease over the next three years and that additional conventional resources will be needed around 2017 

  

future resources and resource plan 

  

under the acc’s resource planning rule aps will file by april 1 of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteenyear period the rule requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal the acc’s acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of electric energy services demand management analysis of supplyside options system reliability and risk management aps will be filing its next resource plan by april 1 2014 

  

renewable energy standard 

  

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 45 of retail electric sales in 2014 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement the “2009 settlement agreement” aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be approximately 12 of retail sales by yearend 2015 which is more than double the res target of 5 for that year a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties such as rooftop solar systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 45 in 2014 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the 2009 settlement agreement and its timing 

  

   

  

renewable energy portfolio to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1175 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 1074 mw are currently in operation and 101 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 137 mw of facilities owned by aps 629 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 308 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps aps is developing owned solar resources through the az sun program under this program to date aps estimates its investment commitment will be approximately 695 million see note 3 for additional details about the az sun program including the related cost recovery 

  

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid 

  

  

   

a   under the az sun program an additional 20 mw has been approved to be contracted but is not included in the table above since it is not yet under contract another 30 mw is possible under az sun but has not yet been approved 

b   includes flagstaff community power project and aps school and government program 

c   distributed generation is produced in dc and is converted to ac for reporting purposes 

  

  

demand side management 

  

in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard “ees” of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from the 2009 settlement agreement 

  

government awards 

  

through the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” and other doe initiatives the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs aps continues its work on a 3 million nonarra award for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff arizona this award will conclude during 2015 and is contingent upon aps meeting certain project milestones including doeestablished budget parameters 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model use of such products by customers within our territory would result in an increasing level of competition aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service territory in 

  

  

1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers in 2000 the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals’ decision 

  

in 2008 the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals’ decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august 12 2010 the report stated that additional analysis discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a new docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry workshops in this docket are expected to be held in 2014 

  

wholesale 

  

ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2013 approximately 54 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

  

  

environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative initiatives there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and it is unclear if and when the 113 th congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed ghg emissions the cost to reduce emissions in the event a capandtrade program is established whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned and if so the cost of those allowances in the marketplace and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available and in the event of a carbon tax the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide “co 2 ” equivalent emitted 

  

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program entities selling electricity into california including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity sales into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

  

we continue to monitor arizona regulatory activities and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants in particular sce a prior participant in four corners indicated that sb 1368 may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant and as a result sce sold its entire 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners to aps on december 30 2013 see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coalfueled generating facilities — four corners” above for details of the sale of sce’s interest in four corners to aps 

  

regulatory initiatives   in 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that ghgs fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result epa has the authority to regulate ghg emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants epa issued a rule under the clean air act known as the “tailoring rule” establishing new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when sources including power plants must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits “new source review” or “nsr” is a preconstruction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source the tailoring rule became applicable to power plants in january 2011 several groups filed lawsuits challenging epa’s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule but the dc circuit upheld these rules petitioners asked 

  

  

the united states supreme court to reverse all or part of the appeals court’s decision upholding epa’s ghg rules on october 15 2013 the supreme court granted these petitions limiting the question it would review to whether epa permissibly determined that its regulation of ghg emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the clean air act for stationary sources that emit such gasses including power plants the court is expected to issue its decision in the case no later than mid2014 

  

aps does not expect that any resulting supreme court decision or the tailoring rule will have a significant impact on its current operations the rule will require aps to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional nsr analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants 

  

on june 25 2013 president obama unveiled his climate action plan addressing his plans to reduce ghg emissions in the united states while the plan identifies a wide range of strategies for cutting ghg emissions most important to aps and the electric utility industry is the implementation of carbon pollution standards for new modified and existing fossilfired electric generating units concurrent with the president’s speech the white house issued a presidential memorandum directing epa to use its existing authorities under the clean air act to develop ghg emission standards for new modified and existing power plants the presidential memorandum directs epa to propose ghg emission standards for modified and existing units by june 1 2014 and to finalize them by june 1 2015 the memorandum further directed epa to reissue proposed standards of performance for new power plants by september 20 2013 and to finalize them in a timely fashion 

  

consistent with president obama’s june 2013 directive pursuant to its authority under the clean air act and its endangerment finding on september 20 2013 epa issued a proposed rule which would establish new source performance standards “nsps” for new fossilfired power plants once finalized aps does not expect that the ghg nsps will have any material impact on its current operations epa indicated in its proposal that the rule will not apply to modified or reconstructed electric generating units which are to be addressed in a subsequent rulemaking we cannot currently predict the shape of any final rules or standards for existing fossilfired power plants or assess how they might potentially impact the company aps will continue to monitor these standards as they are developed 

  

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including solar wind geothermal biogas and biomass and we expect the percentage of renewable energy in our resource portfolio to increase over the coming years 

  

aps prepares an inventory of ghg emissions from its operations this inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program and is voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

  

  

epa environmental regulation 

  

regional haze rules   in 1999 epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the best available retrofit technology “bart” for certain older major stationary sources including fossilfired power plants epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

  

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with epa’s final bart determinations and cholla’s obligations to comply with adeq’s and epa’s determinations coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

cholla in 2007 adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq in early 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart adeq reviewed aps’s recommendations and submitted its proposed bart state implementation plan “sip” for cholla and other sources in arizona in early 2011 

  

on december 2 2011 epa provided notice of a proposed consent decree to address a lawsuit filed by a number of environmental nongovernmental organizations which alleged that epa failed to promulgate federal implementation plans “fips” for states that have not yet submitted all or part of the required regional haze sips in accordance with the consent decree on december 5 2012 epa issued a final bart rule applicable to cholla epa approved adeq’s bart emissions limits for sulfur dioxide “so 2 ” and emissions of particulate matter “pm” but added a so 2 removal efficiency requirement of 95 in addition epa disapproved adeq’s bart determinations for oxides of nitrogen “no x ” and promulgated a fip establishing a new more stringent “bubbled” no x emission rate applicable to the two barteligible cholla units owned by aps and the other barteligible unit owned by pacificorp in order to comply with this new rate aps will be required to install scr control technology on all three of the cholla units aps’s total costs for these postcombustion no x controls would be approximately 200 million this amount is not included in our current estimates for environmental capital expenditures in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 under the fip aps has five years from december 2012 to complete installation of the equipment and achieve the bart emission limit for no x  

  

aps believes that epa’s final rule as it applies to cholla is unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s sip and promulgating a fip that is inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program accordingly on february 1 2013 aps filed a petition for review of the final bart rule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit we expect briefing in the case to be completed in february 2014 

  

four corners  on august 6 2012 epa issued its final bart determination for four corners the rule included two compliance options on december 30 2013 aps notified epa that the four corners participants selected the bart alternative which required aps to retire four corners units 13 by january 1 2014 and install and operate scr control technology on units 4 

  

  

and 5 by july 31 2018 consistent with this alternative aps retired four corners units 13 on december 30 2013 aps’s 63 share of the costs for these controls is estimated to be approximately 350 million approximately half of these costs are included in the capital expenditure estimates in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 because aps expects to incur that portion of the costs during the 2014 through 2016 timeframe for pm emissions epa is requiring units 4 and 5 to meet an emission limit of 0015 lbmmbtu and a 20 opacity limit both of which are achievable through operation of the existing baghouses although unrelated to bart the final bart rule also imposes a 20 opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions from four corners’ coal and material handling operations 

  

on october 22 2012 wildearth guardians filed a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit alleging that epa violated the endangered species act “esa” when it promulgated the final four corners bart fip the court granted aps’s motion for leave to intervene as a defendant in the case a decision is expected before the end of 2014 we cannot currently predict the outcome of this case or whether such outcome will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

navajo plant  on january 18 2013 epa issued a proposed bart rule for the navajo plant which would require installation of scr technology in order to achieve a new more stringent plantwide no x emission limit under the proposal the navajo plant participants would have up to five years after epa issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with the bart requirements aps’s total costs for postcombustion no x controls could be up to approximately 200 million the majority of these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 because aps expects to incur such costs in years following 2016 epa’s proposal also includes an “alternative to bart” which would provide the navajo plant with additional time to install the scr technology under this “better than bart” alternative the navajo plant participants would be required to install scr technology on one unit per year in each of 2021 2022 and 2023 in response to epa’s request for comments on other options that could set longer time frames for installing pollution controls if the navajo plant can achieve additional emission reductions on july 26 2013 a group of stakeholders including srp the operating agent for the navajo plant submitted to epa two suggested alternatives to bart which would achieve greater no x emission reductions than epa’s proposed bart rule if the rule is finalized as proposed depending on which alternate operating scenario the navajo plant participants ultimately select the required no x emission reductions could be achieved by either closing one of the three 750 mw units at the plant or curtailing energy production across all three units such that the emission reductions are commensurate with the closure of approximately one of the navajo plant units on september 25 2013 epa issued a supplemental bart proposal proposing to determine that these alternatives are “better than bart” because no x emissions that would be achieved thereunder would result in greater reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal than epa’s proposed bart determination 

  

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants   on december 16 2011 epa issued the final mercury and air toxics standards “mats” which established maximum achievable control technology “mact” standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired power plants generally plants will have three years after the effective date of the rule to achieve compliance in the case of cholla aps will have a total of four years after the mats’ effective date to comply with the new mact standards because on september 24 2012 the permitting authority granted aps’s request for a oneyear compliance date extension similarly srp 

  

  

will have until april 16 2016 to comply with mats at the navajo plant as a result of a oneyear extension granted by epa and the navajo nation epa on january 27 2014 

  

the mats will require aps to install additional pollution control equipment aps has installed certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards aps estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately 120 million for cholla units 2 and 3 these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 no additional equipment is needed for four corners units 4 and 5 to comply with these rules srp the operating agent for the navajo plant is still evaluating compliance options under the rules 

  

cooling water intake structures   epa issued its proposed cooling water intake structures rule on april 20 2011 which provides national standards applicable to certain cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to section 316b of the clean water act the proposed standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by minimizing impingement mortality the capture of aquatic wildlife on intake structures or against screens and entrainment mortality the capture of fish or shellfish in water flow entering and passing through intake structures to minimize impingement mortality the proposed rule would require facilities such as four corners and the navajo plant to either demonstrate that impingement mortality at their cooling water intakes does not exceed a specified rate or reduce the flow at those structures to less than a specified velocity and to take certain protective measures with respect to impinged fish to minimize entrainment mortality the proposed rule would also require these facilities to conduct a “structured sitespecific analysis” to determine what sitespecific controls if any should be required additional studies and a peer review process will also be required at these facilities 

  

as proposed existing facilities subject to the rule would have to comply with the impingement mortality requirements as soon as possible but in no event later than eight years after the effective date of the rule and would have to comply with the entrainment requirements as soon as possible under a schedule of compliance established by the permitting authority aps is performing analyses to determine the costs of compliance with the proposed rule epa will issue the final standards upon completion of its ongoing esa consultations with the us fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service and is working to finalize the standards by april 2014 

  

coal combustion waste   on june 21 2010 epa released its proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals “ccrs” such as fly ash and bottom ash aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production epa proposes regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous waste under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” or hazardous waste under subtitle c of rcra and requested comments on three different alternatives the hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of ash ponds for disposal of ccrs the other two proposals would regulate ccrs as nonhazardous waste and impose performance standards for ash disposal one of these proposals would require retrofitting or closure of currently unlined ash ponds while the other proposal would not require the installation of liners or pond closures epa has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives 

  

in april 2012 a coalition of environmental groups filed suit to compel epa to finalize its proposed ccr rule soon thereafter coal ash recyclers filed similar lawsuits against epa which were consolidated with the environmental groups’ lawsuits on january 29 2014 the parties in the ccr 

  

  

deadline litigation filed a consent decree with the court obligating epa to make a final decision by december 2014 whether or not to adopt the subtitle d option for ccr the consent decree does not foreclose epa from adopting the subtitle c option we cannot currently predict the timing or content of epa’s final rule or whether this action will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

effluent limitation guidelines   on april 19 2013 epa proposed revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired electric generating units epa’s proposal offers numerous options four of which are “preferred alternatives” that target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities scrubber activities and nonchemical metal cleaning wastes operations the preferred alternatives differ with respect to the scope of requirements that would be applicable to existing discharges of pollutants found in wastestreams generated at existing power plants all four alternatives would establish a “zero discharge” effluent limit for all pollutants in fly ash transport water however requirements governing bottom ash transport water differ depending on which alternative epa ultimately chooses and could range from effluent limits based on best available technology economically achievable to “zero discharge” effluent limits depending on which alternative epa finalizes four corners may be required to change equipment and operating practices affecting boilers and ash handling systems as well as change its waste disposal techniques we cannot currently predict the shape of epa’s final rule or whether this action will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows epa is currently subject to a consent decree deadline to finalize the revised guidelines by may 2014 although it is in negotiations to obtain an extension of time 

  

ozone national ambient air quality standards in march 2008 epa adopted new more stringent eighthour ozone standards known as national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” in january 2010 epa proposed to adopt even more stringent eighthour ozone naaqs however the following year president obama decided to withdraw epa’s revised ozone standards until completion of the next review epa had a march 2013 deadline to complete its review of the 2008 ozone naaqs but failed to meet it although epa has not announced a timeline for its review it may release new proposed standards in the second half of 2014 as ozone standards become more stringent our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds andor to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas at this time aps is unable to predict the timing of the final standards or what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

new source review  on april 6 2009 aps received a request from epa under section 114 of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners this request is part of an enforcement initiative that epa has undertaken under the clean air act epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the nsr provisions of the clean air act other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section 114 requests and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits by epa aps responded to epa’s request in august 2009 and is currently unable to predict any resulting actions the epa may take including any potential litigation 

  

clean air act citizen lawsuit    on october 4 2011 earthjustice on behalf of several environmental nongovernmental organizations filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new 

  

  

mexico against aps and the other four corners participants alleging violations of the nsr provisions of the clean air act subsequent to filing its original complaint on january 6 2012 earthjustice filed an amended complaint adding claims for violations of the clean air act’s nsps program among other things the environmental plaintiffs seek to have the court enjoin operations at four corners until aps applies for and obtains any required nsr permits and complies with the nsps the plaintiffs further request the court to order the payment of civil penalties including a beneficial mitigation project on april 2 2012 aps and the other four corners participants filed motions to dismiss the case is being held in abeyance while the parties seek to negotiate a settlement on march 30 2013 upon joint motion of the parties the court issued an order deeming the motions to dismiss withdrawn without prejudice during pendency of the stay at such time as the stay is lifted aps and the other four corners participants may reinstate their motions to dismiss we are unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring 

  

superfundrelated matters the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties “prps” prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 2 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

on august 6 2013 the roosevelt irrigation district “rid” filed a lawsuit in arizona district court against aps and 24 other defendants alleging that rid’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants the lawsuit also alleges that under superfund laws the defendants are jointly and severally liable to rid the allegations against aps arise out of aps’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around ou3 we are unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring 

  

manufactured gas plant sites   certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

navajo nation environmental issues 

  

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

  

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

  

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  

water supply 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

  

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps’s operations 

  

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require 

  

  

a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss in addition aps is a party to a water contract that allows the company to secure water for four corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to four corners in the event of a water shortage in the san juan river basin 

  

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights several of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over aps’s groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the arizona supreme court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  

little colorado river adjudication   aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

business of other subsidiaries 

  

our other operating subsidiary el dorado is not expected to contribute in any material way to our future financial performance nor will it require any material amounts of capital over the next three years we continue to focus on our core utility business and streamlining the company 

  

  

el dorado 

  

el dorado owns minority interests in several energyrelated investments and arizona communitybased ventures el dorado’s shortterm goal is to prudently realize the value of its existing investments as of december 31 2013 el dorado had total assets of 15 million 

  

suncor 

  

in february 2012 our other firsttier subsidiary suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business on march 25 2013 the bankruptcy plan submitted to the court and agreed to by suncor and its creditors the “joint plan” became effective the joint plan provides for the full release of pinnacle west and its affiliates from any and all claims related to suncor suncor’s subsidiaries and their respective estates suncor and its subsidiaries are in the process of being formally dissolved

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and ferc arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify final orders under certain circumstances the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including ferc nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose safetyrelated securityrelated and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities including palo verde as a result of the march 2011 earthquake and tsunamis that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan various industry organizations are working to analyze information from the japan incident and develop action plans for us nuclear power plants additionally the nrc has been performing its own independent review of the events at fukushima daiichi including a review of the agency’s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the nrc’s system of regulation we cannot predict when or if the nrc will complete its formal actions as a result of its review as a result of the fukushima event however the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to implement the first tier recommendations of the nrc’s near term task force in response to these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately 100 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next several years aps’s share is 291 we cannot predict whether these amounts will increase or whether additional financial andor operational requirements on palo verde and aps may be imposed 

  

in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or civil penalties or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 

  

regional haze   aps has received final rulemakings imposing new requirements on four corners and cholla and is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from epa that could impose new requirements on the navajo plant epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes bart to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants epa issued mats to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired power plants the mats will require aps to install additional pollution control equipment at cholla and possibly the navajo plant the financial impact of installing and operating such equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of cholla 

  

coal ash epa released proposed regulations governing the disposal of ccrs which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash epa proposed regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous or hazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products if epa regulates ccrs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps’s ability to dispose of ccrs through the use of ash ponds aps could incur significant costs for ccr disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 

  

  

effluent limitation guidelines   epa is expected to finalize revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired electric generating units in 2014 epa has indicated that it expects the revised standards to target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities and scrubberrelated operations aps currently disposes of fly ash waste and bottom ash in ash ponds at four corners changes required by the rule could significantly increase ash disposal costs at four corners 

  

new source review epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger new source review requirements under the clean air act the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance repair and replacement and did not result in emissions increases and thus are not subject to new source review in 2009 aps received and responded to a request from epa regarding projects and operations at four corners several environmental nongovernmental organizations filed suit against the four corners participants for alleged violations of new source review and the nsps programs of the clean air act if epa seeks to impose new source review requirements at four corners or any other aps plant or if the citizens groups prevail in their clean air act lawsuit capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies epa could also seek civil penalties 

  

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions 

  

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of ghg in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other ghg emissions 

  

financial risks — potential greenhouse gas regulation  epa is taking action to regulate domestic ghg emissions and is expected to issue proposed regulations in mid2014 any limitations on co 2 and other ghg emissions resulting from this regulatory effort could require substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs and could have a material adverse impact on all fossilfuelfired generation facilities particularly coalfired facilities which constitute approximately 30 of aps’s owned and leased generation capacity 

  

at the state level the california legislature enacted legislation to address ghg emissions and the california air resources board approved regulations that established a capandtrade program for 

  

  

ghgs this legislation regulations and other statespecific initiatives may affect aps’s business including sales into the impacted states 

  

physical and operational risks   weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

  

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition one of these options could be a continuation or expansion of aps’s existing ag alternative generation — 1 program which essentially allows up to 200 mw of cumulative load to be served via a buythrough arrangement with competitive suppliers of generation we cannot predict future regulatory or legislative action that might result in increased competition 

  

in 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model the use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors “public service corporations” subject to acc regulation and when and the extent to which additional service providers will enter aps’s service territory increasing the level of competition in the market 

  

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in 

  

  

arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the settlement agreement in aps’s most recent retail rate case the “2012 settlement agreement” includes a mechanism the lfcr to address these matters 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

customer and sales growth for the three years 2011 through 2013 aps’s retail customer growth averaged 10 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 25 for 2014 through 2016 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona for the three years 2011 through 2013 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average by about 1 during 2014 through 2016 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth and usage patterns and the effects of energy efficiency and distributed energy programs and requirements additionally recovery of a substantial portion of our fixed costs of providing service is based upon the volumetric amount of our sales if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if it declines or if the arizona economy fails to improve we may be unable to reach our estimated demand level and sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses concerns over physical security of these assets is also increasing which may require us to incur additional capital and operating costs to address damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects 

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet reliability requirements new or evolving standards or regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain certain regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio the current abundance of low stably priced natural gas together with environmental and other concerns surrounding coalfired generation resources create strategic questions related to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements such as the ees and the res the development of any generation facility is subject to many risks including risks related to financing siting permitting technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

  

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants including four corners and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is currently unable to predict the final outcome of pending and future approvals by applicable governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 111 million but not more than 164 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchange traded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among 

  

  

other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions including clean coal and coal gasification renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation solar energy storage batteries and efficiency technologies and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’s existing generating facilities less economical in addition advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

aps is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies as well as digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested on a longterm basis and their use on largescale systems is not as advanced and established as aps’s existing technologies and equipment widespread installation and acceptance of these technologies could enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on aps’s business 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is aging with approximately 38 of employees eligible to retire by 2017 although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we face increased competition for talent we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems  

  

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information we are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including 

  

  

confidential customer employee financial or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access our generation transmission and distribution facilities information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the implementation of security measures could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect pinnacle west’s and aps’s reputation with customers and the public we obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems but such insurance may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach 

  

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new financial rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

pinnacle west and aps rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may increase our cost of borrowing generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons including periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

  

·   causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

·   increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

·   requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce funds available to us for operations future business opportunities or other purposes 

  

  

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade would also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and recent healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to oci changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise the patient protection and affordable care act is expected to result in additional healthcare cost increases costs and other 

  

  

effects of the legislation which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees cannot be determined with certainty at this time we will continue to monitor healthcare legislation and its impact on our plans and costs 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

·   variations in our quarterly operating results 

·   operating results that vary from the expectations of management securities analysts and investors 

·   changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

·   developments generally affecting industries in which we operate 

·   announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures or capital commitments 

·   announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us 

·   favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments 

·   our dividend policy 

·   future sales by the company of equity or equitylinked securities and 

·   general domestic and international economic conditions 

  

  

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination” transactions with an “interested shareholder” generally any person who owns 10 or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met 

  

·   antigreenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5 of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied 

  

·   the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of the board of directors and fill vacancies on the board of directors whether resulting from such increase or from death resignation disqualification or otherwise and 

  

·   the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and with respect to preferred stock the other terms including preferences and voting rights of those shares without shareholder approval 

  

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

see “business of arizona public service company” in item 1 for a map detailing the location of aps’s major power plants and principal transmission lines 

  

transmission and distribution facilities 

  

current facilities    aps’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 5908 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5685 miles of which are located in arizona aps’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11399 miles of overhead lines and approximately 17758 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 

  

   

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2014 plan aps projects it will develop 275 miles of new lines over the next ten years one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the project consists of four phases the first phase 

  

  

morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv is currently inservice the second phase delaney to palo verde 500kv is under construction the third and fourth phases delaney to sun valley 500kv and morgan to sun valley 500kv have been permitted and are in various stages of final design and development in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed with the capability to string a 230kv line as a second circuit 

  

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’s 2014 transmission plan are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california 

  

plant and transmission line leases and rightsofway on indian lands 

  

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under rightsofway from the federal government the rightofway and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the rightofway and lease for four corners expire in 2016 on march 7 2011 the navajo nation council signed a resolution approving a 25year extension to the existing four corners lease term and providing navajo nation consent to renewal of the related rightsofway aps is filing applications for renewal of these rightsofway with the doi before it may approve the four corners lease extension and issue the renewed rightsofway the united states must complete an analysis under the federal national environmental policy act the esa and related statutes 

  

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes or federal agencies other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe or federal agencies will be required at that time in recent negotiations certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is therefore uncertain

 item 7 management’s discu ssion and analysis 

of financial condition and results of operations 

  

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

  

areas of business focus 

  

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

  

nuclear   aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde the march 2011 earthquake and tsunamis in japan and the resulting accident at japan’s fukushima daiichi nuclear power station had a significant impact on nuclear power operators worldwide in the aftermath of the accident the nrc conducted an independent assessment to consider actions to ensure that its regulations reflect lessons learned from the fukushima events 

  

although the nrc has repeatedly affirmed its position that continued operation of us commercial nuclear power plants does not impose an immediate risk to public health and safety the nrc has proposed enhancements to us commercial nuclear power plant equipment and emergency plans aps management continues to work closely with the nrc and others in the nuclear industry to ensure that the enhancements are implemented in an organized sequential and structured way consistent with their safety benefit and significance of the issue being addressed 

  

coal and related environmental matters and transactions   aps is a joint owner of three coalfired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning ghg emissions concern over climate change and other emissionrelated issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants aps is closely monitoring its longrange capital management plans understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades 

  

  

four corners 

  

asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters   sce a participant in four corners previously indicated that certain california legislation prohibited it from making emission control expenditures at the plant on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into the asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners on december 30 2013 aps and sce closed this transaction the final purchase price for the interest was approximately 182 million subject to certain minor postclosing adjustments 

  

in connection with aps’s most recent retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december 30 2013 aps filed an application with the acc to request rate adjustments prior to its next general rate case related to aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners if approved these would result in an average bill impact to residential customers of approximately 2 aps cannot predict the outcome of this request 

  

concurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners’ coowners executed the 2016 coal supply agreement el paso a 7 owner in units 4 and 5 of four corners did not sign the 2016 coal supply agreement under the 2016 coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the 7 shortfall obligation when aps ultimately acquires a right to epe’s interest in four corners by agreement or operation of law ntec will have an option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec the 2016 coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7 shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not exercise its option 

  

pollution control investments and shutdown of units 1 2 and 3   epa in its final regional haze rule for four corners required the four corners’ owners to elect one of two emissions alternatives to apply to the plant on december 30 2013 aps on behalf of the coowners notified epa that they chose the alternative bart compliance strategy requiring the permanent closure of units 1 2 and 3 by january 1 2014 and installation and operation of scr controls on units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 on december 30 2013 aps retired units 1 2 and 3 

  

lease extension   aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants are pursuing a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process aps will also require a psd permit from epa to install scr control technology at four corners aps cannot predict whether these federal approvals will be granted and if so on a timely basis or whether any conditions that may be attached to them will be acceptable to the four corners owners 

  

transmission and delivery   aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that continue to support system reliability access to markets and renewable energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the “liquidity and capital resources” section 

  

  

below includes new transmission projects through 2016 along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

  

renewable energy    the acc approved the res in 2006 the renewable energy requirement is 45 of retail electric sales in 2014 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in the 2009 settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to use aps’s best efforts to obtain 1700 gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is currently estimated to be approximately 12 of aps’s estimated retail energy sales by yearend 2015 which is more than double the existing res target of 5 for that year a component of the res targets development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties 

  

on july 12 2013 aps filed its annual res implementation plan covering the 20142018 timeframe and requesting a 2014 res budget of approximately 143 million in a final order dated january 7 2014 the acc approved the requested budget also in 2013 the acc conducted a hearing to consider aps’s proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits on february 6 2014 the acc established a proceeding to modify the renewable energy rules so that utilities can establish compliance without using renewable energy credits 

  

on july 12 2013 aps filed an application with the acc proposing a solution to fix the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules in its application aps requested that the acc cause all new residential customers installing new rooftop solar systems to either i take electric service under aps’s demandbased ect2 rate and remain eligible for net metering or ii take service under the customer’s existing rate as if no distributed energy system was installed and receive a bill credit for 100 of the distributed energy system’s output at a marketbased price aps also proposed that the acc i grandfather current rates and use of net metering for existing and immediately pending distributed energy customers and ii continue using direct cash incentives for new distributed energy installations 

  

on december 3 2013 the acc issued its order on aps’s net metering proposal the acc instituted a charge on future customers who install rooftop solar panels and directed aps to provide quarterly reports on the pace of rooftop solar adoption to assist the acc in considering further increases the charge of 070 per kilowatt became effective on january 1 2014 and is estimated to collect 490 per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electricity grid the new policy will be in effect until the next aps rate case 

  

in making its decision the acc determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift causing nonsolar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electrical grid acc staff and the state’s residential utility consumer office among other organizations also agreed that a cost shift exists the fixed charge does not increase aps’s revenue 

  

  

but instead will modestly reduce the impact of the cost shift on nonsolar customers the acc acknowledged that the new charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift 

  

demand side management in december 2009 arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed ees of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this ambitious standard became effective on january 1 2011 the acc issued an order on april 4 2012 approving recovery of approximately 72 million of aps’s energy efficiency and demand side management program costs this amount was recovered by the thenexisting dsmac over a twelvemonth period beginning march 1 2012 this amount did not include 10 million already being recovered in general retail base rates but did include amortization of 2009 costs approximately 5 million of the 72 million 

  

on june 1 2012 aps filed its 2013 demand side management implementation plan in 2013 the standards require aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to 5 of its 2012 retail energy sales later in 2012 aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for 2013 of 876 million 

  

the acc staff recommendation and proposed order issued on october 30 2013 largely recommended continuing the status quo although at lower funding levels acc staff recommended approval of all existing costeffective energy efficiency and demand response programs and a budget of 689 million going forward aps expects to receive a decision from the acc in early 2014 

  

on june 27 2013 the acc voted to open a new docket investigating whether the electric energy efficiency rules should be modified or abolished this spring the acc will hold a series of three workshops to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs cost recovery mechanisms incentives and potential changes to the electric energy efficiency and resource planning rules 

  

rate matters aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by ferc on june 1 2011 aps filed a rate case with the acc aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into the 2012 settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case see note 3 for details regarding the 2012 settlement agreement terms and for information on aps’s ferc rates 

  

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

  

as part of aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 of four corners aps and sce agreed via a “transmission termination agreement” that upon closing of the acquisition the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement “transmission agreement” between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system the “arizona transmission system” for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps previously submitted a request to ferc related to this termination which resulted in a ferc order denying rate recovery of 40 million that aps agreed to pay sce associated with the termination aps and sce negotiated an 

  

  

alternate arrangement under which sce will assign its 1555 mw capacity rights over the arizona transmission system to thirdparties including 300 mw to aps’s marketing and trading group for transmission of the additional power received from four corners this arrangement becomes effective upon ferc approval and will remain in effect until the net payments received by sce in connection with the assignments reach 40 million at which time the arrangement and the transmission agreement will terminate aps believes that ferc will approve the alternate arrangement as filed but if not approved sce and aps will again be subject to the terms of the transmission termination agreement aps believes that the original denial by ferc of rate recovery under the transmission termination agreement constitutes the failure of a condition that relieves aps of its obligations under that agreement if aps and sce were unable to determine a resolution through negotiation the transmission termination agreement requires that disputes be resolved through arbitration aps is unable to predict the outcome of this matter if it proceeds to arbitration 

  

on may 9 2013 the acc voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in arizona the acc subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state one of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market including setting utility rates on a “market” basis would be consistent with the requirements of the arizona constitution on september 11 2013 after receiving legal advice from the acc staff the acc voted 41 to close the current docket and await full arizona constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter the motion approved by the acc also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing costofservice regulatory model that could include elements of competition the acc opened a new docket on november 4 2013 to explore technological advances and innovative changes within the electric utility industry workshops in this docket are expected to be held in 2014 

  

financial strength and flexibility   pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  

el dorado   the operations of el dorado our only other operating subsidiary are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years 

  

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2011 through 2013 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery 

  

  

mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

customer and sales growth retail customer growth in aps’s service territory in 2013 was 13 compared with the prior year for the three years 2011 through 2013 aps’s customer growth averaged 10 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 25 for 2014 through 2016 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations decreased 05 in 2013 compared with the prior year reflecting the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offset by mildly improving economic conditions and customer growth for the three years 2011 through 2013 aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average about 1 during 2014 through 2016 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a failure of the arizona economy to improve could further impact these estimates 

  

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

  

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors in the 2009 settlement agreement aps committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through 2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases incurred in 2011 and 2012 which totaled 25 million as a regulatory asset until the most recent general retail rate case decision became effective on july 1 2012 in july 2012 we began amortizing the regulatory asset over a 36month period 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and 

  

  

distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities see note 1 regarding deferral of certain costs pursuant to an acc order 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 105 of the assessed value for 2013 96 for 2012 and 90 for 2011 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units transmission and distribution facilities see note 3 for property tax deferrals contained in the 2012 settlement agreement 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

  

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s only reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

operating results – 2013 compared with 2012 

  

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2013 was 406 million compared with net income of 382 million for the prior year the results reflect an increase of approximately 21 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to increases related to the retail regulatory settlement effective july 1 2012 see note 3 higher retail transmission revenues and lower net interest charges due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the currentyear period these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses higher fuel and purchased power costs net of related deferrals lower retail sales as a result of changes in customer usage related to energy efficiency customer conservation and distributed generation partially offset by customer growth and higher depreciation and amortization expenses 

  

  

the following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior year 

  

   

a   includes activities related to suncor 

  

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses  regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 57 million higher for the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the prior year the following table summarizes the major components of this change 

  

  

   

operations and maintenance    operations and maintenance expenses increased 40 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

  

·   an increase of 14 million related to technical analysis consulting advertising and communications costs 

  

·   an increase of 13 million related to costs for demandside management renewable energy and similar regulatory programs which were largely offset in operating revenues 

  

·   an increase of 9 million related to the closure of four corners units 1 2 and 3 deferred for regulatory recovery in depreciation 

  

·   an increase of 6 million in energy delivery and customer service costs 

  

·   an increase of 6 million in information technology costs 

  

·   a decrease of 6 million in generation costs primarily related to lower fossil generation outage costs and lower nuclear generation costs and 

  

·   a decrease of 2 million related to other miscellaneous factors 

  

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization expenses were 12 million higher for the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

  

  

increased plant in service partially offset by the regulatory deferral of operating expenses associated with the closure of four corners units 1 2 and 3 

  

interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction    interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction decreased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the prior year primarily because of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the current year 

  

income taxes   income taxes were 5 million lower for the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the prior year primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in the current period partially offset by the effects of higher pretax income in the current year 

  

operating results – 2012 compared with 2011 

  

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2012 was 382 million compared with net income of 339 million for the prior year the results reflect an increase of approximately 59 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to increases related to the retail regulatory settlement effective july 1 2012 see note 3 higher retail transmission revenues lower depreciation and amortization due to 20year palo verde license extensions received in 2011 and lower net interest charges due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the current year 

  

the 17 million decrease in discontinued operations is primarily related to a contribution pinnacle west made to suncor’s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy see note 1 and absence of the 2011 gain on sale of our investment in apses 

  

the following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior year 

  

  

   

a   includes effects of 2011 settlement of certain transmission rightofway costs which did not affect net income but increased both electric operating revenues and operations and maintenance expenses by 28 million costs related to the settlement were offset by related revenues from sce which leases the related transmission line from aps 

b   includes activities related to apses and suncor 

  

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses   regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 71 million higher for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year the following table summarizes the major components of this change 

  

  

   

operations and maintenance   operations and maintenance expenses decreased 19 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

  

·   a decrease of 28 million related to settlement in 2011 of certain transmission rightofway costs which was offset in operating revenues 

  

·   a decrease of 22 million related to costs for demandside management renewable energy and similar regulatory programs 

  

·   a decrease of 15 million in generation costs primarily related to lower nuclear generation costs 

  

·   an increase of 21 million related to employee benefit costs including approximately 12 million of pension and other postretirement costs 

  

·   an increase of 9 million related to higher stock compensation costs resulting from an improved company stock price and estimated performance results 

  

·   an increase of 7 million in information technology costs primarily related to higher software maintenance and 

  

·   an increase of 9 million due to other miscellaneous factors 

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expenses were 23 million lower for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily due to the impacts of palo verde operating license extensions partially offset by increased plant in service 

  

  

taxes other than income taxes   taxes other than income taxes increased 11 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the current year 

  

other income expenses net   other income expenses net decreased 10 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher investment losses of approximately 2 million and other nonoperating expenses of approximately 8 million in the current year 

  

interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction   interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction decreased 24 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the current year 

  

income taxes   income taxes were 53 million higher for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily due to higher pretax income in the current year and a lower effective tax rate in 2011 

  

discontinued operations 

  

results from discontinued operations decreased 17 million primarily due to a contribution pinnacle west made to suncor’s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy see note 1 and absence of a gain related to the sale of our investment in apses in 2011 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2013 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 58 its total shareholder equity was approximately 43 billion and total capitalization was approximately 75 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 30 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west

operating cash flows 

  

2013 compared with 2012   pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was 1153 million in 2013 compared to 1171 million in 2012 a decrease of 18 million in net cash provided the decrease is primarily related to a 127 million change in cash collateral posted and 76 million of higher pension contributions made in 2013 compared to 2012 approximately 18 million of which is reflected in capital expenditures the decrease is partially offset by approximately 167 million of higher cash inflows primarily due to higher authorized revenue requirements resulting from the retail regulatory settlement effective july 1 2012 and other changes in working capital 

  

2012 compared with 2011   pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was 1171 million in 2012 compared to 1125 million in 2011 an increase of 46 million in net cash provided the increase is primarily related to a 77 million reduction of cash collateral posted and a decrease of 23 million in cash paid for interest in the current year partially offset by a 26 million increase in property tax payments a 65 million pension contribution in 2012 approximately 12 million of which is reflected in capital expenditures and other changes in working capital 

  

other    pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under erisa regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension benefit obligations under erisa the qualified pension plan was 107 funded as of january 1 2013 and is estimated to be approximately 103 funded as of january 1 2014 the assets in the plan are comprised of fixedincome equity real estate and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions we made contributions to our pension plan totaling 141 million in 2013 65 million in 2012 and zero in 2011 the minimum contributions for the pension plan total 141 million for the next three years under the recently enacted moving ahead 

  

  

for progress in the 21 st century act zero in 2014 19 million in 2015 and 122 million in 2016 instead we expect to make voluntary contributions totaling 300 million for the next three years 175 million in 2014 of which 70 million was already contributed in early 2014 up to 100 million in 2015 and up to 25 million in 2016 with regard to contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans we made a contribution of approximately 14 million in 2013 23 million in 2012 and 19 million in 2011 the contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans for 2014 2015 and 2016 are expected to be approximately 10 million each year 

  

the 70 million longterm income tax receivable on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2012 represented the anticipated refund related to an aps tax accounting method change approved by the internal revenue service “irs” in the third quarter of 2009 on july 9 2013 irs guidance was released which provided clarification regarding the timing and amount of this cash receipt as a result of this guidance uncertain tax positions decreased 67 million during the third quarter this decrease in uncertain tax positions resulted in a corresponding increase to the total anticipated refund due from the irs and an offsetting increase in longterm deferred tax liabilities additionally as a result of this irs guidance the resulting 137 million anticipated refund was reclassified to current income tax receivable 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 the irs finalized the examination of tax returns for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2009 and the 137 million anticipated refund was reduced by approximately 4 million to reflect the outcome of this examination on december 17 2013 the joint committee on taxation approved the anticipated refund cash related to this refund was received in the first quarter of 2014 

  

investing cash flows 

  

2013 compared with 2012 pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was 1009 million in 2013 compared to 873 million in 2012 an increase of 136 million in net cash used the increase in net cash used for investing activities is primarily related to aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 of four corners of approximately 209 million partially offset by a decrease of approximately 73 million in other capital expenditures 

  

2012 compared with 2011   pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was 873 million in 2012 compared to 782 million in 2011 an increase of 91 million in net cash used the increase in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to the absence of 55 million in proceeds from the sale of life insurance policies in 2011 and the absence of 45 million in proceeds from the sale of pinnacle west’s investment in apses in 2011

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2013 the ratio was approximately 47 for pinnacle west and 45 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt 

  

  

subject to the covenants and could “crossdefault” other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings 

  

see note 6 for further discussions of liquidity matters 

  

credit ratings 

  

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 14 2014 are shown below we are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of shortterm and longterm capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and longterm debt the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’s securities andor result in an increase in the cost of or limit access to capital such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments insurance policies natural gas transportation fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts at this time we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a downward revision to our credit ratings

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2013 dollars in millions 

  

   

a   the longterm debt matures at various dates through 2042 and bears interest principally at fixed rates interest on variablerate longterm debt is determined by using average rates at december 31 2013 see note 6 

b   the shortterm debt represents commercial paper borrowings at aps see note 5 

c   our fuel and purchased power commitments include purchases of coal electricity natural gas renewable energy nuclear fuel and natural gas transportation see notes 3 and 11 these amounts include commitments incurred from acquiring sce’s interest in four corners 

d   contracts to purchase renewable energy credits in compliance with the res see note 3 

e   these contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other obligations 

f   payments to the noncontrolling interests relate to the palo verde sale leaseback see note 19 we have committed to retain the assets relating to the noncontrolling interests beyond 2015 either through lease extensions or by purchasing the assets if we elect to purchase the assets the purchase price will be based on the fair value of the assets at the end of 2015 such value is unknown at this time and is subject to an appraisal process 

  

  

  

if we elect to extend the leases we will be required to make annual payments beginning in 2016 of approximately 23 million however the length of the lease extensions is unknown at this time as it must be determined through an appraisal process due to these uncertainties amounts relating to the noncontrolling interests beyond 2015 have not been included in the table above 

  

this table excludes 42 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain this table also excludes approximately zero 19 million and 122 million in estimated minimum pension contributions for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively see note 8 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 809 million of regulatory assets and 901 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2013 is a regulatory asset of 314 million for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds 

  

  

over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2013 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2013 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

  

   

a   each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2013 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2013 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

  

   

  

a   each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point 

b   this assumes a 1 change in the initial and ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 

  

see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for a discussion on accounting policies and note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion 

  

other accounting matters 

  

during 2013 we adopted new accounting guidance relating to balance sheet offsetting disclosures and disclosures of amounts reclassified from accumulated oci during the first quarter of 2014 we are required to adopt new accounting guidance related to balance sheet presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 

  

market and credit risks 

  

market risks 

  

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets 

  

interest rate and equity risk 

  

we have exposure to changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 14 and note 20 and benefit plan assets the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of their equity and other nonfixed income investments nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

commodity price risk 

  

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas our risk management committee consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 

  

  

the following table shows the net pretax changes in marktomarket of our derivative positions in 2013 and 2012 dollars in millions

the table below shows the fair value of maturities of our derivative contracts dollars in millions at december 31 2013 by maturities and by the type of valuation that is performed to calculate the fair values classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement see note 1 “derivative accounting” and “fair value measurements” for more discussion of our valuation methods 

  

   

  

the table below shows the impact that hypothetical price movements of 10 would have on the market value of our risk management assets and liabilities included on pinnacle west’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 and 2012 dollars in millions 

  

   

a   represents the amounts reflected in income after the effect of psa deferrals 

b   these contracts are economic hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity the impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged to the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the psa the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability

energy sources and resource planning 

  

to serve its customers aps obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements resource planning is an important function necessary to meet arizona’s future energy needs aps’s sources of energy by type during 2012 were as follows 

  

  

generation facilities 

  

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2

on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement the “asset purchase agreement” providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners if consummated aps would acquire 739 mw from sce the purchase price is 294 million subject to certain adjustments completion of the purchase by aps is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc the cpuc and the ferc on march 29 2012 the cpuc issued an order approving the sale on april 18 2012 the acc voted to allow aps to move forward with the purchase the asset purchase agreement provides that the purchase price will be reduced by 75 million for each month between october 1 2012 and the closing date the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the transaction for cost recovery purposes in a future proceeding if the purchase closes the acc also authorized an accounting deferral of certain costs associated with the purchase until any such cost recovery proceeding concludes the ferc application seeking authorization for the transaction was approved on november 27 2012 the principal remaining condition to closing is the negotiation and execution of a new coal supply contract for four corners on terms reasonably acceptable to aps 

  

  

on december 19 2012 bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners announced that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navajo nation setting out the key terms under which full ownership of bncc would be sold to the navajo nation bhp billiton would be retained by bncc under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 key terms of the new coal supply contract are being finalized by the navajo nation and aps and the other four corners coowners 

  

as a result of this proposed change in ownership of bncc aps now expects that a new coal supply contract would be executed upon completion of negotiations and following the endorsement of the transfer of ownership of the stock of bncc to a new navajo nation commercial enterprise to be established by the navajo nation tribal council the decision of the tribal council is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2013 

  

pursuant to the asset purchase agreement either aps or sce has a right to terminate the agreement if satisfaction of the closing conditions had not occurred by december 31 2012 unless the party seeking to terminate is then in breach of the agreement 

  

the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants will pursue a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process 

  

aps has announced that if aps’s purchase of sce’s interests in units 4 and 5 at four corners is consummated it will close units 1 2 and 3 at the plant these events would change the plant’s overall generating capacity from 2100 mw to 1540 mw and aps’s entitlement from the plant from 791 mw to 970 mw 

  

aps cannot predict whether the mutual right to terminate in the asset purchase agreement will be exercised by a party to that agreement in the future whether bhp billiton and the navajo nation will consummate the transfer of ownership of bncc or whether the coal supply contract will be finalized and executed such that closing of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners can occur 

  

cholla — cholla is a 4unit coalfired power plant located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 and aps operates that unit for pacificorp aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 647 mw aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal government and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 aps believes that the current fuel contracts ensure the continued operation of cholla for its useful life in addition aps has a longterm coal transportation contract 

  

navajo generating station — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in navajo units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi 

  

  

tribe the navajo plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2019 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 

  

these coalfueled plants face uncertainties including those related to existing and potential legislation and regulation that could significantly impact their economics and operations see “environmental matters” below and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview and capital expenditures” in item 7 for developments impacting these coalfueled facilities see note 11 for information regarding aps’s coal mine reclamation obligations 

  

nuclear 

  

palo verde nuclear generating station — palo verde is a 3unit nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and about 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases about 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

  

palo verde leases — in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back about 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in accordance with the vie accounting guidance aps consolidates the lessor trust entities for financial reporting purposes and eliminates lease accounting for these transactions the agreements have terms of 295 years expiring at the end of 2015 and contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms aps was required to give notice to the respective lessor trusts between december 31 2010 and december 31 2012 if it wished to retain the leased assets without specifying whether it would purchase the leased assets or extend the leases or return the leased assets to the lessor trusts on december 31 2012 aps gave notice to the respective lessor trusts informing them it will retain the leased assets aps must give notice to the respective lessor trusts by june 30 2014 notifying them which of the purchase or lease renewal options it will exercise we are analyzing these options see note 20 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april 2011 which extended the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle — the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

  

·   mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

·   conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

·   enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

·   fabrication of fuel assemblies 

·   utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

·   storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 100 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2016 95 of its requirements in 2017 and 80 of its requirements in 2018 the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s conversion services through 2016 90 of its requirements in 2017 and 95 of its requirements in 2018 all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2020 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2016 

  

in late august 2012 one of palo verde’s suppliers that converts uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride invoked the force majeure provision in its contract when it shut down its conversion plant due to regulatory compliance issues the palo verde participants have sufficient strategic reserves of enriched uranium such that they do not anticipate a short term impact on nuclear fuel supplies as a result of the force majeure declaration the uranium conversion supplier has undertaken the necessary upgrades to its facility to address the regulatory compliance issues and anticipates resuming operations in a time frame that will not result in an adverse impact on palo verde’s ability to secure longterm conversion services however the participants are continuing to evaluate alternate longterm options for securing conversion services 

  

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998 and aps on behalf of itself and the other palo verde participants filed a lawsuit for doe’s breach of the palo verde standard contract in the us court of federal claims the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and in october 2010 awarded 302 million in damages to the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 on december 19 2012 aps acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe this lawsuit seeks to recover aps’s damages incurred due to doe’s failure to accept palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 

  

the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its yucca mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the nrc several interested parties have intervened in the nrc proceeding and the proceeding has not been conclusively decided by the nrc or the courts additionally a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application none of these lawsuits have been conclusively decided by the courts 

  

on june 8 2012 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “dc circuit” issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel the petitioners had challenged the nrc’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule “waste confidence decision” 

  

the dc circuit found that the agency’s 2010 waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action which consistent with the national environmental policy act “nepa” requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the 

  

  

agency’s actions the dc circuit found that the nrc’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient and therefore remanded the 2010 waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 

  

on september 6 2012 the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision the commission also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of september 6 2012 timely resolution of the remand by the court of appeals could have an adverse impact on certain nrc licensing actions 

  

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system see note 22 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning trusts 

  

palo verde liability and insurance matters — see “palo verde nuclear generating station — nuclear insurance” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

  

impact of earthquake and tsunami in japan on nuclear energy industry — on march 11 2011 an earthquake measuring 90 on the richter scale occurred off the coast of japan after the earthquake the first of a series of seven tsunamis arrived at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station as a result the fukushima daiichi station experienced considerable damage 

  

following the earthquake and tsunamis the nrc established a task force the “nearterm task force” to conduct a systematic and methodical review of nrc processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system on march 12 2012 the nrc issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the near term task force with respect to palo verde the nrc issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding 1 mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants and 2 enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation 

  

the nrc has issued a series of interim staff guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements due to the developing nature of these requirements we cannot predict the financial or operational impacts on palo verde or aps however palo verde continues to comply with regulatory requirements and related reporting to the nrc as specified in the march 12 2012 and interim staff guidance documents 

  

  

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

  

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near the palo verde nuclear generating station ocotillo located in tempe sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at saguaro and yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oilonly power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oilonly combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3389 mw gas for these plants is acquired through aps’s hedging program aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck 

  

solar facilities 

  

to date aps has begun operation of 69 mw of utility scale solar through its az sun program discussed below these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona 

  

additionally aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce about 4 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which aps owns operates and receives energy from approximately 15 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona additionally aps owns 7 mw of solar photovoltaic systems installed across arizona through the acc approved schools and government program 

  

purchased power contracts 

  

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 18 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability 

  

purchased power capacity — aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts including its renewable energy portfolio is summarized in the table below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted 

  

  

   

a   the capacity under this agreement varies by month with a maximum capacity of 104 mw in 2012 and 90 mw in each of 2013 and 2014 

b   up to 60 mw of capacity is available however the amount of electricity available to aps under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually 

c   this is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement under which aps receives electricity during the summer peak season from may 15 to september 15 and aps returns a like amount of electricity during the winter season from october 15 to february 15 

d   the capacity under this agreement increases in phases over the first three years to reach the 100 mw level by the summer of 2012 

e   renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “current and future resources — renewable energy standard — renewable energy portfolio” 

  

current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

  

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2012 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on august 8 2012 at 7207 mw compared to the 2011 peak of 7087 mw recorded on august 24 2011 aps’s reserve margin at the time of the 2012 peak demand calculated using system load serving capacity was 22 excluding certain contractual rights to call on additional capacity on short notice which aps may use in the event of unusual weather or unplanned outages the 2012 reserve margin was 12 aps anticipates the reserve margin for 2013 will be approximately 28 or 19 excluding contractual rights to call on additional capacity aps expects that our reserve margins will decrease over the next five years and that additional conventional resources will be needed around 2017 

  

  

future resources and resource plan 

  

under the acc’s resource planning rule aps will file by april 1 of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteenyear period aps filed its first resource plan pursuant to these rules on april 1 2012 the rule requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal the deadline for the acc to acknowledge aps’s resource plan has been extended from february 1 2013 until april 1 2013 the acc’s acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of electric energy services demand management analysis of supplyside options system reliability and risk management 

  

renewable energy standard 

  

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 4 of retail electric sales in 2013 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be approximately 12 of retail sales by yearend 2015 which is more than double the res target of 5 for that year a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties such as rooftop solar systems accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 4 in 2013 the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the settlement agreement discussed above and its timing 

  

   

renewable energy portfolio to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1090 mw including wind geothermal solar biomass and biogas of this portfolio 667 mw are currently in operation and 423 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 81 mw of facilities owned by aps 349 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 237 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps aps is developing owned solar resources through the az sun program under this program to date aps has executed contracts for the development of 118 mw of new solar generation representing an investment commitment of approximately 502 million see note 3 for additional details about the az sun program including the related cost recovery 

  

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid 

  

   

  

a   includes flagstaff community power project and aps schools and government program 

b   represents contracted capacity 

c   details of these agreements have not yet been publicly announced 

d   distributed generation is produced in dc and is converted to ac for reporting purposes 

e   achieved through incentivebased programs includes resources with productionbased incentives that have terms of 1020 years 

  

demand side management 

  

in recent years arizona regulators have placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from the settlement agreement related to aps’s 2008 retail rate case 

  

government awards 

  

through the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” and other doe initiatives the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs 

  

aps has received two awards from the doe the first is a 3 million nonarra award for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff arizona this award will conclude on march 31 2015 and is contingent upon aps meeting certain project milestones including doeestablished budget parameters second aps was a subrecipient under a 34 million arra award received through the state of arizona for the implementation of various distributed energy and energy efficiency programs in arizona this project concluded on april 30 2012 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more 

  

  

popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model use of such products by customers within our territory would result in an increasing level of competition aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers in 2000 the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals’ decision 

  

to date the acc has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals’ decision in 2008 the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals’ decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august 12 2010 the report stated that additional analysis discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 

  

several acc commissioners have publicly expressed interest in reexamining retail electric competition in 2013 aps cannot predict if or when this reexamination might occur 

  

wholesale 

  

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2012 approximately 56 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

  

  

environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative initiatives there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and with its focus on other issues such as economic recovery and job growth it is unclear if and when the 113 th congress will consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance 

  

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address ghg emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a statewide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which applies to among other entities importers of electricity commenced on january 1 2013 under the program importers of electricity including aps must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity imported into california from outside the state aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 

  

we are monitoring arizona regulatory activities and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants in particular sce a participant in four corners has indicated that sb 1368 may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coalfueled generating facilities — four corners” above for details of the pending sale of sce’s interest in four corners to aps 

  

regulatory initiatives   in december 2009 epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that ghgs fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result epa has the authority to regulate ghg emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act as a result of this “endangerment finding” epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources including power plants on june 3 2010 epa issued a rule under the clean air act known as the “tailoring rule” establishing new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when sources including power plants must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits “new source review” or “nsr” is a preconstruction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source the tailoring rule became effective on august 2 2010 and it became applicable to power plants on january 2 2011 several groups filed lawsuits challenging epa’s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule but on june 26 2012 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued its decision upholding the rules 

  

  

aps does not expect the tailoring rule to have a significant impact on its current operations the rule will require aps to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants 

  

on december 30 2010 pursuant to its authority under the clean air act epa finalized a ghg federal implementation plan “fip” for arizona relating to preconstruction permits for construction of new sources or major modifications of existing sources subsequently in march 2011 epa and adeq entered into an agreement under which epa delegated to adeq authority to issue ghg preconstruction permits and to modify existing ghg preconstruction permits the ghg fip will remain in place until such time as epa approves a state implementation plan “sip” that applies preconstruction permit requirements to ghgemitting stationary sources in arizona aps does not expect the ghg fip to have a significant impact on its current operations 

  

pursuant to its authority under the clean air act on march 27 2012 epa proposed new source performance standards “nsps” for ghg emissions from new electric generating units once finalized aps does not expect the ghg nsps for new units to have an impact on its current operations epa has indicated that the rule will not apply to modified reconstructed or existing electric generating units it is unclear when or if epa will propose such standards which could affect four corners cholla and the navajo plant once promulgated 

  

at the present time we cannot predict what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from epa’s endangerment finding and what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps’s operations if any emission reduction legislation or additional regulations are enacted we will assess our compliance alternatives which may include replacement of existing equipment installation of additional pollution control equipment purchase of allowances retirement or suspension of operations at certain coalfired facilities or other actions although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from ghg emission regulations or legislation could be material we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our regulated rates 

  

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar biogas and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources 

  

aps prepares an inventory of ghg emissions from its operations this inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program and is voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west’s annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

  

climate change lawsuit   in february 2008 the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california against nine oil 

  

  

companies fourteen power companies including pinnacle west and a coal company alleging that the defendants’ emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and constitute a public and private nuisance under both federal and state law the plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages in june 2008 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action which were granted the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in november 2009 

  

on september 21 2012 a threejudge panel of the ninth circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the kivalina plaintiffs’ federal common law public nuisance action the court declined to address any other issue raised by the parties including the plaintiffs’ state nuisance law claim on october 4 2012 the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing by the entire ninth circuit but on november 27 2012 the court denied the plaintiffs’ petition aps continues to believe the action in kivalina is without merit and will continue to defend against both the federal and state claims 

  

epa environmental regulation 

  

regional haze rules   over a decade ago epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the “best available retrofit technology” “bart” for certain older major stationary sources epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

  

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with epa’s final bart determinations and cholla’s obligations to comply with adeq’s and epa’s determinations coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

cholla in 2007 adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq on february 4 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart adeq reviewed aps’s recommendations and submitted its proposed bart sip for cholla and other sources within the state on march 2 2011 

  

on december 2 2011 epa provided notice of a proposed consent decree to address a lawsuit filed by a number of environmental organizations which alleged that epa failed to promulgate fips for states that have not yet submitted all or part of the required regional haze sips in accordance with the consent decree on december 5 2012 epa issued a final bart rule applicable to cholla epa approved adeq’s bart emissions limits for sulfur dioxide “so 2 ” and emissions of particulate matter “pm” but added an so 2 removal efficiency requirement of 95 in addition epa 

  

  

disapproved adeq’s bart determinations for oxides of nitrogen “no x ” and promulgated a fip establishing a new more stringent “bubbled” no x emissions rate applicable to the two barteligible cholla units owned by aps and the other barteligible unit owned by pacificorp in order to comply with this new rate aps will be required to install selective catalytic reduction “scr” technology on all three of the cholla units aps’s total costs for these postcombustion no x controls would be approximately 187 million this amount is not included in our current estimates for environmental capital expenditures in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 under the fip aps has five years from december 2012 to complete installation of the equipment and achieve the bart emissions limit for no x  

  

aps believes that epa’s final rule as it applies to cholla is unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona’s sip and promulgating a fip that is inconsistent with the state’s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program accordingly on february 1 2013 aps filed a petition for review of the final bart rule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit the state of arizona and three other utilities also filed similar petitions on february 4 2013 aps filed a petition for reconsideration and stay of the final bart rule with epa 

  

four corners  on august 6 2012 epa issued its final bart determination for four corners the rule includes two compliance alternatives the first emission control alternative finalized by epa would require the installation of postcombustion controls on each of units 15 at four corners to reduce no x emissions current estimates indicate that aps’s share of total costs for four corners for these controls would be approximately 400 million under the second emission control alternative finalized by epa the owners of four corners would have the option to permanently close units 13 by january 1 2014 and install postcombustion no x controls on each of units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 aps’s share of total costs for these controls would be approximately 300 million the majority of these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 since they would be incurred in years following 2015 for pm emissions epa is requiring units 4 and 5 to meet an emission limit of 0015 lbmmbtu and units 15 to meet a 20 opacity limit both of which are achievable through operation of the existing baghouses because the mercury and air toxics standards will force the installation of baghouses on units 13 if aps chooses not to close those units epa determined it is not necessary or appropriate to set new pm limits for units 13 under the final four corners bart rule see “mercury and other hazardous air pollutants” for additional details of these standards although unrelated to bart the final bart rule also imposes a 20 opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions from four corners’ coal and material handling operations the four corners participants have until july 1 2013 to notify epa of which emission control approach four corners will follow 

  

on october 22 2012 wildearth guardians filed a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit alleging that epa violated the endangered species act “esa” when it promulgated the final four corners bart fip on november 21 2012 aps filed a motion for leave to intervene as a defendant and the court granted that motion on december 10 2012 epa and aps have pending motions with the court to dismiss the petition or in the alternative transfer the case to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit the circuit in which we believe the petition should have been filed we cannot currently predict the outcome of this case or whether such outcome will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

navajo plant  on january 18 2013 epa issued a proposed bart rule for the navajo plant which would require installation of scr technology in order to achieve a new more stringent plantwide no x emission limit under the proposal the navajo plant participants would have up to five years after epa issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with the bart requirements aps’s total costs for postcombustion no x controls could be up to approximately 158 million the majority of these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 since they will be incurred in years following 2015 epa’s proposal also includes an “alternative to bart” which would provide the navajo plant with additional time to install the scr technology under this “better than bart” alternative the navajo plant participants would be required to install scr technology on one unit per year in 2021 2022 and 2023 epa is also requesting comments on other options that could set longer time frames for installing pollution controls if the navajo plant can achieve additional emission reductions comments are due to epa by may 6 2013 

  

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants   on december 16 2011 epa issued the final mercury and air toxics standards “mats” which established maximum achievable control technology “mact” standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired power plants generally plants will have three years after the effective date of the rule to achieve compliance in the case of cholla aps will have a total of four years after the mats’ effective date to comply with the new mact standards because on september 24 2012 the permitting authority granted aps’s request for a oneyear compliance date extension 

  

the mats will require aps to install additional pollution control equipment aps has installed certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards aps currently estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately 124 million for cholla units 13 the estimated costs for four corners units 13 are not included in our current environmental expenditure estimates since our estimates assume the consummation of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 and the subsequent shut down of units 13 cholla’s estimated costs for the next three years are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 for details of our capital expenditure estimates srp the operating agent for the navajo plant is still evaluating compliance options under the mats 

  

cooling water intake structures   epa issued its proposed cooling water intake structures rule on april 20 2011 which provides national standards applicable to certain cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to section 316b of the clean water act the proposed standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by minimizing impingement mortality the capture of aquatic wildlife on intake structures or against screens and entrainment mortality the capture of fish or shellfish in water flow entering and passing through intake structures to minimize impingement mortality the proposed rule would require facilities such as four corners and the navajo plant to either demonstrate that impingement mortality at its cooling water intakes does not exceed a specified rate or reduce the flow at those structures to less than a specified velocity and to take certain protective measures with respect to impinged fish to minimize entrainment mortality the proposed rule would also require these facilities to conduct a “structured sitespecific analysis” to determine what sitespecific controls if any should be required additional studies and a peer review process will also be required at these facilities 

  

  

as proposed existing facilities subject to the rule would have to comply with the impingement mortality requirements as soon as possible but in no event later than eight years after the effective date of the rule and would have to comply with the entrainment requirements as soon as possible under a schedule of compliance established by the permitting authority aps is performing analyses to determine the costs of compliance with the proposed rule epa is working to finalize the standards by june 27 2013 

  

coal combustion waste   on june 21 2010 epa released its proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals “ccrs” such as fly ash and bottom ash aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production epa proposes regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous waste or hazardous waste and requested comments on three different alternatives the hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of ash ponds for disposal of ccrs the other two proposals would regulate ccrs as nonhazardous waste and impose performance standards for ash disposal one of these proposals would require retrofitting or closure of currently unlined ash ponds while the other proposal would not require the installation of liners or pond closures epa has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives 

  

on april 5 2012 a coalition of environmental groups filed suit to compel epa to finalize its proposed ccr rule soon thereafter coal ash recyclers filed similar lawsuits against epa although we do not know when epa will issue a final rule or by when compliance will ultimately be required in an october 11 2012 filing with the court epa took the position that it will need at least a year to finalize the rule motions and crossmotions for summary judgment are currently pending before the court we cannot currently predict the outcome of the lawsuit or epa’s actions or whether such actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

effluent limitation guidelines   epa is subject to a consent decree deadline to propose revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired electric generating units by april 19 2013 and to finalize the rule by may 22 2014 epa has indicated that it expects the revised standards to target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities and scrubberrelated operations if epa requires such conversions under the final rule four corners may be required to change equipment and operating practices affecting boilers and ash handling systems as well as change their waste disposal techniques epa may also revise standards for metals and other pollutants for wastewater streams not associated with ash handling we cannot currently predict the shape of epa’s final rule or whether this action will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

ozone national ambient air quality standards in march 2008 epa adopted new more stringent eighthour ozone standards known as national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” in january 2010 epa proposed to adopt even more stringent eighthour ozone naaqs however on september 2 2011 president obama decided to withdraw epa’s revised ozone standards until at least 2013 when epa would be required to review them as part of its fiveyear naaqs review process as ozone standards become more stringent our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds andor to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions at this time aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

new source review  on april 6 2009 aps received a request from epa under section 114 of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners this request is part of an enforcement initiative that epa has undertaken under the clean air act epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the new source review provisions of the clean air act other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section 114 requests and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits by epa aps responded to epa’s request in august 2009 and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of epa’s response if any or any resulting actions 

  

clean air act lawsuit    on october 4 2011 earthjustice on behalf of several environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico against aps and the other four corners participants alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act subsequent to filing its original complaint on january 6 2012 earthjustice filed a first amended complaint adding claims for violations of the clean air act’s nsps program among other things the plaintiffs seek to have the court enjoin operations at four corners until aps applies for and obtains any required nsr permits and complies with the nsps the plaintiffs further request the court to order the payment of civil penalties including a beneficial mitigation project on april 2 2012 aps and the other four corners participants filed motions to dismiss which are pending we are unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring 

  

endangered species act   on january 30 2011 the center for biological diversity diné citizens against ruining our environment and san juan citizens alliance filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of colorado against osm and doi alleging that osm failed to engage in mandatory esa consultation with the fish and wildlife service prior to authorizing the renewal of an operating permit for the mine that serves four corners the lawsuit alleged that activities at the mine including mining and the disposal of coal combustion residuals would adversely affect several endangered species and their critical habitats aps is not a party to the lawsuit but is monitoring it to determine its potential impact on aps’s operations on march 14 2012 the district court entered an order dismissing the plaintiffs’ lawsuit without prejudice on may 14 2012 the plaintiffs appealed the court’s order to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 

  

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties “prps” prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 2 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

  

manufactured gas plant sites   certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

navajo nation environmental issues 

  

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coalfueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

  

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

  

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  

water supply 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

  

  

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps operations 

  

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

  

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  

little colorado river adjudication   aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and the ferc arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify final orders under certain circumstances the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or the ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including the ferc the nrc epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards in addition to penalties aps may be unable to recover certain costs if for example it fails to implement any of its annual accapproved renewable implementation plans aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict 

  

  

the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities including palo verde as a result of the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan various industry organizations are working to analyze information from the japan incident and develop action plans for us nuclear power plants additionally the nrc is performing its own independent review of the events at fukushima daiichi including a review of the agency’s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the nrc’s system of regulation we cannot predict when or if the nrc will take formal action as a result of its review the financial andor operational impacts on palo verde and aps may be significant 

  

in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is or may become subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs 

  

  

there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

  

regional haze   aps has received final rulemaking imposing new requirements on four corners and cholla and is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from epa that could impose new requirements on the navajo plant epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

coal ash epa released proposed regulations governing the disposal of ccrs which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash epa proposed regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous or hazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products if epa regulates ccrs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps’s ability to dispose of ccrs through the use of ash ponds aps could incur significant costs for ccr disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 

  

effluent limitation guidelines   epa is expected to propose revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technologybased wastewater discharge limitations for fossilfired electric generating units by april 19 2013 and to promulgate a final rule by may 22 2014 epa has indicated that it expects the revised standards to target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities and scrubberrelated operations aps currently disposes of fly ash waste and bottom ash in ash ponds at four corners changes required by the rule could significantly increase ash disposal costs at four corners 

  

new source review epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger new source review requirements under the clean air act the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not result in emissions increases and thus are not subject to new source review in 2009 aps received and responded to a request from epa regarding projects and operations of four corners an environmental organization filed suit against the four corners participants for alleged violations of new source review and the nsps programs of the clean air act if epa seeks to impose new source review requirements at four corners or any other aps plant or if the citizens’ group prevails in its lawsuit significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies epa could also seek civil penalties 

  

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to current or potential future regulations or legislation the economics of continuing to own certain resources particularly coal facilities may deteriorate warranting early retirement of those plants which may result in asset impairments aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

  

  

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

  

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions in addition lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases including a lawsuit filed by the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change 

  

financial risks — potential legislation and regulation  it is possible that some form of legislation or epa action to regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions may occur in the future at the federal level if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which aps operates ultimately pass legislation or if epa promulgates additional regulations regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases from existing generation facilities any resulting limitations on co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossilfuelfired generation facilities particularly coalfired facilities which constitute approximately 28 of aps’s generation capacity 

  

at the state level the california legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas emissions and the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a capandtrade program for greenhouse gas this legislation regulation and other statespecific initiatives may affect aps’s business including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants including four corners following 2016 

  

physical and operational risks   weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

  

  

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers as a result aps cannot predict if when and the extent to which additional competitors may reenter aps’s service territory several acc commissioners have publicly expressed interest in reexamining retail electric competition in 2013 aps cannot predict how and when this reexamination might take place 

  

in 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model the use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors “public service corporations” subject to acc regulation and when and the extent to which additional service providers will enter aps’s service territory increasing the level of competition in the market 

  

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the settlement agreement in aps’s recent retail rate case the “settlement agreement” includes a mechanism the lfcr to address these matters the 2009 

  

  

retail rate case settlement agreement also established energy efficiency goals for aps that extended through 2012 subjecting aps to energy efficiency requirements slightly greater for the first two of those years than required under the rules described above 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs 

  

reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally higher than anticipated penetration of distributed energy may also cause portions of aps’s existing resource fleet such as coal to become uneconomic or operationally burdensome 

  

customer and sales growth for the three years 2010 through 2012 aps’s customer growth averaged 07 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 2 for 2013 through 2015 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona for the three years 2010 through 2012 aps experienced annual declines in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will remain about flat on average during 2013 through 2015 excluding the effects of weather variations actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth and usage patterns and the effects of energy efficiency and distributed energy programs and requirements if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected or if it declines or if the arizona economy fails to improve we may be unable to reach our estimated demand level and sales projections which could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet new or evolving standards and regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain certain regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements and the res the development of any renewable generation facilities resulting from the res is subject to many other risks including risks related to financing siting permitting technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources to meet the required standards could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants including four corners and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is currently unable to predict the final outcome of pending and future approvals by applicable governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde constitutes approximately 18 of our owned and leased generation capacity palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could 

  

  

exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 118 million but not more than 18 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” which was signed into law in july 2010 contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption including clean coal and coal gasification renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation solar and efficiency technologies and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’s existing generating facilities less economical in addition advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

  

aps is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies as well as digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested and their use on largescale systems is not as advanced and established as aps’s existing technologies and equipment uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect aps’s business if national standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to perform as expected in addition widespread installation and acceptance of these devices could enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is aging and a number of our employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we may not be successful we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages exposure to these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems  

  

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information we are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including confidential customer employee financial or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access our generation transmission and distribution facilities information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the implementation of security measures and cost of insurance addressing such activities could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect pinnacle west’s and aps’s reputation with customers and the public 

  

  

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new financial rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

we rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may increase our cost of borrowing generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons including periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

  

·   causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

·   increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

·   requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce funds available to us for operations future business opportunities or other purposes 

  

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

  

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and recent healthcare reform legislation any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise the patient protection and affordable care act is expected to result in additional healthcare cost increases costs and other effects of the legislation which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees cannot be determined with certainty at this time we will continue to monitor healthcare legislation and its impact on our plans and costs 

  

our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 

  

currently we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s debt agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

  

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

·   variations in our quarterly operating results 

·   operating results that vary from the expectations of management securities analysts and investors 

·   changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

·   developments generally affecting industries in which we operate particularly the energy distribution and energy generation industries 

·   announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures or capital commitments 

·   announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us 

·   favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments 

·   our dividend policy 

·   future sales by the company of equity or equitylinked securities and 

·   general domestic and international economic conditions 

  

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination” transactions with an “interested shareholder” generally any person who owns 10 or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met 

  

·   antigreenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5 of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied 

  

  

·   the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of the board and fill vacancies on the board whether resulting from such increase or from death resignation disqualification or otherwise and 

  

·   the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and with respect to preferred stock the other terms including preferences and voting rights of those shares without shareholder approval 

  

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

  

suncor’s continuing winddown of its real estate business may give rise to various claims 

  

since 2009 suncor has been engaged in a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt suncor is focusing on concluding an orderly winddown of its business and as of december 31 2012 suncor had no assets this effort includes addressing contingent liabilities such as warranty and construction claims that may be brought by property owners and potential funding obligations to local taxing districts that financed infrastructure at certain of its real estate developments 

  

pinnacle west has not guaranteed any of suncor’s obligations in february 2012 suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business pinnacle west could be exposed to the uncertainties and complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2012 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

transmission and distribution facilities 

  

current facilities  aps’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 5883 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5660 miles of which are located in arizona aps’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11381 miles of overhead lines and approximately 17572 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 

  

   

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2013 plan aps projects it will develop 275 miles of new lines over the next ten years one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the project consists of four phases the first phase 

  

  

morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv is currently inservice the second phase delaney to palo verde 500kv is under construction the third and fourth phases delaney to sun valley 500kv and morgan to sun valley 500kv have been permitted and are in various stages of final design and development in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed as capable of stringing a 230kv line as a second circuit 

  

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’s 2013 transmission plan are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california 

  

plant and transmission line leases and rightsofway on indian lands 

  

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under rightsofway from the federal government the rightofway and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the rightofway and lease for four corners expire in 2016 on march 7 2011 the navajo nation council signed a resolution approving a 25year extension to the existing four corners lease term and providing navajo nation consent to renewal of the related rightsofway aps is filing applications for renewal of these rightsofway with the doi before it may approve the four corners lease extension and issue the renewed rightsofway the united states must complete an analysis under the federal national environmental policy act the esa and related statutes 

  

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes or federal agencies other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe or federal agencies will be required at that time the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation in march 2011 the navajo nation provided its consent to renew the rightsofway for the transmission lines specified in the lease extension however some of our rightsofway are not covered by the leases or are granted by other indian tribes or federal agencies in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rightsofway certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines not addressed in the lease extension is uncertain we are monitoring these rightofway issues and have had extensive discussions with the respective tribes regarding the rightsofway we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

  

areas of business focus 

  

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

  

nuclear   aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde in 2012 palo verde achieved its best generation year ever producing over 31 million megawatthours with an overall station capacity factor of 923 in 2012 palo verde successfully refueled both unit 2 and unit 3 aps management continues to work closely with regulators and others in the nuclear industry to analyze the lessons learned and address any rulemaking or improvements resulting from the march 2011 events impacting the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan 

  

coal and related environmental matters   apsoperated coal plants four corners and cholla achieved net capacity factors for aps of 71 and 75 respectively in 2012 these capacity factors were lower than in prior years primarily due to lower gas prices resulting in higher production from our gas fleet aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning greenhouse gas emissions concern over climate change and other emissionrelated issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants aps is closely monitoring its longrange capital management plans understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades 

  

sce a participant in four corners has indicated that certain california legislation may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into the asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the purchase price is 294 million subject to certain adjustments completion of the purchase by aps is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc the cpuc and the ferc on march 29 2012 the cpuc issued an order approving the sale on april 18 2012 the acc voted to allow aps to move forward with the purchase the asset purchase agreement provides that the purchase price will be reduced by 75 million for each month between october 1 

  

  

2012 and the closing date the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the transaction for cost recovery purposes in a future proceeding if the purchase closes the acc also authorized an accounting deferral of certain costs associated with the purchase until any such cost recovery proceeding concludes the ferc application seeking authorization for the transaction was approved on november 27 2012 the principal remaining condition to closing is the negotiation and execution of a new coal supply contract on terms reasonably acceptable to aps 

  

on december 19 2012 bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners announced that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navajo nation setting out the key terms under which full ownership of bncc would be sold to the navajo nation bhp billiton would be retained by bncc under contract as the mine manager and operator until july 2016 key terms of the new coal supply contract are being finalized by the navajo nation and aps and the other four corners coowners 

  

as a result of this proposed change in ownership of bncc aps now expects that a new coal supply contract would be executed upon completion of negotiations and following the endorsement of the transfer of ownership of the stock of bncc to a new navajo nation commercial enterprise to be established by the navajo nation tribal council the decision of the tribal council is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2013 

  

pursuant to the asset purchase agreement either aps or sce has a right to terminate the agreement if satisfaction of the closing conditions had not occurred by december 31 2012 unless the party seeking to terminate is then in breach of the agreement 

  

aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 the navajo nation approved these amendments in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants will pursue a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process 

  

aps has announced that if aps’s purchase of sce’s interests in units 4 and 5 at four corners is consummated it will close units 1 2 and 3 at the plant aps owns 100 of units 13 these events will change the plant’s overall generating capacity from 2100 mw to 1540 mw and aps’s entitlement from the plant from 791 mw to 970 mw when the acc approved aps moving forward with the purchase of units 4 and 5 it also approved the recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of units 1 2 and 3 the settlement agreement in aps’s most recent retail rate case allows aps to seek a rate adjustment to reflect the four corners transaction should the transaction close see note 3 

  

aps cannot predict whether the mutual right to terminate in the asset purchase agreement will be exercised by a party to that agreement in the future whether bhp billiton and the navajo nation will consummate the transfer of ownership of bncc or whether the coal supply contract will be finalized and executed such that closing of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners can occur 

  

transmission and delivery   aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy the capital expenditures table presented in the “liquidity and capital resources” section below includes the next three years of new 

  

  

transmission projects along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technologies throughout its service territory designed to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is piloting and deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

  

renewable energy    the acc approved the res in 2006 the renewable energy requirement is 4 of retail electric sales in 2013 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in the settlement agreement related to the 2008 retail rate case aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to 1700 gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be approximately 12 of aps’s estimated retail energy sales by yearend 2015 which is more than double the existing res target of 5 for that year a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties 

  

on june 29 2012 aps filed its annual res implementation plan covering the 20132017 timeframe and requesting 2013 res funding of 97 million to 107 million in a final order dated january 31 2013 the acc approved a budget of 103 million for aps’s 2013 res plan that budget includes 4 million for residential distributed energy incentives and 01 million for commercial distributed energy upfront incentives but did not include any funds for commercial distributed energy productionbased incentives the acc further ordered that a hearing take place to consider i aps’s proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits and ii removing retail sales to aps’s largest industrial customers when calculating aps’s compliance with the annual res requirements 

  

aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 1090 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 667 mw are currently in operation and 423 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 81 mw of solar facilities owned by aps 349 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 237 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

to achieve our res requirements as mentioned above to date aps has entered into contracts for 423 mw of renewable resources that are planned in development or under construction aps’s strategy to procure these resources includes new facilities to be owned by aps purchased power contracts for new facilities and ongoing development of distributed energy resources through the az sun program aps has executed contracts for the development of 118 mw of new solar generation representing an investment commitment of approximately 502 million see note 3 for additional details of the az sun program including the related cost recovery aps has also entered into longterm purchased power agreements for 280 mw from solar facilities currently planned in development or under construction and 94 mw from distributed energy resources agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid 

  

  

demand side management in recent years arizona regulators have placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this ambitious standard became effective on january 1 2011 and will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs the acc issued an order on april 4 2012 approving recovery of approximately 72 million of aps’s energy efficiency and demand side management program costs over a twelvemonth period beginning march 1 2012 this amount does not include 10 million already being recovered in general retail base rates 

  

on june 1 2012 aps filed its 2013 demand side management implementation plan in 2013 the standards will require aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to 5 of its 2012 retail energy sales later in 2012 aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for 2013 of 876 million aps expects to receive a decision from the acc in the second quarter of 2013 

  

rate matters   aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc on june 1 2011 aps filed a rate case with the acc aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into a settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case see note 3 for details regarding the settlement agreement terms and for information on aps’s ferc rates 

  

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

  

as part of aps’s proposed acquisition of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 of four corners aps and sce agreed that upon closing of the acquisition or in 2016 if the closing does not occur the companies will terminate an existing agreement that provides transmission capacity for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps expects to file a request with ferc seeking authorization to cancel the existing agreement and defer a 40 million payment to be made by aps associated with the termination and recover the payment through amortization over a 29year period aps believes the costs associated with the termination of the existing agreement are recoverable but cannot predict whether ferc will approve our request however if the recovery is disallowed by ferc aps would record a charge to its results of operations at the time of the disallowance 

  

financial strength and flexibility pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  

other subsidiaries   the operations of el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets during 2009 our other firsttier subsidiary suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned 

  

  

communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt and as of december 31 2012 suncor had no assets in february 2012 suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business all activities of suncor are now reported as discontinued operations see note 21 suncor’s loss in 2012 is primarily related to a contribution pinnacle west expects to make to suncor’s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy we do not expect suncor’s bankruptcy to have a material impact on pinnacle west’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2010 through 2012 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in operating revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps’s retail customers through the psa these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

customer and sales growth retail customer growth in aps’s service territory in 2012 was 11 compared with the comparable prior year for the three years 2010 through 2012 aps’s customer growth averaged 07 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 2 for 2013 through 2015 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona retail electricity sales in kilowatthours adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased 01 in 2012 compared with the prior year reflecting the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offset by mildly improving economic conditions for the three years 2010 through 2012 aps experienced annual declines in retail electricity sales averaging 01 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will remain about flat on average during 2013 through 2015 including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a failure of the arizona economy to continue to improve could further impact these estimates 

  

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas changes in our generation resource allocation our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

  

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors in the settlement agreement related to the 2008 retail rate case aps committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through 2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases incurred in 2011 and 2012 which totaled 25 million as a regulatory asset until the most recent general retail rate case decision became effective on july 1 2012 in july 2012 we began amortizing the regulatory asset over a 36month period 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities as a result of the twentyyear extensions of the operating licenses for each of the palo verde units granted by the nrc in 2011 we decreased our pretax depreciation expense related to palo verde by approximately 34 million per year starting on january 1 2012 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 96 of the assessed value for 2012 90 for 2011 and 80 for 2010 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units transmission and distribution facilities see note 3 for property tax deferrals contained in the settlement agreement 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates certain deductions and nontaxable items such as afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense 

  

  

while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

  

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electricity service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

apses’s and suncor’s operations have been classified as discontinued operations pinnacle west sold its investment in apses in august 2011 in february 2012 suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business see note 21 

  

operating results — 2012 compared with 2011 

  

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2012 was 382 million compared with net income of 339 million for the prior year the results reflect an increase of approximately 59 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to increases related to the retail regulatory settlement effective july 1 2012 see note 3 higher retail transmission revenues lower depreciation and amortization due to 20year palo verde license extensions received in 2011 and lower net interest charges due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the current year 

  

the 17 million decrease in discontinued operations is primarily related to a contribution pinnacle west expects to make to suncor’s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy see note 21 and absence of the 2011 gain on sale of our investment in apses 

  

the following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior year 

  

  

   

a   includes effects of 2011 settlement of certain transmission rightofway costs which did not affect net income but increased both electric operating revenues and operations and maintenance expenses by 28 million costs related to the settlement were offset by related revenues from sce which leases the related transmission line from aps 

b   includes activities related to apses and suncor 

  

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 71 million higher for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year the following table summarizes the major components of this change 

  

  

   

operations and maintenance   operations and maintenance expenses decreased 19 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

  

·   a decrease of 28 million related to settlement in 2011 of certain transmission rightofway costs which was offset in operating revenues 

  

·   a decrease of 22 million related to costs for demandside management renewable energy and similar regulatory programs 

  

·   a decrease of 15 million in generation costs primarily related to lower nuclear generation costs 

  

·   an increase of 21 million related to employee benefit costs including approximately 12 million of pension and other postretirement costs 

  

·   an increase of 9 million related to higher stock compensation costs resulting from an improved company stock price and estimated performance results 

  

·   an increase of 7 million in information technology costs primarily related to higher software maintenance and 

  

·   an increase of 9 million due to other miscellaneous factors 

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expenses were 23 million lower for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily due to the impacts of palo verde operating license extensions partially offset by increased plant in service 

  

  

taxes other than income taxes   taxes other than income taxes increased 11 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the current year 

  

other income expenses net   other income expenses net decreased 10 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher investment losses of approximately 2 million and other nonoperating expenses of approximately 8 million in the current year 

  

interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction   interest charges net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction decreased 24 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily because of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the current year 

  

income taxes   income taxes were 53 million higher for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior year primarily due to higher pretax income in the current year and a lower effective tax rate in 2011 

  

discontinued operations 

  

results from discontinued operations decreased 17 million primarily due to a contribution pinnacle west expects to make to suncor’s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy see note 21 and absence of a gain related to the sale of our investment in apses in 2011 

  

operating results — 2011 compared with 2010 

  

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2011 was 339 million compared with net income of 350 million for the prior year the 11 million net decrease consisted of a 14 million decrease in income from discontinued operations and a 3 million increase in income from continuing operations primarily related to the regulated electricity segment regulated electricity segment results reflect increased revenues related to weather and higher retail transmission charges and decreased operations and maintenance expenses these positive factors were offset by higher depreciation and amortization due to increased plant in service higher property taxes due to increased property tax rates and higher income taxes including income tax benefits recognized in the prior year 

  

in addition income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2011 included a gain of approximately 10 million after income taxes related to the sale of our investment in apses income from discontinued operations in the prior year was due to a 25 million gain after income taxes related to the sale of apses’s district cooling business see note 21 

  

the following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior year 

  

  

   

a   includes effects of 2011 settlement of certain priorperiod transmission rightsofway related to four corners which did not affect net income but increased both electric operating revenues and operations and maintenance expenses by 28 million costs related to the settlement were offset by related revenues from sce which leases the related transmission line from aps 

b   operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses includes amounts related to demandside management renewable energy and similar regulatory surcharges which were substantially offset in operations and maintenance 

c   includes activities related to apses and suncor 

  

regulated electricity segment 

  

this section includes a discussion of major variances in income and expense amounts for the regulated electricity segment 

  

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses   regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 94 million higher for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year the following table describes the major components of this change 

  

  

   

operations and maintenance   operations and maintenance expenses increased 34 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

  

·   an increase of 28 million related to settlement in 2011 of certain transmission rightsofway costs which was offset in operating revenues 

  

·   an increase of 27 million related to costs for demandside management renewable energy and similar regulatory programs which were offset in operating revenues 

  

·   a decrease of 16 million related to employee benefit costs and 

  

·   a decrease of 5 million due to other miscellaneous factors 

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expenses were 12 million higher for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year primarily because of increased plant in service 

  

taxes other than income taxes   taxes other than income taxes increased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the current period 

  

income taxes   income taxes were 23 million higher for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year this increase was primarily due to the effects of higher pretax income in the current year and income tax benefits recognized in the prior year related to a reduction in the company’s 2010 effective income tax rate 

  

  

discontinued operations 

  

income from discontinued operations for year ended december 31 2011 included a gain of 10 million related to the sale of our investment in apses income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2010 included an after tax gain of 25 million related to the sale of apses’s district cooling business see note 21 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness on december 19 2012 the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0545 per share of common stock payable on march 1 2013 to shareholders of record on february 1 2013 during 2012 pinnacle west increased its indicated annual dividend from 210 per share to 218 per share the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2012 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 57 its total shareholder equity was approximately 41 billion and total capitalization was approximately 72 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 29 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west 

  

many of aps’s current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed into law on january 2 2013 includes provisions extending the eligibility for 50 bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service in 2013 as a result of this provision and the previously enacted bonus depreciation provisions provided for in the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 total cash tax benefits of up to 400500 million are expected to be generated for aps through accelerated depreciation the cash generated is an acceleration of the tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over 20 years it is anticipated that these cash benefits will be fully realized by aps by the end of 2013 with a majority of the benefit realized as of december 31 2012

operating cash flows 

  

2012 compared with 2011 pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was 1171 million in 2012 compared to 1125 million in 2011 an increase of 46 million in net cash provided the increase is primarily related to a 77 million reduction of cash collateral posted and a decrease of 23 million in cash paid for interest in the current year partially offset by a 26 million increase in property tax payments a 65 million pension contribution in 2012 approximately 12 million of which is reflected in capital expenditures and other changes in working capital 

  

2011 compared with 2010 pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was 1125 million in 2011 compared to 750 million in 2010 an increase of 375 million in net cash provided the increase is primarily due to the 161 million change in collateral and margin posted as a result of changes in commodity prices and expiration of prior hedge contracts and a 200 million voluntary pension contribution in 2010 approximately 40 million of which is reflected in capital expenditures in addition aps’s operating cash flows included income tax payments to the parent company of approximately 81 million in 2010 

  

other pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries the requirements of the employee retirement security act of 1974 “erisa” require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under erisa regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension benefit obligations under erisa the qualified pension plan was 105 funded as of january 1 2012 and 101 funded as of january 1 2013 the assets in the plan are comprised of fixedincome equity real estate and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions we made contributions to our pension plan totaling 65 million in 2012 zero in 2011 and 200 million in 2010 the minimum contributions for the pension plan due in 2013 2014 and 2015 under the recently enacted moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 are estimated to be zero 89 million and 112 million respectively we expect to make voluntary contributions totaling 140 million to the pension plan in 2013 and contributions up to approximately 175 million in each of 2014 and 2015 with regard to contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans we made a contribution of approximately 23 million in 2012 19 million in 2011 and 17 

  

  

million in 2010 the contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans for 2013 2014 and 2015 are expected to be approximately 20 million each year 

  

the 70 million longterm income tax receivable on the consolidated balance sheets represents the anticipated refunds related to an aps tax accounting method change approved by the internal revenue service “irs” in the third quarter of 2009 this amount is classified as longterm as there remains uncertainty regarding the timing of this cash receipt further clarification of the timing is expected from the irs within the next twelve months 

  

investing cash flows 

  

2012 compared with 2011 pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was 873 million in 2012 compared to 782 million in 2011 an increase of 91 million in net cash used the increase in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to the absence of 55 million in proceeds from the sale of life insurance policies in 2011 and the absence of 45 million in proceeds from the sale of pinnacle west’s investment in apses in 2011 

  

2011 compared with 2010 pinnacle west’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was 782 million in 2011 compared to 576 million in 2010 an increase of 206 million in net cash used the increase in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to an increase of 131 million in capital expenditures and a decrease of 126 million in net proceeds from the sales of our nonutility businesses see note 21 partially offset by 55 million of proceeds from the sale of life insurance policies in 2011

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2012 the ratio was approximately 46 for pinnacle west and 45 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’s securities andor result in an increase in the cost of or limit access to capital such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments insurance policies natural gas transportation fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts at this time we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a downward revision to our credit ratings

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2012 dollars in millions 

  

  

   

a   the longterm debt matures at various dates through 2042 and bears interest principally at fixed rates interest on variablerate longterm debt is determined by using average rates at december 31 2012 see note 6 

b   our fuel and purchased power commitments include purchases of coal electricity natural gas renewable energy nuclear fuel and natural gas transportation see notes 3 and 11 

c   contracts to purchase renewable energy credits in compliance with the res see note 3 

d   these contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other obligations these amounts do not include the purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 due to additional approvals required see discussion in “overview” 

e   payments to the noncontrolling interests relate to the palo verde sale leaseback see note 20 we have committed to retain the assets relating to the noncontrolling interest beyond 2015 either through lease extensions or by purchasing the assets if we elect to purchase the assets the purchase price will be based on the fair value of the assets at the end of 2015 and such value is unknown at this time if we elect to extend the leases we will be required to make annual payments beginning in 2016 of approximately 23 million however the length of the lease extensions is unknown at this time as it must be determined through an appraisal process due to these uncertainties amounts relating to the noncontrolling interests beyond 2015 have not been included in the table above 

  

this table excludes 135 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain this table also excludes approximately zero 89 million and 112 million in estimated minimum pension contributions for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively see note 8 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 12 billion of regulatory assets and 847 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2012 is a regulatory asset of 780 million for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2012 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2012 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

  

  

   

a   each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2012 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2012 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

  

   

a   each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point 

b   this assumes a 1 change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate 

  

see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

derivative accounting 

  

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we use 

  

  

accrual accounting for derivative instruments designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings unless certain hedge criteria are met effective june 1 2012 aps discontinued cash flow hedging for the significant majority of derivative contracts aps now defers 100 of changes in fair value on these contracts for future rate treatment in accordance with the psa see note 3 

  

see “market risks — commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see “fair value measurements” below for additional information on valuation see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting 

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion 

  

other accounting matters 

  

see note 2 for discussion regarding amended accounting guidance adopted during 2012 relating to fair value measurements and disclosures and the presentation of comprehensive income 

  

market and credit risks 

  

market risks 

  

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets 

  

interest rate and equity risk 

  

we have exposure to changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 14 and note 22 and benefit plan assets the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of its equity and other nonfixed income investments nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

commodity price risk 

  

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas our risk management committee consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 

  

the following table shows the net pretax changes in marktomarket of our derivative positions in 2012 and 2011 dollars in millions

the table below shows the impact that hypothetical price movements of 10 would have on the market value of our risk management assets and liabilities included on pinnacle west’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 and 2011 dollars in millions 

  

  

   

a   represents the amounts reflected in income after the effect of psa deferrals 

b   these contracts are economic hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity the impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged to the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the psa the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability

 item 1 business 

  

pinnacle west 

  

pinnacle west is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 

  

operating revenues in thousands  

  

   

pinnacle west’s other remaining firsttier subsidiaries are suncor and el dorado additional information related to these businesses is provided later in this report 

  

our reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

business of arizona public service company 

  

aps currently provides electric service to approximately 11 million customers we own or lease approximately 6340 mw of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both longterm and shortterm purchased power agreements for additional capacity including a variety of agreements for the purchase of renewable energy during 2011 no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 14 of our electric revenues 

  

  

the following map shows aps’s retail service territory including the locations of its generating facilities and principal transmission lines 

  

  

  

energy sources and resource planning 

  

to serve its customers aps obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements resource planning is an important function necessary to meet arizona’s future energy needs aps’s sources of energy by fuel type during 2011 were as follows 

  

  

generation facilities 

  

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2 

  

coal fueled generating facilities 

  

four corners — four corners is a 5unit coalfired power plant located in the northwestern corner of new mexico aps operates the plant and owns 100 of four corners units 1 2 and 3 and 15 of units 4 and 5 aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 791 mw the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government aps purchases all of four corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a longterm lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation the four corners coal contract runs through 2016 

  

on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners if consummated aps would acquire 739 mw from sce completion of the purchase by aps which is expected to occur in the second half of 2012 is conditioned upon the receipt of regulatory approvals from the acc the california public utilities commission and the ferc the execution of a new coal supply contract expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act and other typical closing conditions 

  

aps on behalf of the four corners participants has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which would extend the term of the four corners leasehold 

  

  

interest from 2016 to 2041 execution by the navajo nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by aps of sce’s interests in four corners the execution of these amendments by the navajo nation requires the approval of the navajo nation council which became effective in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the us department of the interior “doi” as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants will pursue a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process 

  

aps has announced that if aps’s purchase of sce’s interests in units 4 and 5 at four corners is consummated it will close units 1 2 and 3 at the plant these events would change the plant’s overall generating capacity from 2100 mw to 1540 mw and aps’s entitlement from the plant from 791 mw to 970 mw 

  

cholla — cholla is a 4unit coalfired power plant located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 and aps operates that unit for pacificorp aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 647 mw aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal government and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 aps has the ability under the contract to reduce its annual coal commitment and purchase a portion of cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options and to purchase coal required for increased operating capacity aps believes that the current fuel contracts and competitive fuel supply options ensure the continued operation of cholla for its useful life in addition aps has a longterm coal transportation contract 

  

navajo generating station — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in navajo units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2019 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 

  

these coal plants face uncertainties including those related to existing and potential legislation and regulation that could significantly impact their economics and operations see “environmental matters” below and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview and capital expenditures” in item 7 for developments impacting these coal facilities see note 11 for information regarding aps’s coal mine reclamation obligations 

  

nuclear 

  

palo verde nuclear generating station — palo verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and about 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases about 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

  

palo verde leases — in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back about 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in accordance with the vie accounting guidance aps consolidates the lessor trust entities for financial 

  

  

reporting purposes and eliminates lease accounting for these transactions the agreements have terms of 295 years expiring at the end of 2015 and contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms aps must give notice to the respective lessor trusts between december 31 2010 and december 31 2012 if it wishes to exercise or not exercise either of these options we are analyzing these options see note 20 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 the full power operating licenses each valid for a period of 40 years authorize aps as operating agent for palo verde to operate the three palo verde units on december 15 2008 aps applied for renewed operating licenses for the palo verde units for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses on april 21 2011 the nrc approved aps’s application for renewed operating licenses for the palo verde units extending the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively 

  

palo verde fuel cycle — the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

  

·   mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 

·   conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride 

·   enrichment of uranium hexafluoride 

·   fabrication of fuel assemblies 

·   utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and 

·   storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

  

the palo verde participants have contracted for 95 of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2015 90 of its requirements in 2016 — 2017 and 80 of its requirements in 2018 the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s conversion services through 2015 and 95 of its requirements in 2016 — 2018 all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2020 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2016 

  

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel by 1998 and aps on behalf of itself and the other palo verde participants filed a lawsuit for doe’s breach of the palo verde standard contract in the us court of federal claims the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and in october 2010 awarded 302 million in damages to the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006 

  

the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 doe submitted its application to the nrc to authorize construction of the yucca mountain repository in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its yucca mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the nrc several 

  

  

interested parties have intervened in the nrc proceeding and the proceeding has not been conclusively decided by the nrc or the courts additionally a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application none of these lawsuits have been conclusively decided by the courts 

  

on january 26 2012 the blue ribbon commission on america’s nuclear future the “blue ribbon commission” made recommendations on managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle the commission was established in early 2010 at the direction of president obama the president’s directive was based on his assessment that the nation’s approach to managing used nuclear fuel primarily through the repository at yucca mountain has proven to be ineffective 

  

the blue ribbon commission’s report recommended a strategy with several key elements including a new consentbased approach to siting future nuclear waste management facilities a new organization dedicated solely to implementing the waste management program access to the funds nuclear utility ratepayers are providing for the purpose of nuclear waste management prompt efforts to develop geologic disposal facilities consolidated storage facilities and to prepare for the eventual largescale transport of spent nuclear fuel and highlevel waste to consolidated storage and disposal facilities we are monitoring this matter but cannot predict the proposed timing for implementation of the recommended strategy 

  

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in november 2047 if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

  

in addition to the spent fuel stored at palo verde’s onsite isfsi palo verde also generates certain types of low level radioactive waste that are stored onsite currently the class b and class c waste the higher radioactivity of the low level wastes is stored onsite since industry access to a disposal site was eliminated several years ago the nrc is considering regulations that would allow the industry to eliminate much of this waste by blending it with lower level class a waste so that it can be disposed of at a facility such as the one palo verde utilizes in utah 

  

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system see note 23 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning costs 

  

palo verde liability and insurance matters — see “palo verde nuclear generating station — nuclear insurance” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

  

  

impact of earthquake and tsunami in japan on nuclear energy industry — on march 11 2011 a 90 magnitude earthquake occurred off the northeastern coast of japan the earthquake produced a tsunami that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan following these events the nrc commissioners launched a twopronged review of us nuclear power plant safety the nrc supported the establishment of an agency task force to conduct both a near and longterm analysis of the lessons that can be learned from the situation in japan the nearterm task force issued a report on july 12 2011 and on october 3 2011 the nrc staff issued a plan for implementing the nearterm task force’s recommendations 

  

on october 18 2011 the nrc commissioners directed the nrc staff to implement without delay the nearterm task force recommendations subject to certain conditions one such condition is that the agency should strive to complete and implement lessons learned from the earthquake and tsunami in japan within five years a second condition is that the staff should designate the recommendation for a rulemaking to address extended loss of offsite power to be completed within 24 to 30 months 

  

until further action is taken by the nrc as a result of this event we cannot predict any financial or operational impacts on palo verde or aps 

  

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

  

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near the palo verde nuclear generating station ocotillo located in tempe sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at saguaro and yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oil only power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oil only combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3389 mw gas for these plants is acquired through aps’s hedging program aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck 

  

solar facilities 

  

to date aps has begun operation of 50 mw of utility scale solar through its az sun program discussed below these facilities are owned by aps and are located in multiple locations throughout arizona 

  

additionally aps owns and operates more than forty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce about 5 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport a 1 mw facility located at aps’s saguaro power plant and 1 mw of small solar in various locations across arizona aps is in the final stages of developing solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which aps will own operate and receive energy from approximately 15 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona 

  

  

purchased power contracts 

  

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a substantial portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 18 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability 

  

purchased power capacity — aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts including its renewable energy portfolio is summarized in the tables below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted 

  

   

a   the capacity under this agreement varies by month with a maximum capacity of 104 mw 

b   up to 60 mw of capacity is available however the amount of electricity available to aps under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually 

c   this is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement under which aps receives electricity during the summer peak season from may 15 to september 15 and aps returns a like amount of electricity during the winter season from october 15 to february 15 

d   the capacity under this agreement increases in phases over the first three years to reach the 100 mw level by the summer of 2012 

e   renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “current and future resources — renewable energy standard — renewable energy portfolio” 

  

current and future resources 

  

current demand and reserve margin 

  

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2011 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on august 24 2011 at 7087 mw compared to the 2010 peak of 6936 mw recorded on july 15 2010 aps’s operable generating capacity together with purchased power capacity resulted in an actual reserve margin at the time of the 2011 peak demand of 287 the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages 

  

  

future resources and resource plan 

  

under the acc’s resource planning rule aps will file by april 1 st of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteenyear period the first resource plan filing will be due by april 1 2012 the rule requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal the acc’s acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of electric energy services demand management analysis of supplyside options system reliability and risk management 

  

renewable energy standard 

  

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 35 of retail electric sales in 2012 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be 3400 gwh or approximately 10 of retail sales by yearend 2015 which is double the existing res target of 5 for that year a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 30 of the overall res requirement of 35 in 2012 the following table summarizes these requirement standards and their timing 

  

   

renewable energy portfolio to date aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 946 mw including wind geothermal solar biomass and biogas of this portfolio 423 mw are currently in operation and 523 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 55 mw of facilities owned by aps 232 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 136 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps aps continues to develop owned solar resources through the az sun program the az sun program allows aps to own up to 200 mw of solar photovoltaic power plants across arizona by investing up to 975 million through 2015 under this program to date aps has executed contracts for the development of 83 mw of new solar generation representing an investment commitment of approximately 375 million see note 3 for additional details about the az sun program including the related cost recovery 

  

  

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid 

  

   

  

a   subject to approval by the united states department of defense 

b   under the az sun program 117 mw remains to be contracted 

c   represents contracted capacity 

d   details of these agreements have not yet been publicly announced 

e   distributed generation is produced in dc and is converted to ac for reporting purposes 

f   reflects community power project 

g   achieved through incentivebased programs includes resources with productionbased incentives that have terms of 1020 years 

h   agreement ramps up to 40 mw over three years 

  

demand side management 

  

in recent years arizona regulators have placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from the settlement agreement related to aps’s 2008 retail rate case 

  

economic stimulus projects 

  

through the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs by using economic stimulus funding certain programs are also available through the state of arizona 

  

aps has two active awards with the doe the first is a 3 million high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff arizona second aps is a subrecipient under an approximately 4 million arra award received through the state of arizona for the implementation of various distributed energy and energy efficiency programs in arizona doe funding for these awards will continue to be contingent upon aps meeting certain project milestones including doeestablished budget parameters 

  

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

  

retail 

  

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some 

  

  

customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers in 2000 the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision 

  

to date the acc has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision in 2008 the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august 12 2010 the report stated that additional analysis discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 

  

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  

wholesale 

  

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2011 approximately 48 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps hedges both electricity and fuels the majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in aps’s portfolio 

  

  

environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative initiatives in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions there have been no attempts by the 112 th congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions   with congress’s focus on the economy it is unclear when it will again consider a climate change bill in the event climate change legislation is ultimately passed the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until a law is enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance 

  

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating greenhouse gases in arizona the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address greenhouse gas emissions in october 2011 the california air resources board approved final regulations that will establish a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions beginning on january 1 2013 and will establish a greenhouse gas allowance trading program under that cap the first phase of the program which will apply to among other entities electric utilities and importers of electricity is scheduled to commence on january 1 2013 in addition in 2010 the new mexico environmental improvement board enacted a greenhouse gas capandtrade program which was repealed on february 6 2012 and an emissions cap which is scheduled to become effective in 2013 but is undergoing further review 

  

we are monitoring arizona regulatory activities and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants in particular sce a participant in four corners has indicated that sb 1368 may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities — four corners” above for details of the pending sale of sce’s interest in four corners to aps 

  

regulatory initiatives   in december 2009 the epa determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act as a result of this “endangerment finding” the epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources including power plants on june 3 2010 the epa issued a rule under the clean air act known as the “tailoring rule” establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when sources including power plants must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits “new source review” is a preconstruction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source the tailoring rule became effective on august 2 2010 and it became applicable to power plants on january 2 2011 several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the epa’s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule and that litigation 

  

  

continues at the present time we cannot predict whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding or the tailoring rule will be successful 

  

aps does not expect the tailoring rule to have a significant impact on its current operations the rule will require aps to consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions as part of its traditional new source review analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants 

  

on december 30 2010 pursuant to its authority under the clean air act the epa finalized a greenhouse gas federal implementation plan “fip” for arizona relating to preconstruction permits for construction of new sources or major modifications of existing sources as a result of this action effective january 2 2011 the epa assumed responsibility for acting on permit applications for only the greenhouse gas portion of such preconstruction permits state permitting authorities will continue to retain responsibility for the remaining parts of preconstruction permits that are unrelated to emissions of greenhouse gasses to the extent arizona seeks and receives from the epa a delegation of permitting authority for greenhouse gas emissions the state will assume responsibility for issuing both the greenhouse gas and nongreenhouse gas portions of preconstruction permits the greenhouse gas fip will remain in place until such time as the epa approves a state implementation plan “sip” that applies preconstruction permit requirements to greenhouse gasemitting stationary sources in arizona aps does not expect the greenhouse gas fip to have a significant impact on its current operations 

  

pursuant to its authority under the clean air act the epa has also drafted proposed new source performance standards “nsps” for greenhouse gas emissions from certain new and modified electric generating units the proposed standards are currently under review at the white house office of management and budget and a final rule is expected in 2012 in addition it is possible that the epa will propose standards setting federal emission guidelines for existing electric generating facilities in 2012 the nsps for greenhouse gas emissions are expected to apply to four corners cholla and the navajo plant we cannot currently predict the impact of these anticipated rules on aps’s operations 

  

at the present time we cannot predict what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from the epa’s endangerment finding and what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps’s operations if any emission reduction legislation or additional regulations are enacted we will assess our compliance alternatives which may include replacement of existing equipment installation of additional pollution control equipment purchase of allowances retirement or suspension of operations at certain coalfired facilities or other actions although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation could be material we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our rates 

  

company response to climate change initiatives    we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources 

  

  

pinnacle west prepares an annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

  

climate change lawsuit   in february 2008 the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california against nine oil companies fourteen power companies including pinnacle west and a coal company alleging that the defendants’ emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and constitute a public and private nuisance under both federal and state law the plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages in june 2008 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action which were granted the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeals in november 2009 and pinnacle west filed its reply on june 30 2010 on january 24 2011 the defendants filed a motion which was later granted to defer calendaring of oral argument until after the united states supreme court ruled in a similar nuisance lawsuit american electric power co inc v connecticut  

  

on june 20 2011 the supreme court issued its opinion in connecticut holding among other things that the clean air act and the epa actions authorized by the act which are aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions displace any federal common law right to seek abatement of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuelfired power plants however the court left open the issue of whether such claims may be available under state law oral argument in the kivalina case was heard on november 28 2011 the parties await the court’s decision we believe the action in kivalina is without merit and will continue to defend against both the federal and state claims 

  

epa environmental regulation 

  

regional haze rules   over a decade ago the epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land the epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the “best available retrofit technology” “bart” for certain older major stationary sources the epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

  

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with the epa’s final bart determinations and cholla’s obligations to comply with adeq’s determinations coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  

cholla in 2007 adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq on february 4 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart adeq reviewed aps’s recommendations and submitted its proposed bart sip for cholla and other sources within the state on march 2 2011 the epa may accept the proposed sip or reject part or all of it if the epa determines the sip is inadequate if the epa rejects the proposed sip provisions applicable to cholla 

  

  

it could issue a fip for the plant that includes more stringent pollution control technology requirements and emission limits 

  

on december 2 2011 the epa provided notice of a proposed consent decree to address a lawsuit filed by a number of environmental organizations which alleged that the epa failed to promulgate fips for states that have not yet submitted all or part of the required bart sips the proposed consent decree establishes proposed and final promulgation deadlines may 15 2012 and november 15 2012 respectively for the epa to promulgate regional haze fips or approve regional haze sips for 34 states including arizona on january 3 2012 aps submitted comments to the epa regarding the proposed consent decree 

  

once aps receives a final determination as to what constitutes bart for cholla we will have up to five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the bart emission limits however in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities aps is currently implementing portions of its recommended plan for cholla on a voluntary basis costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

  

four corners and the navajo plant   the epa previously requested that aps as the operating agent for four corners and srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant perform a bart analysis for four corners and the navajo plant respectively aps and srp each submitted an analysis to the epa concluding that certain combustion control equipment constitutes bart for these plants based on the analyses and comments received through epa’s rulemaking process the epa will determine what it believes constitutes bart for each plant 

  

on october 6 2010 the epa issued its proposed bart determination for four corners the proposed rule would require the installation of postcombustion controls on each of units 15 at four corners to reduce nitrogen oxides “nox” emissions current estimates indicate that aps’s total costs for these controls could be up to approximately 400 million for four corners if aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 is consummated and units 13 are closed aps’s total costs for these controls would be approximately 300 million see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities — four corners” for details of this proposed transaction the epa also indicated in the proposal that it may require the installation of electrostatic precipitators or baghouses on units 1 2 and 3 to reduce particulate matter emissions aps estimates that its total costs for such particulate removal equipment is approximately 220 million which may also be required under the mercury rules see “environmental matters — mercury and other hazardous air pollutants” below for additional information on these rules the epa proposed a 10 stack opacity limitation for all five units and a 20 opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions although the proposed fugitive dust provision is unrelated to bart 

  

on november 24 2010 aps submitted a letter to the epa proposing an alternative to the epa’s october bart proposal specifically aps proposed to close four corners units 1 2 and 3 by 2014 and to install postcombustion pollution controls for nox on units 4 and 5 by the end of 2018 provided that the epa agrees to a contemporaneous resolution of four corners’ obligations or liability if any under the regional haze and reasonably attributable visibility impairment programs the new source review program and nsps programs of the clean air act 

  

  

on february 10 2011 the epa signed a supplemental notice requesting comment related to the bart rulemaking for four corners in the supplemental notice the epa proposed to find that a different alternative emission control strategy based upon aps’s november 2010 proposal would achieve more progress than the epa’s october 2010 bart proposal the supplemental notice proposes that units 1 2 and 3 would close by 2014 postcombustion pollution controls for nox would be installed on units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 and the nox emission limitation for units 4 and 5 would be 0098 lbsmmbtu rather than the 011 lbsmmbtu proposed by the epa in october 2010 aps provided comments to the epa on both proposals and continues to evaluate them 

  

the epa has not yet issued a proposed rule for the navajo plant srp’s recommended plan for the navajo plant includes the installation of combustion control equipment with an estimated cost to aps of approximately 6 million based on aps’s navajo plant ownership interest if the epa determines that postcombustion controls are required aps’s total costs could be up to approximately 93 million for the navajo plant the four corners and the navajo plant participants will have up to five years after the epa issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with their respective bart requirements 

  

in order to coordinate with each plant’s other scheduled activities the plants are currently implementing portions of their recommended plans described above on a voluntary basis aps’s share of the costs related to the implementation of these portions of the recommended plans are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

  

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants   on december 16 2011 the epa issued the final mercury and air toxics standards “mats” which established maximum achievable control technology “mact” standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossilfired power plants aps will have three potentially four if the permitting authority grants a oneyear extension years after the effective date of the rule to achieve compliance 

  

the mats will require aps to install additional pollution control equipment aps has installed and continues to install certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards aps estimates that the cost for equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately 220 million for four corners units 13 and 89 million for cholla units 13 the estimated costs for four corners units 13 are not included in our current environmental expenditure estimates since our estimates assume the consummation of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 and the subsequent shut down of units 13 cholla’s estimated costs for the next three years are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 for details of our capital expenditure estimates srp the operating agent for the navajo plant is still evaluating compliance options under the mats if it is determined that the installation of polishing baghouses is required aps’s total costs could be up to approximately 92 million for the navajo plant 

  

cooling water intake structures   the epa issued its proposed cooling water intake structures rule on april 20 2011 which provides national standards applicable to certain cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to section 316b of the clean water act the proposed standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by minimizing impingement mortality the capture of aquatic wildlife on intake structures or against screens and entrainment mortality the capture of fish or shellfish in water flow entering and passing through intake structures to minimize impingement mortality the proposed rule would require 

  

  

facilities such as four corners and the navajo plant to either demonstrate that impingement mortality at its cooling water intakes does not exceed a specified rate or reduce the flow at those structures to less than a specified velocity and to take certain protective measures with respect to impinged fish to minimize entrainment mortality the proposed rule would also require these facilities to conduct a “structured sitespecific analysis” to determine what sitespecific controls if any should be required additional studies and a peer review process will also be required at these facilities 

  

as proposed existing facilities subject to the rule would have to comply with the impingement mortality requirements as soon as possible but in no event later than eight years after the effective date of the rule and would have to comply with the entrainment requirements as soon as possible under a schedule of compliance established by the permitting authority aps is performing analyses to determine the costs of compliance with the proposed rule aps filed comments on the proposed rule on july 21 2011 

  

coal combustion waste   on june 21 2010 the epa released its proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals “ccrs” such as fly ash and bottom ash aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production the epa proposes regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous waste or hazardous waste and requested comments on three different alternatives the hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of ash ponds for disposal of ccrs the other two proposals would regulate ccrs as nonhazardous waste and impose performance standards for ash disposal one of these proposals would require retrofitting or closure of currently unlined ash ponds while the other proposal would not require the installation of liners or pond closures the epa has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives 

  

aps filed comments on the proposed rule during the public comment period which ended on november 19 2010 although we do not know when the epa will issue a final rule or by when compliance will ultimately be required it is expected that the agency may take final action on the rule in 2012 we cannot currently predict the outcome of the epa’s actions or whether such actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

ozone national ambient air quality standards in march 2008 the epa adopted new more stringent eighthour ozone standards known as national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” in january 2010 the epa proposed to adopt even more stringent eighthour ozone naaqs however on september 2 2011 president obama decided to withdraw the epa’s revised ozone standards until at least 2013 when the epa would be required to review them as part of its fiveyear naaqs review process as ozone standards become more stringent our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds andor to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions at this time aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

new source review  on april 6 2009 aps received a request from the epa under section 114 of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners this request is part of an enforcement initiative that the epa has undertaken under the clean air act the epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the new source review provisions of the clean air act other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section 114 requests and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and 

  

  

lawsuits by the epa aps responded to the epa’s request in august 2009 and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of the epa’s response if any or any resulting actions 

  

on october 4 2011 earthjustice on behalf of several environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico against aps and the other four corners participants alleging violations of the prevention of significant deterioration “psd” provisions of the clean air act subsequent to filing its original complaint on january 6 2012 earthjustice filed a first amended complaint adding claims for violations of the clean air act’s nsps program among other things the plaintiffs seek to have the court enjoin operations at four corners until aps applies for and obtains any required psd permits and complies with the nsps the plaintiffs further request the court to order the payment of civil penalties including a beneficial mitigation project aps believes the claims in this matter are without merit and will vigorously defend against them 

  

endangered species act on january 30 2011 the center for biological diversity dine citizens against ruining our environment and san juan citizens alliance filed a lawsuit against the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement “osm” and the doi alleging that osm failed to engage in mandatory endangered species act “esa” consultation with the fish and wildlife service prior to authorizing the renewal of an operating permit for the mine that serves four corners the lawsuit alleges that activities at the mine including mining and the disposal of coal combustion residue will adversely affect several endangered species and their critical habitats the lawsuit requests the court to vacate and remand the mining permit and enjoin all activities carried out under the permit until osm has complied with the esa although we are not a party to the lawsuit we continue to evaluate the lawsuit to determine its potential impact on plant operations 

  

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with the epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan aps estimates that its costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 1 million we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time we cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures 

  

manufactured gas plant sites   certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

navajo nation environmental issues 

  

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

  

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

  

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  

water supply 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

  

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps operations 

  

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require 

  

  

a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

  

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  

little colorado river adjudication aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  

a number of parties including aps the navajo nation the hopi tribe and other claimants in the little colorado river adjudication have been engaged in settlement negotiations to resolve competing water claims on june 3 2011 counsel for all the parties to the settlement discussions including aps signed on behalf of their respective clients a document expressing their agreement to recommend that the settlement be approved by their respective clients negotiations among the parties continue if ultimately approved by the parties the united states congress and the arizona legislature aps believes this settlement would be beneficial in protecting aps’s interest through its resolution of any and all claims that the navajo nation and the hopi tribe may have to the little colorado river system and source in arizona 

  

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation or settlement will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

business of other subsidiaries 

  

the operations of our other firsttier subsidiaries described below are not expected to contribute in any material way to our future financial performance nor will they require any material amounts of capital over the next three years we continue to focus on our core utility business and streamlining the company in august 2011 we sold our competitive energy services subsidiary apses for an after tax gain of 10 million 

  

el dorado 

  

el dorado owns minority interests in several energyrelated investments and arizona communitybased ventures el dorado’s shortterm goal is to prudently realize the value of its existing investments as of december 31 2011 el dorado had total assets of 20 million 

  

suncor 

  

suncor was a developer of residential commercial and industrial real estate projects in arizona idaho new mexico and utah due to the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets in 2009 suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt as of december 31 2011 suncor had no existing bank debt and had total assets remaining on its books of 9 million consisting of 7 million of intercompany receivables and 2 million of other assets on february 24 2012 suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of arizona to complete an orderly liquidation of its business we do not expect suncor’s bankruptcy to have a material impact on pinnacle west’s financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

  

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and the ferc arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify final orders under certain circumstances the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc or the ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes regulations and acc requirements and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

  

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including the ferc the nrc the epa the acc and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards in addition to penalties aps may be unable to recover certain costs if for example it fails to implement any of its annual accapproved renewable implementation plans aps is also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

  

  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

  

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on existing and new facilities as a result of the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan various industry organizations are working to analyze information from the japan incident and develop action plans for us nuclear power plants additionally the nrc is performing its own independent review of the events at fukushima daiichi including a review of the agency’s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the nrc’s system of regulation we cannot predict when or if the nrc will take formal action as a result of its review the financial andor operational impacts on palo verde and aps may be significant 

  

in the event of noncompliance with its requirements the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

  

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

  

  

regional haze   aps is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from the epa that could impose new requirements on four corners and the navajo plant aps is also awaiting the epa’s issuance of a fip or partial fip that could impose new requirements on cholla the epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants depending upon the agencies’ final determinations of what constitutes bart for these plants the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of the plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants resulting in plant closures and asset impairments 

  

coal ash the epa released proposed regulations governing the disposal of ccrs which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the epa proposed regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous or hazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products if the epa regulates ccrs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps’s ability to dispose of ccrs through the use of ash ponds aps could incur significant costs for ccr disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 

  

new source review the epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger new source review requirements under the clean air act the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not result in emissions increases and thus are not subject to new source review in 2009 aps received and responded to a request from the epa regarding projects and operations of four corners an environmental organization filed suit against the four corners participants for alleged violations of new source review and the nsps programs of the clean air act if the epa seeks to impose new source review requirements at four corners or any other aps plant or if the citizens’ group prevails in its lawsuit significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies the epa could also seek civil penalties 

  

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

  

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions in addition lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases including a lawsuit filed by the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change 

  

financial risks — potential legislation and regulation  it is possible that some form of legislation or epa action to regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions may occur in the future at the 

  

  

federal level if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which aps operates ultimately pass legislation or if the epa promulgates additional regulations regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases any resulting limitations on co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossilfuelfired generation facilities particularly coalfired facilities which constitute approximately 28 of aps’s generation capacity 

  

at the state level the california legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas emissions and the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a capandtrade program for greenhouse gas this legislation regulation and other statespecific initiatives may affect aps’s business including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants including four corners following 2016 

  

physical and operational risks   weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

  

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

  

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers as a result aps cannot predict if when and the extent to which additional competitors may reenter aps’s service territory 

  

in 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model the use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors “public service corporations” subject to acc regulation and when and the extent to which additional service providers will enter aps’s service territory increasing the level of competition in the market 

  

operational risks 

  

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

  

weather conditions   weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in 

  

  

arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy   the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the proposed settlement agreement in aps’s current retail rate case includes a mechanism to address these matters the 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement also established energy efficiency goals for aps that began in 2010 that extend through 2012 subjecting aps to energy efficiency requirements slightly greater for the first two of those years than required under the rules described above 

  

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement was 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increased to 30 of the applicable res requirement for 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs 

  

reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless offset through ratemaking mechanisms such as those proposed in the settlement agreement could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

  

the operation of power generation transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  

  

the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet new or evolving standards and regulations could adversely impact our business 

  

potential changes in regulatory standards impacts of new and existing laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations and the need to obtain certain regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio for example aps’s acquisition of sce’s interest in four corners is contingent upon regulatory approval if not approved we could face increased costs for replacement power or the need to acquire or develop alternate resources in addition aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements and the res the development of any renewable generation facilities resulting from the res is subject to many other risks including risks related to financing siting permitting technology the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources aps’s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources to meet the required standards could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

  

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the region in which aps’s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

  

certain aps power plants including four corners and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is currently unable to predict the final outcome of pending and future approvals by applicable governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

  

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

  

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage 

  

  

to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 118 million but not more than 18 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures andor increase operating costs 

  

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” which was signed into law in july 2010 contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

  

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

  

research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption including clean coal and coal gasification renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation solar and efficiency technologies and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’s existing generating facilities less economical in addition advances in technology and equipmentappliance efficiency could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’s business 

  

  

aps is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers and electric usage monitoring devices for customers’ homes and businesses many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested and their use on largescale systems is not as advanced and established as aps’s existing technologies and equipment uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect aps’s business if national standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to perform as expected in addition widespread installation and acceptance of these devices could enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers 

  

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is aging and a number of our employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we may not be successful we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages exposure to these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems  

  

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security customer and business systems information we are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including confidential customer employee financial or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures our technology systems are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access our generation transmission and distribution facilities information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the implementation of security measures and cost of insurance addressing such activities could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect pinnacle west’s and aps’s reputation with customers and the public 

  

  

financial risks 

  

financial market disruptions or new financial rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

  

we rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may increase our cost of borrowing generally andor otherwise adversely affect our ability to access the credit markets 

  

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons including periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

  

changes in economic conditions monetary policy or other factors could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

  

·   causing a downgrade of our credit ratings 

·   increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing 

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and 

·   requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce funds available to us for operations future business opportunities or other purposes 

  

a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  

  

investment performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase the valuation of our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding requirements any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 

  

we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise declines in market values or poor investment results may adversely affect the values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts and increase our funding requirements additionally the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates decrease the discount rate increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans the minimum contributions required under these plans have increased and could continue to do so resulting in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

we may be required to adopt ifrs the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board “iasb” that is being considered by the sec to replace accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” for use in preparation of financial statements if the sec requires mandatory adoption of ifrs we may lose our ability to use regulatory accounting treatment and would follow ifrs rather than gaap for the preparation of our financial statements beginning no earlier than 2015 in the meantime the fasb and the iasb are working on several accounting standards jointly to converge certain accounting differences the implementation and adoption of these new standards and the inability to use regulatory accounting could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our cash flow largely depends on the performance of aps 

  

we conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiary aps essentially all of our consolidated assets are held by aps accordingly our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

  

aps’s debt agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  

  

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

  

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

·   variations in our quarterly operating results 

·   operating results that vary from the expectations of management securities analysts and investors 

·   changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

·   developments generally affecting industries in which we operate particularly the energy distribution and energy generation industries 

·   announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures or capital commitments 

·   announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us 

·   favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments 

·   our dividend policy 

·   future sales by the company of equity or equitylinked securities and 

·   general domestic and international economic conditions 

  

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

  

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination” transactions with an “interested shareholder” generally any person who owns 10 or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met 

  

·   antigreenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5 of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied 

  

  

·   the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of the board and fill vacancies on the board whether resulting from such increase or from death resignation disqualification or otherwise and 

  

·   the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and with respect to preferred stock the other terms including preferences and voting rights of those shares without shareholder approval 

  

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

  

suncor’s continuing winddown of its real estate business may give rise to various claims 

  

since 2009 suncor has been engaged in a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt suncor is focusing on concluding an orderly winddown of its business this effort includes addressing contingent liabilities such as warranty and construction claims that may be brought by property owners and potential funding obligations to local taxing districts that financed infrastructure at certain of its real estate developments 

  

pinnacle west has not guaranteed any of suncor’s obligations suncor’s remaining business operations and its ability to generate cash from operations are minimal in february 2012 suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business pinnacle west could be exposed to the uncertainties and complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2011 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

transmission and distribution facilities 

  

current facilities  aps’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 5866 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5643 miles of which are located in arizona aps’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11376 miles of overhead lines and approximately 17561 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 

  

   

expansion   each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2012 plan aps projects it will invest approximately 550 million in new transmission projects 115 kv and above over the next ten years which includes 269 miles of new lines this investment will increase the import capability into metropolitan phoenix and the yuma area one significant project currently under development is a new 500kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix the project consists of four phases the first phase morgan to pinnacle peak 500kv is currently inservice the second phase delaney to palo verde 

  

  

500kv is under construction the third and fourth phases delaney to sun valley 500kv and morgan to sun valley 500kv have been permitted and are in various stages of final design and development in total the projects consist of over 100 miles of new 500kv lines with many of those miles constructed as capable of stringing a 230kv line as a second circuit 

  

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’s 2012 transmission plan are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to palo verde line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california 

  

plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands 

  

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under easements from the federal government the easement and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for four corners expire in 2016 on march 7 2011 the navajo nation council signed a resolution approving a 25year extension to the existing four corners lease term and providing navajo nation consent to renewal of the related easements aps is now preparing to file applications for renewal of these easements with the doi before it may approve the four corners lease extension and issue the renewed easements the united states must complete an analysis under the federal national environmental policy act the esa and related statutes 

  

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation in march 2011 the navajo nation provided its consent to renew the easements for the transmission lines specified in the lease extension however some of our easements are not covered by the leases or are granted by other indian tribes in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rightsofway certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway or that are typical for similar permits across nonindian lands however we are unaware of the underlying agreements andor specific circumstances surrounding these renewals the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines not addressed in the lease extension is uncertain we are monitoring these easement issues and have had extensive discussions with the navajo nation regarding the easements we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis 

of financial condition and results of operations 

  

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

  

areas of business focus 

  

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

  

nuclear in 2011 palo verde achieved its best generation year ever producing over 31 million megawatthours with an overall station capacity factor of 907 in 2011 palo verde successfully refueled both unit 1 and unit 2 in april 2011 the nrc approved aps’s application for renewed operating licenses for the palo verde units extending the licenses for units 1 2 and 3 to june 2045 april 2046 and november 2047 respectively aps management is working closely with regulators and others in the nuclear industry to analyze the lessons learned and address any rulemaking or improvements resulting from the march 2011 events impacting the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan 

  

coal and related environmental matters apsoperated coal plants four corners and cholla achieved net capacity factors of 78 and 82 respectively in 2011 aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning greenhouse gas emissions concern over climate change and other emissionrelated issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants aps is closely monitoring its longrange capital management plans understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades 

  

in addition sce a participant in four corners has indicated that certain california legislation may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the purchase price is 294 million subject to certain adjustments completion of the purchase by aps which is expected to occur in the second half of 2012 is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” and the ferc aps and sce filed applications with their respective commissions seeking requisite authority or approvals to complete the transaction on february 17 2012 the cpuc issued a proposed decision approving the sale with a final decision expected in march closing is also conditioned on the execution of a new coal supply 

  

  

contract expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act and other typical closing conditions hearings at the acc concluded on september 1 2011 we expect the administrative law judge to issue a recommended decision in early 2012 

  

aps on behalf of the four corners participants has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which would extend the four corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041 execution by the navajo nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by aps of sce’s interests in four corners the execution of these amendments by the navajo nation requires the approval of the navajo nation council which became effective in march 2011 the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants will pursue a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process 

  

aps has announced that if aps’s purchase of sce’s interests in units 4 and 5 at four corners is consummated it will close units 1 2 and 3 at the plant aps owns 100 of units 13 these events will change the plant’s overall generating capacity from 2100 mw to 1540 mw and aps’s entitlement from the plant from 791 mw to 970 mw when applying for approval to purchase units 4 and 5 aps also requested from the acc recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of units 1 2 and 3 the proposed settlement agreement in aps’s current retail rate case allows for the case to remain open to allow aps to seek a rate adjustment to reflect the four corners transaction should the acc allow aps to pursue the acquisition and should the transaction thereafter close 

  

aps cannot predict whether all of the conditions necessary to consummate the purchase of sce’s interest will be met such that closing can occur including whether the parties will receive satisfactory regulatory approvals 

  

transmission and delivery in the area of transmission and delivery to its customers aps had its best reliability year to date and ranked favorably during 2011 with top quartile performance for average annual customer outage time and average annual customer interruptions aps’s 2012 tenyear transmission plan filed with the acc in january 2012 projects that it will invest approximately 550 million in new transmission projects 115 kv and above over the next ten years adding 269 miles of new lines the first three years of these additions are included in the capital expenditures table presented in the “liquidity and capital resources” section below along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology throughout its service territory designed to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is piloting and deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations and the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

  

renewable energy  the acc approved the res in 2006 the renewable energy requirement is 35 of retail electric sales in 2012 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in the settlement agreement related to the 2008 retail rate case aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to 1700 gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be 3400 gwh or approximately 10 of aps’s retail energy sales by yearend 2015 which is double the existing res target of 5 for that year a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of 

  

  

distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties 

  

aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 946 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 423 mw are currently in operation and 523 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 55 mw of utilityscale facilities owned by aps 232 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 136 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

  

to achieve our res requirements as mentioned above to date aps has entered into contracts for 523 mw of renewable resources that are planned in development or under construction aps’s strategy to procure these resources includes new facilities to be owned by aps purchased power contracts for new facilities and ongoing development of distributed energy resources through the az sun program aps plans to own up to 200 mw of solar photovoltaic power plants across arizona by investing up to 975 million through 2015 under this program aps has executed contracts for the development of 83 mw of new solar generation representing an investment commitment of approximately 375 million see note 3 for additional details of the az sun program including the related cost recovery aps has also entered into longterm purchased power agreements for 397 mw from solar wind and biogas facilities currently planned in development or under construction and 93 mw from distributed energy resources agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid 

  

on july 1 2011 aps filed its annual res implementation plan with the acc covering the 20122016 timeframe and requesting 2012 res funding of 129 million to 152 million on december 14 2011 the acc voted to approve aps’s 2012 res plan and authorized a total 2012 res budget of 110 million  within that budget the acc authorized aps to among other items i own an additional 100 mw under the az sun program for a total of 200 mw ii recover revenue requirements for the second 100 mw as aps did for the first 100 mw of the az sun program iii expand aps’s school and government program by another 625 mw of utilityowned distributed generation and iv own another 25 mw of renewable generation to be described later and installed in 2014 and 2015 in addition the acc ordered an initial up front incentive of 075 per watt for residential distributed energy and incentive level step downs throughout 2012 based upon the volume and timing of residential incentive applications under the acc’s order residential incentives could fall to 020 or 010 per watt by the end of 2012 depending on demand 

  

demand side management in recent years arizona regulators have placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives on july 27 2010 the proposed energy efficiency standard was adopted by the acc approved by the arizona attorney general and became effective on january 1 2011 this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs on june 1 2011 aps filed its 2012 energy efficiency implementation plan with a proposed budget for 2012 of 90 million aps expects a decision from the acc prior to march 31 2012 however aps cannot predict whether the acc will approve the plan as filed 

  

  

rate matters aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc on june 1 2011 aps filed a rate case with the acc requesting among other things an increase in retail rates to allow aps to continue to maintain and upgrade its electric systems for enhanced reliability approval of recovery mechanisms including a decoupling mechanism and approval of other programs and mechanisms aimed at energy efficiency and renewable energy on january 6 2012 aps and other parties to the retail rate case entered into a settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case the settlement agreement requires the approval of the acc as is the case with all such agreements aps cannot predict whether the settlement agreement will be approved in the form filed or what changes may be ordered by the acc and accepted by the parties the proposed settlement agreement demonstrates cooperation among aps the acc staff the residential utility consumer office and other intervenors to the rate case and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows aps the opportunity to help shape arizona’s energy future outside of continual rate cases see note 3 for details regarding the current rate case the settlement agreement terms and for information on aps’s ferc rates 

  

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demandside management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

  

financial strength and flexibility pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company in february 2011 aps entered into a 500 million revolving credit facility replacing its 489 million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in september 2011 in november 2011 pinnacle west and aps refinanced their 200 million and 500 million revolving credit facilities respectively that would have otherwise matured in february 2013 

  

in august 2011 aps issued 300 million of 505 unsecured senior notes that mature on september 1 2041 the net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used along with cash on hand to repay at maturity aps’s 400 million aggregate principal amount of 6375 senior notes due october 15 2011 in january 2012 aps issued 325 million of 450 unsecured senior notes that mature on april 1 2042 aps will use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes along with other funds to pay at maturity its 375 million aggregate principal amount of 650 unsecured senior notes that mature on march 1 2012 

  

apses   on august 19 2011 pinnacle west sold its investment in apses the sale resulted in an aftertax gain of approximately 10 million 

  

other subsidiaries   the operations of el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets during 2009 our other firsttier subsidiary suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt at december 31 2011 suncor had total remaining assets of about 9 million including 7 million of intercompany receivables and no debt in february 2012 suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business we do not expect suncor’s bankruptcy to have a material impact on pinnacle west’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

key financial drivers 

  

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

  

electric operating revenues   for the years 2009 through 2011 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps’s retail customers through the psa these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

  

customer and sales growth retail customer growth in aps’s service territory for the year ended december 31 2011 was 04 compared with the prior year for the three years 2009 through 2011 aps’s customer growth averaged 06 per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 16 for 2012 through 2014 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona retail electricity sales in kilowatthours adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations for the year ended 2011 increased 06 compared with the prior year reflecting mildly improving economic conditions partially offset by the effects of our energy efficiency programs for the three years 2009 through 2011 aps experienced annual declines in retail electricity sales averaging 09 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will remain flat on average during 2012 through 2014 including the effects of aps’s energy efficiency programs but excluding the effects of weather variations the failure of the arizona economy to rebound in the near future could further impact these estimates 

  

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns impacts of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

weather   in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  

fuel and purchased power costs   fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

  

  

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues and other factors in the settlement agreement related to the 2008 retail rate case aps committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through 2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases to be incurred in 2011 and 2012 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses   depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities with the twentyyear extensions of the operating licenses for each of the palo verde units recently granted by the nrc we estimate that our pretax depreciation expense will decrease by approximately 34 million per year starting on january 1 2012 

  

property taxes   taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate in arizona for aps which owns essentially all of our property was 90 of the assessed value for 2011 80 for 2010 and 75 for 2009 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units transmission and distribution facilities see note 3 for property tax deferrals proposed in the settlement agreement 

  

income taxes    income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates and certain nontaxable items such as the afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

  

interest expense   interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

  

results of operations 

  

pinnacle west’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electricity service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

  

apses’s and suncor’s operations have been classified as discontinued operations pinnacle west sold its investment in apses in august 2011 

  

operating results — 2011 compared with 2010 

  

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2011 was 339 million compared with net income of 350 million for the prior year the 11 million net decrease consisted of a 14 million decrease in income from discontinued operations and a 3 million increase in income from continuing operations primarily related to the regulated electricity 

  

  

segment regulated electricity segment results reflect increased revenues related to weather and higher retail transmission charges and decreased operations and maintenance expenses these positive factors were offset by higher depreciation and amortization due to increased plant in service higher property taxes due to increased property tax rates and higher income taxes including income tax benefits recognized in the prior year 

  

in addition income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2011 included a gain of approximately 10 million after income taxes related to the sale of our investment in apses income from discontinued operations in the prior year was due to a 25 million gain after income taxes related to the sale of apses’s district cooling business 

  

the following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior year 

  

   

a   includes effects of 2011 settlement of certain priorperiod transmission rightsofway related to four corners which did not affect net income but increased both electric operating revenues and operations and maintenance expenses by 28 million costs related to the settlement were offset by related revenues from sce which leases the related transmission line from aps 

  

  

b   operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses includes amounts related to demandside management renewable energy and similar regulatory surcharges which were substantially offset in operations and maintenance 

  

c   includes activities related to apses and suncor

taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the current period 

  

income taxes income taxes were 23 million higher for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the prior year this increase was primarily due to the effects of higher pretax income in the current year and income tax benefits recognized in the prior year related to a reduction in the company’s 2010 effective income tax rate 

  

discontinued operations 

  

income from discontinued operations for year ended december 31 2011 included a gain of 10 million related to the sale of our investment in apses income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2010 included an after tax gain of 25 million related to the sale of apses’s district cooling business 

  

operating results — 2010 compared with 2009 

  

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2010 was 350 million compared with 68 million for the comparable prioryear period the improved results were primarily due to lower real estate impairment charges recorded in 2010 compared with the prioryear period by suncor 

  

in addition regulated electricity segment net income increased approximately 82 million from the prioryear period due to increased revenues related to aps’s retail rate increases and other factors our consolidated results for 2010 also include a gain of 25 million after income taxes related to the sale of apses’s district cooling business 

  

  

the following table presents net income loss attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prioryear period

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 164 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year the following table describes the major components of this change 

  

   

operations and maintenance   operations and maintenance expenses increased 48 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

  

·   an increase of 25 million related to demandside management and renewable energy programs which are primarily offset in operating revenues

·   an increase of 5 million related to other miscellaneous factors 

  

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were 8 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of increased plant in service partially offset by lower depreciation rates 

  

taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased 12 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the current year 

  

  

interest charges net of allowance for funds used during construction interest charges net of allowance for funds used during construction decreased 8 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher rates in the current year for the allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction partially offset by higher interest charges due to higher debt balances interest charges net of allowance for funds used during construction are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the line items interest expense and allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction from the consolidated statements of income 

  

income taxes income taxes were 19 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher pretax income in the currentyear period partially offset by 17 million of income tax benefits related to prior years that were resolved in the current year see note 4 

  

all other   all other increased 6 million primarily as a result of higher other income due to investment losses at el dorado in 2009 

  

discontinued operations 

  

real estate activities during the first quarter of 2009 suncor’s board of directors authorized a series of strategic transactions to dispose of suncor’s assets this decision resulted in impairment charges of approximately 161 million after income taxes in 2009 as of december 31 2010 all of suncor’s operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations see note 21 the aftertax impacts of the 6 million loss from real estate activities for the year ended 2010 includes real estate impairment charges of approximately 10 million see note 22 and other costs of 6 million partially offset by a gain from debt restructuring of approximately 10 million

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

pinnacle west’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration of our board of directors based on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

  

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external debt and equity issuances  an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2011 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 55 its total shareholder equity was approximately 39 billion and total capitalization was approximately 72 billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if the payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 29 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements 

  

  

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west 

  

many of aps’s current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 includes provisions making qualified property placed into service after september 8 2010 and before january 1 2012 eligible for 100 bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes in addition qualified property placed into service in 2012 is eligible for 50 bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes these provisions of the recent tax legislation are expected to generate approximately 425475 million of cash tax benefits for aps through accelerated depreciation it is anticipated that these cash benefits will be fully realized by aps by the end of 2013 with a majority of the benefit realized in 2012 the cash generated is an acceleration of tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over 20 years

a   primarily information systems and facilities projects 

  

generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’s existing fossil and nuclear plants examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment included under renewables is the az sun program which is a significant component of the increase in capital expenditures from 2010 to 2011 in addition renewables reflects capital funding from the 2012 res implementation plan which was approved by the acc on december 14 2011 for purposes of this table we have assumed the consummation of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 subject to acc approval and the subsequent shut down of units 13 as discussed in the “overview” section above as a result we included the 294 million purchase price plus adjustments under generation and have not included environmental expenditures for units 13 we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters which depending on their final outcome could require modification to our environmental expenditures 

  

distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements and new customer construction examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines substations and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments

debt provisions 

  

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2011 the ratio was approximately 47 for pinnacle west and 46 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

  

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings

credit ratings 

  

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 15 2012 are shown below we are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of shortterm and longterm capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and longterm debt the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’s securities andor result in an increase in the cost of or limit access to capital such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments insurance policies natural gas transportation 

  

  

fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts at this time we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover a downward revision to our credit ratings

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2011 dollars in millions 

  

   

a   the longterm debt matures at various dates through 2041 and bears interest principally at fixed rates interest on variablerate longterm debt is determined by using average rates at december 31 2011 see note 6

c   contracts to purchase renewable energy credits in compliance with the res 

d   these contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other obligations these amounts do not include the purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 due to additional approvals required see discussion in “overview” 

  

this table excludes 136 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain this table also excludes approximately 65 million 160 million and 160 million in estimated minimum pension contributions for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively see note 8 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  

  

regulatory accounting 

  

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 14 billion of regulatory assets and 826 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 

  

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2011 is a regulatory asset of 10 billion for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

  

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

  

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2011 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2011 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

  

   

  

a   each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point 

  

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2011 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2011 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

  

   

a   each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point 

b   this assumes a 1 change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate 

  

see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  

derivative accounting 

  

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we use accrual accounting for derivative instruments designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met when a derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is recognized in current earnings 

  

see “market risks — commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see “fair value measurements” below for additional information on valuation see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting 

  

  

fair value measurements 

  

we account for derivative instruments investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion 

  

other accounting matters 

  

see note 2 for discussion regarding the adoption of amended accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2012 relating to fair value measurements and disclosures and the presentation of comprehensive income 

  

market and credit risks 

  

market risks 

  

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 

  

interest rate and equity risk 

  

we have exposure to changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 14 the nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks associated with the changing market value of its investments nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

commodity price risk 

  

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas our risk management committee consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 

  

the following table shows the net pretax changes in marktomarket of our derivative positions in 2011 and 2010 dollars in millions 

  

  

   

a   the changes in marktomarket recorded in oci are due primarily to changes in forward natural gas prices 

  

the table below shows the fair value of maturities of our derivative contracts dollars in millions at december 31 2011 by maturities and by the type of valuation that is performed to calculate the fair values see note 1 “derivative accounting” and “fair value measurements” for more discussion of our valuation methods 

  

   

the table below shows the impact that hypothetical price movements of 10 would have on the market value of our risk management assets and liabilities included on pinnacle west’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010 dollars in millions 

  

  

   

a   these contracts are hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity the impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged to the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the psa the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability

pinnacle west’s other firsttier subsidiaries are suncor apses and el dorado additional information related to these businesses is provided later in this report 

our reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution in 2009 our realestate subsidiary suncor began disposing of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt see note 23 all of suncor’s operations are reflected as discontinued operations as a result the real estate segment is no longer a reportable segment see note 17 for financial information of our business segments 

business of arizona public service company 

aps currently provides electric service to approximately 11 million customers we own or lease more than 6290 mw of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both longterm and shortterm purchased power agreements for additional capacity including a variety of agreements for the purchase of renewable energy during 2010 no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 12 of our electric revenues

energy sources and resource planning 

to serve its customers aps obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements resource planning is an important function necessary to meet arizona’s future energy needs aps’s sources of energy by fuel type during 2010 were as follows 

generation facilities 

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2 

coal fueled generating facilities 

four corners — four corners is a 5unit coalfired power plant located in the northwestern corner of new mexico aps operates the plant and owns 100 of four corners units 1 2 and 3 and 15 of units 4 and 5 aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 791 mw the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government aps purchases all of four corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a longterm lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation the four corners coal contract runs through 2016 

on november 8 2010 aps and southern california edison “sce” entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners if consummated aps would acquire 739 mw from sce unless any of the other owners of interests in units 4 and 5 exercise their rights of first refusal prior to march 8 2011 in which case aps would not be able to purchase sce’s entire share of the units completion of the purchase by aps which is expected to occur in the second half of 2012 is conditioned upon the receipt of regulatory approvals from the acc the california public utilities commission and the ferc the execution of a new coal supply contract for a lease renewal period described below expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act and other typical closing conditions 

  5 

aps on behalf of the four corners participants has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which would extend the four corners leasehold interest to 2041 execution by the navajo nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by aps of sce’s interests in four corners the execution of these amendments by the navajo nation requires the approval of the navajo nation council which occurred on february 15 2011 and is awaiting final signature by the nation’s president the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the us department of the interior “doi” as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants will pursue a federal environmental review will be conducted as part of the doi review process 

aps has announced that if aps’s purchase of sce’s interests in units 4 and 5 at four corners is consummated it will close units 1 2 and 3 at the plant these events will change the plant’s overall generating capacity from 2100 mw to 1540 mw and aps’s entitlement from the plant from 791 mw to 970 mw

palo verde fuel cycle — the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2011 and 95 of its requirements through 2017 a new contract is currently being negotiated that will cover palo verde’s remaining requirements for uranium concentrates through 2017 the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s conversion services through 2018 all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2020 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2016 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 “nwpa” required the doe to accept transport and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998 the doe’s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel andor highlevel radioactive waste “standard contract” with each nuclear power plant the doe failed to begin accepting palo verde’s spent nuclear fuel by 1998 and aps on behalf of itself and the other palo verde participants filed a lawsuit for doe’s breach of the palo verde standard contract in the us court of federal claims the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and in october 2010 awarded 302 million in damages to the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 2006

the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing licensing constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain nevada in june 2008 doe submitted its application to the nrc to authorize construction of the yucca mountain repository in march 2010 the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its yucca mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the nrc several interested parties have intervened in the nrc proceeding and the proceeding has not been conclusively decided by the nrc or the courts additionally a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe’s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application none of these lawsuits have been conclusively decided by the courts 

palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period which ends in december 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation which ends in december 2047 assuming the nrc approves aps’s request for renewed operating licenses as discussed above if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 

in addition to the spent fuel stored at palo verde’s onsite isfsi palo verde also generates certain types of low level radioactive waste that are stored onsite currently the class b and class c waste the higher radioactivity of the low level wastes is stored onsite since industry access to a disposal site was eliminated several years ago the nrc is considering regulations that would allow the industry to eliminate much of this waste by blending it with lower level class a waste so that it can be disposed of at a facility such as the one palo verde utilizes in utah 

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’s acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge one paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism see note 12 for additional information about aps’s nuclear decommissioning costs 

palo verde liability and insurance matters — see “palo verde nuclear generating station — nuclear insurance” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near the palo verde nuclear generating station ocotillo located in tempe sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at saguaro and yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oil only power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one combustion turbine unit and one steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3389 mw gas for these plants is acquired through aps’s hedging program aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies some of which are effective through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’s other oil power plants by truck

solar facilities 

aps owns and operates more than sixty small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce about 5 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems includes a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport a 1 mw facility located at aps’s saguaro power plant and less than 1 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff arizona the community power project approved by the acc on april 1 2010 is a pilot program through which upon completion aps will own operate and receive energy from approximately 15 mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff arizona 

purchased power contracts 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a substantial portion of aps’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 18 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability aps does not expect to require new conventional generation sources sooner than 2017 due primarily to planned additions of renewable resources and energy efficiency initiatives 

purchased power capacity — aps’s purchased power capacity under longterm contracts including its renewable energy portfolio is summarized in the tables below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted

 current and future resources 

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’s 2010 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 15 2010 at 6936 mw compared to the 2009 peak of 7218 mw recorded on july 27 2009 aps’s operable generating capacity together with firm purchases totaling 2974 mw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases resulted in an actual reserve margin at the time of the 2010 peak demand of 218 the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages 

future resources and resource plan 

under the acc’s modified resource planning rule aps will file by april 1 st of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteenyear period the acc’s modified rule also requires aps to file its first resource plan within 120 days after the rule becomes effective the modified rule became effective in january 2011 and aps will likely file a resource plan in the first quarter of 2011 the modified rule also requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal the acc’s acknowledgment of aps’s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of electric energy services demand management analysis of supplyside options system reliability and risk management

renewable energy standard 

in 2006 the acc adopted the res under the res electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 3 of retail electric sales in 2011 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement aps committed to have 1700 gwh of new renewable resources in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be 3400 gwh or approximately 10 of retail sales by yearend 2015 which is double the existing res target of 5 for that year see note 3 a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties accordingly under the res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increases to 30 of the applicable res requirement in 2012 and subsequent years the following table summarizes these requirement standards and their timing 

 

renewable energy portfolio aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 875 mw including wind geothermal solar biomass and biogas of this portfolio 288 mw are currently in operation and 587 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 5 mw of facilities owned by aps 223 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 60 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio both to ensure its compliance with the res and to meet the needs of its customer base aps’s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps one of the key programs under which aps will own solar resources is the “az sun program” as approved by the acc the az sun program will allow aps to own 100 mw of solar photovoltaic power plants across arizona by investing up to 500 million through 2014 under this program to date aps has executed contracts for the development of 83 mw of new solar generation representing an investment commitment of approximately 377 million see note 3 for additional details about the az sun program including the related cost recovery 

the following table summarizes aps’s renewable energy sources in operation and under development agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid

demand side management 

arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 this standard was adopted and became effective on january 1 2011 this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs see note 3 for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from aps’s 2009 retail rate case settlement 

economic stimulus projects 

through the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs by using economic stimulus funding certain programs are also available through the state of arizona 

in 2009 the doe announced an arra commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide emission reduction research and development project in the amount of 71 million which was to be located at our cholla power plant due to the increased resource and funding requirements for a project of that size aps elected not to move forward with that award and is now in the process of closing out the project however aps is moving forward with work under the 3 million award from doe for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff arizona the funding under this doe award will continue to be contingent upon meeting certain project milestones including doeestablished budget parameters over the next four years 

aps is also continuing its work as a subrecipient under an arra award received through the state of arizona’s department of commerce this approximately 4 million award is for the implementation of various distributed energy and energy efficiency programs in arizona aps will be implementing certain solar water heater and photovoltaicrelated community projects under this award 

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

retail 

the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer or encumbrance of aps’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

  13 

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers in 2000 the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision 

to date the acc has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision in 2008 the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august 12 2010 the report stated that additional analysis discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 

on april 14 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’s service territory 

  14 

wholesale 

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’s transmission rates during 2010 approximately 58 of aps’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’s native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps markets hedges and trades in electricity and fuels 

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative initiatives in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 the house of representatives passed a comprehensive energy and climate change bill but the senate did not consider it or a similar bill in the 111 th congress with much focus on the economy it is unclear when congress will consider another global warming bill the actual economic and operational impact of any legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until such legislation passes and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance at the present time we cannot predict what form of legislation if any will ultimately pass 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives statespecific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has not yet enacted any statespecific legislation regarding greenhouse gas emissions the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address greenhouse gas emissions in december 2010 the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a capandtrade program for greenhouse gas emissions which is scheduled to be launched in 2012 as part of the state’s program implementing ab32 in addition the new mexico environmental improvement board recently enacted a greenhouse gas capandtrade program and emissions cap to become effective in 2012 and 2013 respectively 

we are monitoring these and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants in particular sce a participant in four corners has indicated that sb 1368 may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities — four corners” above for details of the pending sale of sce’s interest in four corners to aps 

  15 

regulatory initiatives in december 2009 the epa determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act as a result of the endangerment finding the epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources including power plants on june 3 2010 the epa issued a rule under the clean air act known as the “tailoring rule” establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when sources including power plants must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits new source review is a preconstruction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source the tailoring rule became effective on august 2 2010 and it became applicable to power plants on january 2 2011 several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the epa’s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule 

aps does not expect the tailoring rule to have a significant impact on its current operations the rule will require aps to consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions as part of its traditional new source review analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants at the present time we cannot predict what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from the epa’s endangerment finding whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding or the tailoring rule will be successful and what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps’s operations 

on december 30 2010 pursuant to its authority under the clean air act the epa finalized a greenhouse gas federal implementation plan “fip” for arizona relating to preconstruction permits for construction of new sources or major modifications of existing sources as a result of this action effective january 2 2011 the epa assumed responsibility for acting on permit applications for only the greenhouse gas portion of such preconstruction permits state permitting authorities will continue to retain responsibility for the remaining parts of preconstruction permits that are unrelated to emissions of greenhouse gasses to the extent arizona seeks and receives from the epa a delegation of permitting authority for greenhouse gas emissions the state will assume responsibility for issuing both the greenhouse gas and nongreenhouse gas portions of preconstruction permits the greenhouse gas fip will remain in place until such time as the epa approves a state implementation plan that applies preconstruction permit requirements to greenhouse gasemitting stationary sources in arizona aps does not expect the greenhouse gas fip to have a significant impact on its current operations 

the epa also recently announced its intent to promulgate new source performance standards “nsps” for greenhouse gas emissions from certain industrial facilities under the clean air act the epa intends to propose the new standards by july 2011 and to finalize them by may 2012 the epa has indicated that the rules will apply to coalfired electric generating units “egus” and will establish nsps for new and modified egus and emission guidelines for existing egus the rules are expected to apply to the four corners cholla and the navajo plant we cannot currently predict the impact of these rules on aps’s operations 

if any emission reduction legislation or additional regulations are enacted we will assess our compliance alternatives which may include replacement of existing equipment installation of additional pollution control equipment purchase of allowances retirement or suspension of operations at certain coalfired facilities or other actions although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation could be material we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our rates 

  16 

regional initiative  in 2007 six western states arizona california new mexico oregon utah and washington and two canadian provinces british columbia and manitoba entered into an accord the western climate initiative “wci” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and certain industries including utilities montana quebec and ontario have also joined wci wci participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 15 below 2005 levels by 2020 after soliciting public comment in september 2008 wci issued the design of a capandtrade program for greenhouse gas emissions due in part to the recent activity at the federal level discussed above the initiative’s momentum and the movement toward detailed proposed rules has slowed on february 2 2010 arizona’s governor issued an executive order stating that arizona will continue to be a member of wci to monitor its advancements in this area but it will not implement the wci regional capandtrade program as a result while we continue to monitor the progress of wci at the present time we do not believe it will have a material impact on our operations 

company response to climate change initiatives  we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency see “energy sources and resource planning — current and future resources” above for details of these plans and initiatives aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources 

in january 2008 aps joined the climate registry as a founding reporter founding reporters are companies that voluntarily joined the nonprofit organization before may 2008 to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions in a common accurate and transparent manner consistent across industry sectors and borders beginning in 2010 aps stopped participating in the climate registry because aps began reporting substantially the same information under the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule issued by the epa on september 22 2009 pinnacle west prepares an annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom   the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

climate change lawsuits in february 2008 the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california against nine oil companies fourteen power companies including pinnacle west and a coal company alleging that the defendants’ emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and constitute a public and private nuisance the plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages in june 2008 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action which were granted the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeals in november 2009 and pinnacle west filed its reply on june 30 2010 the court has not yet scheduled oral arguments on the plaintiffs’ appeal we believe the action is without merit and intend to continue to defend against the claims 

a similar nuisance lawsuit american electric power co inc v connecticut is currently pending in the united states supreme court another such lawsuit was dismissed by the fifth circuit on procedural grounds both cases as well as the kivalina case raise political and legal considerations including whether the courts can or should be making climate change policy decisions the outcome of the american electric power case is particularly significant because the issues being considered by the supreme court closely overlap with the main issues presented in the kivalina appeal we are not a party to either of these two lawsuits but are monitoring these developments and their potential industry impacts

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules over a decade ago the epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land the epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the “best available retrofit technology” “bart” for certain older major stationary sources the epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

cholla in 2007 adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq on february 4 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart adeq has reviewed aps’s recommendations and is expected to submit to epa region 9 its proposed bart state implementation plan “sip” for cholla and other sources within the state in the near future on january 19 2011 a group of environmental organizations notified epa of its intent to sue the agency as a result of epa’s alleged failure to promulgate a federal implementation plan for states that have not yet submitted all or part of the required bart sips including arizona 

once aps receives a final determination as to what constitutes bart for cholla we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by adeq however in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities aps is currently implementing portions of its recommended plan for cholla on a voluntary basis costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

four corners and the navajo plant epa region 9 previously requested that aps as the operating agent for four corners and srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant perform a bart analysis for four corners and the navajo plant respectively aps and srp each submitted an analysis to the epa concluding that certain combustion control equipment constitutes bart for these plants based on the analyses and comments received through epa’s rulemaking process the epa will determine what it believes constitutes bart for each plant 

on october 6 2010 the epa issued its proposed bart determination for four corners the proposed rule would require the installation of postcombustion controls on each of units 15 at four corners to reduce nitrogen oxides nox emissions current estimates indicate that aps’s total costs for these controls could be up to approximately 400 million for four corners if aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in units 4 and 5 is consummated and units 13 are closed aps’s total costs for these controls would be approximately 300 million see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities — four corners” for details of this proposed transaction the epa also indicated in the proposal that it may require the installation of electrostatic precipitators or baghouses on units 1 2 and 3 to reduce particulate matter emissions aps estimates that its total costs for such particulate removal equipment is approximately 220 million which may also be required under the anticipated mercury rules see “environmental matters — mercury and other hazardous air pollutants” below for additional information on these anticipated rules the epa proposed a 10 stack opacity limitation for all five units and a 20 opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions although the proposed fugitive dust provision is unrelated to bart 

  18 

on november 24 2010 aps submitted a letter to the epa proposing an alternative to the epa’s october bart proposal specifically aps proposed to close four corners units 1 2 and 3 by 2014 and to install postcombustion pollution controls for nox on units 4 and 5 by the end of 2018 provided that the epa agrees to a contemporaneous resolution of four corners’ obligations or liability if any under the regional haze and reasonably attributable visibility impairment programs the new source review program and nsps programs of the clean air act 

on february 10 2011 the epa signed a supplemental notice requesting comment related to the bart rulemaking for four corners in the supplemental notice the epa proposed to find that a different alternative emission control strategy based upon aps’s november 2010 proposal would achieve more progress than the epa’s october 2010 bart proposal the supplemental notice proposes that units 1 2 and 3 would close by 2014 postcombustion pollution controls for nox would be installed on units 4 and 5 by july 31 2018 and the nox emission limitation for units 4 and 5 would be 0098 lbsmmbtu rather than the 011 lbsmmbtu proposed by the epa in october 2010 the epa extended the comment deadline for both the october 2010 proposal and the supplemental notice to may 2 2011 we are currently evaluating both proposals and will be providing comments to the epa on both 

the epa has not yet issued a proposed rule for the navajo plant srp’s recommended plan for the navajo plant includes the installation of combustion control equipment with an estimated cost to aps of approximately 6 million based on aps’s navajo plant ownership interest if the epa determines that postcombustion controls are required aps’s total costs could be up to approximately 93 million for the navajo plant the four corners and the navajo plant participants will have five years after the epa issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with their respective bart requirements 

in addition on february 16 2010 a group of environmental organizations filed a petition with the departments of interior and agriculture requesting those agencies to certify to the epa that visibility impairment in sixteen national park and wilderness areas is reasonably attributable to emissions from four corners the navajo plant and other nonaps plants if the agencies certify impairment the epa is required to evaluate and if necessary determine bart for four corners and the navajo plant under a different haze program known as “reasonably attributable visibility impairment” on january 19 2011 a similar group of environmental organizations filed a lawsuit against the departments of interior and agriculture alleging among other things that the agencies failed to act on the february 2010 petition “without unreasonable delay” and requesting the court to order the agencies to act on the petition within 30 days we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this lawsuit on aps 

the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with the epa’s final bart determinations coupled with the financial impact of future climate change legislation other environmental regulations the result of the lawsuit mentioned above and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

in order to coordinate with each plant’s other scheduled activities the plants are currently implementing portions of their recommended plans described above on a voluntary basis aps’s share of the costs related to the implementation of these portions of the recommended plans are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

  19 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants in early 2008 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the clean air mercury rule “camr” which was adopted by the epa to regulate mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as a result the law in effect prior to the adoption of the camr became the applicable law and the epa is now required to adopt final maximum achievable control technology emissions “mact” standards under a consent decree that was finalized on april 15 2010 the epa has agreed to issue final mact standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by november 2011 under the terms of the consent decree aps will have three years after the epa issues its final rule to achieve compliance which would likely require aps to install additional pollution control equipment 

aps has installed and continues to install certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards aps estimates that the cost for equipment necessary to meet these anticipated standards is approximately 220 million for four corners units 13 and 89 million for cholla units 13 the estimated costs for four corners units 13 are not included in our current environmental expenditure estimates since our estimates assume the consummation of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 and the subsequent shut down of units 13 cholla’s estimated costs for the next three years are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 for details of our capital expenditure estimates 

coal combustion waste on june 21 2010 the epa released its proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals “ccrs” such as fly ash and bottom ash aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production the epa proposes regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous waste or hazardous waste and requested comments on three different alternatives the hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of ash ponds for disposal of ccrs the other two proposals regulate ccrs as nonhazardous waste and impose performance standards for ash disposal one of these proposals would require retrofitting or closure of currently unlined ash ponds while the other proposal would not require the installation of liners or pond closures the epa has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives 

aps filed comments on the proposed rule during the public comment period which ended on november 19 2010 we do not know when the epa will issue a final rule including required compliance dates we cannot currently predict the outcome of the epa’s actions or whether such actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

ozone national ambient air quality standards in march 2008 the epa adopted new more stringent eighthour ozone standards known as national ambient air quality standards or naaqs in january 2010 the epa proposed to adopt even more stringent eighthour ozone naaqs as ozone standards become more stringent our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds andor to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions at this time aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its operations 

  20 

new source review  on april 6 2009 aps received a request from the epa under section 114 of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners this request is part of an enforcement initiative that the epa has undertaken under the clean air act the epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the new source review provisions of the clean air act other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section 114 requests and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits by the epa aps responded to the epa’s request in august 2009 and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of the epa’s response if any or any resulting actions 

on may 7 2010 aps received a notice of intent to sue from earthjustice on behalf of several environmental organizations related to alleged violations of the clean air act at four corners the “notice” the notice alleges new source reviewrelated violations and nsps violations under the clean air act a citizens group is required to provide 60 days advance notice of its intent to file a lawsuit within that 60day time period the epa may step in and file a lawsuit regarding the allegations if the epa does so the citizens group is precluded from filing its own lawsuit but it may still intervene in the epa’s lawsuit if it so desires the 60day period lapsed in early july 2010 and the epa did not take any action at this time we cannot predict whether or when earthjustice might file a lawsuit 

endangered species act on january 30 2011 the center for biological diversity dine citizens against running our environment and san juan citizens alliance field a lawsuit against the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement “osm” and the department of the interior alleging that osm failed to engage in mandatory endangered species act “esa” consultation with the fish and wildlife service prior to authorizing the renewal of an operating permit for the mine that serves four corners the lawsuit alleges that activities at the mine including mining and the disposal of coal combustion residue will adversely affect several endangered species and their critical habitats the lawsuit requests the court to vacate and remand the mining permit and enjoin all activities carried out under the permit until osm has complied with the esa although we are not a party to the lawsuit we are evaluating the lawsuit to determine its potential impact on plant operations 

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 “ou3” in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with the epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan aps estimates that its costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 1 million which is reserved as a liability on its financial statements we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time we cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures 

by letter dated april 25 2008 the epa informed aps that it may be a prp in the gila river indian reservation superfund site in maricopa county arizona aps along with three other electric utility companies owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a transmission line are located the property abuts the gila river indian community boundary and at one time may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place currently the epa is only seeking payment from aps and four other prps for past cleanuprelated costs involving contamination from the crop dusting based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the epa in its letter to aps we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant sites certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions which in addition to future supply conditions have the potential to impact aps operations 

  22 

san juan river adjudication both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

gila river adjudication a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

little colorado river adjudication aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights a number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’s water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

regulatory risks 

our financial condition depends upon aps’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’s retail electric rates and the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and the ferc arizona like certain other states has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify final orders under certain circumstances the acc must also approve aps’s issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc and the ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes and regulations and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’s business including the ferc the nrc the epa and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’s utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards in addition aps is required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

the operation of aps’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’s cost of operations or impact its business plans 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

  27 

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

regional haze aps is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from the epa that could impose new requirements on four corners and the navajo plant aps is also awaiting a final rulemaking from adeq that could impose new requirements on cholla the epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants depending upon the agencies’ final determinations of what constitutes bart for these plants the financial impact of installing the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of the plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

coal ash the epa released proposed regulations governing the disposal of ccrs which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash the epa proposed regulating ccrs as either nonhazardous or hazardous waste aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products if the epa regulates ccrs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps’s ability to dispose of ccrs through the use of ash ponds aps could incur significant costs for ccr disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 

new source review the epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger new source review requirements under the clean air act the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not result in emissions increases and thus are not subject to new source review in 2009 aps received and responded to a request from the epa regarding projects and operations of four corners a civilian organization notified the four corners participants that it intends to file a citizen suit against the participants for alleged violations of new source review and the nsps program of the clean air act if the epa seeks to impose new source review requirements at four corners or any other aps plant or if the citizen suit is filed and the citizens’ group prevails significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies the epa could also seek civil penalties 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants the epa is required to adopt maximum achievable control technology emissions standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by november 2011 compliance with the new standards will be required three years after the epa issues its final rule depending on the compliance requirements contained in the final rule aps may need to make significant capital investments to install additional pollution control equipment to meet these new standards 

aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’s customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  28 

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions in addition lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases including a lawsuit filed by the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change which was dismissed but has been appealed 

financial risks — potential legislation and regulation  in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions it is possible that some form of legislation may occur in the future at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions 

if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which aps operates ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases any resulting limitations on co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coalfired facilities which constitute approximately 28 of aps’s generation capacity 

at the state level the california legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas emissions and the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a capandtrade program for greenhouse gas this legislation regulation and other statespecific initiatives may affect aps’s business including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants including four corners following expiration of the current lease term in 2016 

in addition the epa has determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act as a result of the endangerment finding the epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources including power plants several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the epa’s endangerment finding aps cannot predict what rules or regulations may ultimately result from the epa’s endangerment finding whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding will be successful or what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps’s operations excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could force aps and other similarlysituated electric power generators to retire or suspend operations at certain coalfired facilities 

physical and operational risks assuming that the primary physical and operational risks to aps from climate change are increased potential for drought or water shortage and a mild to moderate increase in ambient temperatures aps believes it is taking the appropriate steps to respond to these risks weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

  29 

if aps cannot meet or maintain the level of renewable energy required under arizona’s increasing renewable energy standards aps may be subject to penalties or fines for noncompliance 

the res requires aps to supply an increasing percentage of renewable energy each year so that the amount of retail electricity sales from eligible renewable resources is at least 3 of total retail sales by 2011 this amount increases annually to 15 by 2025 in its 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed these standards and committed to an interim renewable energy target of 1700 gwh of renewable resources to be in service by year end 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be 3400 gwh or approximately 10 of retail sales by year end 2015 a portion of this total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increases to 30 of the applicable res requirement in 2012 and subsequent years if aps fails to implement any of its annual accapproved renewable implementation plans it may be subject to penalties imposed by the acc including aps’s inability to recover certain costs compliance with the distributed resource requirement is contingent upon customer participation the development of any renewable generation facilities resulting from the res is subject to many other risks including risks relating to financing permitting technology fuel supply and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’s business and its results of operations 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’s service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’s customers as a result aps cannot predict if when and the extent to which additional competitors may reenter aps’s service territory 

in 2010 the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for nonprofit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution and are therefore not regulated by the acc a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model the use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors “public service corporations” subject to acc regulation and when and the extent to which additional service providers will enter aps’s service territory increasing the level of competition in the market 

  30 

operational risks 

aps’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

weather conditions weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’s results of operations 

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’s communities and electric transmission lines any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’s results of operations 

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demandside management efforts which in turn will impact the demand for electricity the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements to that end the acc passed a policy statement on per customer revenue decoupling in december of 2010 the policy statement will have no effect on aps’s rates unless implemented in a rate case the 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement also establishes energy efficiency goals for aps that begin in 2010 that extend through 2012 subjecting aps to energy efficiency requirements slightly greater for those years than required under the rules described above 

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 25 of the overall res requirement of 3 in 2011 and increases to 30 of the applicable res requirement in 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs 

reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless offset through ratemaking mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power outages or reduced output which could materially affect aps’s results of operations  

the operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’s business if aps’s facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  31 

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’s business and results of operations 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’s generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

certain aps power plants including four corners and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is currently unable to predict the final outcome of discussions with the appropriate indian tribes and approval by their respective governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases easements and rightsofway 

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 118 million but not more than 18 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

the operation of palo verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed andor extended in december 2008 aps applied for renewed operating licenses for all three palo verde units for 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses aps does not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses however as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict 

  32 

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

aps’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” which was signed into law in july 2010 contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the overthe counter or otc derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation the doddfrank act could restrict among other things trading positions in the energy futures markets require different collateral or settlement positions or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions based on the provisions included in the doddfrank act and the implementation of regulations yet to be developed these changes could among other things impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of aps’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

changes in technology could create challenges for aps’s existing business 

research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption including clean coal and coal gasification renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells customersited generation solar and efficiency technologies and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’s existing generating facilities less economical in addition advances in technology could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’s business 

aps is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies digital meters enabling twoway communications between the utility and its customers and electric usage monitoring devices for customers’ homes and businesses many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested and their use on largescale systems is not as advanced and established as aps’s existing technologies and equipment uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect aps’s business if national standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to perform as expected in addition widespread installation and acceptance of these devices could enable the entry of new market participants such as technology companies into the interface between aps and its customers 

  33 

we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

like most companies in the electric utility industry our workforce is aging and a number of our employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees we may not be successful we are subject to other employee workforce factors such as the availability of qualified personnel the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages exposure to these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to information security risks 

in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security and customer information we are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information including confidential customer information or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

financial risks 

financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit and capital markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

we rely on access to shortterm money markets longerterm capital markets and the bank market as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets such disruptions could include 

 

 

 

 

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting our lenders which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

  34 

changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

 

 

 

 

a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our current ratings are set forth in “liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’s securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could completely eliminate any possible future access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

market performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding that could negatively impact our business 

disruptions in the capital markets andor decline in market value may adversely affect the values of fixed income and equity investments held in our employee benefit plan trusts and nuclear decommissioning trusts we have significant obligations in these areas and hold substantial assets in these trusts a decline in the market value of the investments in these trusts may increase our funding requirements additionally the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are impacted by the discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates impact the discount rate and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans a significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices our inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner or any increased funding obligations could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  35 

we may be required to adopt ifrs the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board “iasb” that is being considered by the sec to replace accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” for use in preparation of financial statements if the sec requires mandatory adoption of ifrs we may lose our ability to use regulatory accounting treatment and would follow ifrs rather than gaap for the preparation of our financial statements beginning in 2014 in the meantime the fasb and the iasb are working on several accounting standards jointly to converge certain accounting differences before 2014 the implementation and adoption of these new standards and the inability to use regulatory accounting could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

our cash flow largely depends on the performance of aps 

we conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiary aps substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by aps accordingly our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 

aps’s debt agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us in addition an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

pinnacle west’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 

because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

 

 

  36 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

 

 

 

 

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

suncor’s continuing winddown of its real estate business may give rise to various claims 

since 2009 suncor has been engaged in a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt as of december 31 2010 suncor had no existing bank debt and had total assets remaining on its books of 16 million consisting of 8 million of intercompany receivables 3 million of assets held for sale and 5 million of other assets suncor is focusing on concluding an orderly winddown of its business this effort includes addressing contingent liabilities such as warranty and construction claims that may be brought by property owners and potential funding obligations to local taxing districts that financed infrastructure at certain of its real estate developments 

pinnacle west has not guaranteed any of suncor’s obligations suncor’s remaining business operations and its ability to generate cash from operations are minimal as a result suncor may seek judicial protection to effectuate a resolution of any claims that cannot be successfully addressed by other means in such event pinnacle west could be exposed to the uncertainties and complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings 

  37 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2010 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

see “business of arizona public service company” in item 1 for a map detailing the location of aps’s major power plants and principal transmission lines 

transmission and distribution facilities 

current facilities  aps’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 5992 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5769 miles of which are located in arizona aps’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11098 miles of overhead lines and approximately 17417 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’s jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 

 

expansion each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’s 2011 plan aps projects it will invest approximately 450 million in new transmission over the next ten years which includes 258 miles of new lines this investment will increase the import capability into metropolitan phoenix by approximately 6 and will increase the import capability into the yuma area by approximately 39 one significant project presently nearing completion is the morgan — pinnacle peak project which consists of 26 miles of 500kv and 230kv lines 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’s 2011 transmission plan are the delany to palo verde line and the north gila to palo verde line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california

plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands 

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under easements from the federal government the easement and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for four corners expire in 2016 each of the leases contains an option to extend for an additional 25year period from the end of the existing lease term for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index the easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or extension of the easements may be imposed aps is currently working with the navajo nation to extend the four corners leases and the transmission rightsofway discussed below for an additional twentyfive years see “business of arizona public service company — energy sources and resource planning — generation facilities — coal fueled generating facilities” in item 1 for details of this extension and the related required approvals the ultimate cost of renewal of the navajo plant and four corners leases and easements is uncertain the coal contracted for use in these plants is also located on indian reservations 

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation the four corners and navajo plant leases provide navajo nation consent to certain of the rightsofway for transmission lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the rightsofway and for a like payment in any renewal period in addition a 1985 amendment to the leases provides a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rightsofway however some of our rightsofway are not covered by the leases or are granted by other indian tribes in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rightsofway certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway or that are typical for similar permits across nonindian lands however we are unaware of the underlying agreements andor specific circumstances surrounding these renewals the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is uncertain we are monitoring these rightsofway and easement issues and have had extensive discussions with the navajo nation regarding them we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

overview 

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps accounts for substantially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

areas of business focus 

operational performance reliability and recent developments 

nuclear in 2010 palo verde achieved its best generation year ever producing over 31 million megawatthours with an overall station capacity factor of 905 the generation from each palo verde operating unit directly reflects the station’s currently effective 18month refueling cycle in 2010 palo verde successfully refueled both unit 1 and unit 3 as part of the 2010 refueling outages palo verde installed new reactor vessel closure heads and simplified head assembly modifications these projects are designed to provide safety benefits eliminate costly inspections and reduce the duration of future outages 

coal and related environmental matters apsoperated coal plants four corners and cholla achieved net capacity factors of 82 and 79 respectively in 2010 aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from potential legislation and increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions recent concern over climate change and other emissionrelated issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants aps is closely monitoring its long range capital management plans understanding that any resulting legislation and regulation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades in particular on october 6 2010 the epa issued its proposed determination for “best available retrofit technology” bart requirements for four corners that as proposed would require installation of additional pollution control equipment on all five of the plant’s units based on aps’s current ownership share of four corners aps currently estimates that its total costs for the proposed controls could be up to approximately 400 million for nitrogen oxide controls and about 220 million for particulate removal equipment it is currently evaluating the impacts of the proposed determination and intends to submit comments during the epa’s comment period see “business of arizona public service company — environmental matters” in item 1 and environmental and climate changerelated risks described in item 1a for additional environmental and climate change developments and risks facing aps 

  48 

in addition sce a participant in four corners has indicated that certain california legislation may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant on november 8 2010 aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce’s 48 interest in each of units 4 and 5 of four corners the purchase price is 294 million subject to certain adjustments completion of the purchase by aps which is expected to occur in the second half of 2012 is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc the california public utilities commission and the ferc aps and sce filed applications with their respective commissions seeking requisite authority or approvals to complete the transaction closing is also conditioned on the execution of a new coal supply contract for the lease renewal period described below expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act and other typical closing conditions 

aps on behalf of the four corners participants has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which would extend the four corners leasehold interest to 2041 execution by the navajo nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by aps of sce’s interests in four corners the execution of these amendments by the navajo nation requires the approval of the navajo nation council which occurred on february 15 2011 and is awaiting final signature by the nation’s president the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi as does a related federal rightsofway grant which the four corners participants will pursue a federal environmental review will be conducted as part of the doi review process 

pursuant to a cotenancy agreement among the four corners participants the other participants have a right of first refusal to purchase shares of sce’s interests proportional to their current ownership percentages the exercise of this purchase right by any of the other participants must be exercised by march 8 2011 if any of the purchase rights are exercised the amount available for purchase by aps would be reduced at this time aps does not know whether any of the other participants will exercise the right of first refusal 

aps has announced that if aps’s purchase of sce’s interests in units 4 and 5 at four corners is consummated it will close units 1 2 and 3 at the plant these events will change the plant’s overall generating capacity from 2100 mw to 1540 mw and aps’s entitlement from the plant from 791 mw to 970 mw when applying for approval to purchase units 4 and 5 aps also requested from the acc recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of units 1 2 and 3 

transmission and delivery in the area of transmission and delivery to its customers aps ranked favorably during 2010 with top quartile performance for average customer outage time and its best reliability year to date during 2010 aps undertook several significant transmission projects including the morgan to pinnacle peak transmission line scheduled for completion in 2011 aps’s 2011 transmission plan projects that it will invest approximately 450 million in new transmission over the next ten years which includes 258 miles of new lines the first three years of these additions are included in the capital expenditures table presented in the “liquidity” section below along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology throughout its service territory designed to provide longterm benefits both to aps and its customers aps is piloting and deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations and the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

  49 

renewable energy  the acc approved the res in 2006 recognizing the importance of renewable energy to our state the renewable energy requirement is 3 of retail electric sales in 2011 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in the 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to 1700 gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by yearend 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments taken together aps’s commitment is estimated to be 3400 gwh or approximately 10 of aps’s retail energy sales by yearend 2015 which is double the existing res target of 5 for that year see note 3 a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties 

aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 875 mw including solar wind geothermal biomass and biogas of this portfolio 288 mw are currently in operation and 587 mw are under contract for development or are under construction renewable resources in operation include 5 mw of utilityscale facilities owned by aps 223 mw of longterm purchased power agreements and an estimated 60 mw of customersited thirdparty owned distributed energy resources 

to achieve our res requirements as mentioned above to date aps has entered into contracts for 587 mw of renewable resources that are planned in development or under construction aps’s strategy to procure these resources includes new facilities to be owned by aps purchased power contracts for new facilities and ongoing development of distributed energy resources through the az sun program approved by the acc on march 3 2010 aps plans to own 100 mw of solar photovoltaic power plants across arizona by investing up to 500 million through 2014 under this program aps has executed contracts for the development of 83 mw of new solar generation representing an investment commitment of approximately 377 million see note 3 for additional details of the az sun program including the related cost recovery aps has also entered into longterm purchased power agreements for 382 mw from solar wind and biogas facilities currently planned in development or under construction and 122 mw from distributed energy resources agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid 

aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio both to ensure its compliance with the renewable energy standard and to meet the needs of its customer base  

demand side management arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 the 22 figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives on july 27 2010 the proposed energy efficiency standard was adopted by the acc approved by the arizona attorney general and became effective on january 1 2011 this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs 

  50 

rate matters aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health aps’s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc at the end of 2009 the acc approved a settlement agreement entered into by aps and twentyone of the twentythree other parties to aps’s general retail rate case with modifications that did not materially affect the overall economic terms of the agreement the rate case settlement authorizes and requires equity infusions into aps of at least 700 million prior to the end of 2014 the settlement demonstrated cooperation among aps the acc staff the residential utility consumer office ruco and other intervenors to the rate case and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows aps the opportunity to help shape arizona’s energy future outside of continual rate cases see note 3 for a detailed discussion of the settlement agreement terms and information on aps’s ferc rates 

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demandside management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

on october 18 2010 the chairman of the acc issued a draft decoupling policy statement for consideration by the commission on december 15 2010 the acc unanimously approved a slightly modified decoupling policy statement supportive of using a revenuepercustomer methodology which is the mechanism aps and a number of other parties support decoupling refers to a ratemaking design which reduces or removes the linkage between sales and utility revenues andor profits reducing utility disincentives to the adoption of programs that benefit customers by saving energy mechanically decoupling compares actual versus authorized revenues or revenue per customer over a period and either credits or collects any differences from customers in a subsequent period the policy permits regulated utilities to file a decoupling proposal in their next general rate case aps intends to include a decoupling model consistent with the policy statement for consideration in its upcoming general rate case currently expected to be filed in june 2011 

financial strength and flexibility pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company in early february 2010 aps entered into a 500 million revolving credit facility replacing its 377 million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in december 2010 at that same time pinnacle west entered into a 200 million revolving credit facility that replaced its 283 million facility that also would have otherwise terminated in december 2010 since march 2010 pinnacle west and aps have accessed the commercial paper market which neither company had utilized since the third quarter of 2008 due to negative market conditions 

in april 2010 pinnacle west issued 6900000 shares of common stock at an offering price of 3800 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately 253 million pinnacle west contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering into aps in the form of equity infusions aps has used these capital contributions to repay shortterm indebtedness to finance capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 

in early february 2011 aps entered into a 500 million revolving credit facility replacing its 489 million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in september 2011 

suncor real estate operations as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets during 2009 suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt at december 31 2010 suncor had total remaining assets of about 16 million which includes approximately 3 million of assets held for sale see “liquidity and capital resources — other subsidiaries — suncor” below for information regarding 2010 asset sales and liquidity matters 

  51 

district cooling business sale  on june 22 2010 apses sold its district cooling business consisting of operations in downtown phoenix tucson and on certain arizona state university campuses the sale resulted in an aftertax gain of approximately 25 million apses is now focused on its core business of energy conservation and renewable energy contracting services 

subsidiaries the operations of apses and our other first tier subsidiary el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years 

key financial drivers 

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

electric operating revenues for the years 2008 through 2010 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps’s retail customers through the psa these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

customer and sales growth customer growth in aps’s service territory for the year ended december 31 2010 was 06 compared with the prior year for the three years 2008 through 2010 aps’s customer growth averaged 09 per year we currently expect customer growth to average about 17 per year for 2011 through 2013 due to anticipated improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona retail sales in kilowatthours adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations for 2010 declined 10 compared to the prior year reflecting the poor economic conditions in 2010 and the effects of our energy efficiency programs for the three years 2008 through 2010 aps’s actual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations declined at an average annual rate of 09 we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will remain flat on average per year during 2011 through 2013 including the effects of aps’s energy efficiency programs but excluding the effects of weather variations a continuation of the economic downturn or the failure of the arizona economy to rebound in the near future could further impact these estimates the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns impacts of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

weather in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  52 

fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues and other factors in its 2009 retail rate case settlement aps committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through 2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases to be incurred in 2011 and 2012 

depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities we have also applied to the nrc for renewed operating licenses for each of the palo verde units if the nrc grants the extension we estimate that our annual pretax depreciation expense will decrease by approximately 34 million at the later of the license extension date or january 1 2012 

property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 80 of the assessed value in 2010 75 of the assessed value in 2009 and 78 of the assessed value in 2008 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plants including new generation transmission and distribution facilities described below under “capital additions” and as we improve our existing facilities 

income taxes  income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates and certain nontaxable items such as the afudc in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities equity issuances and internally generated cash flow an allowance for borrowed funds offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation

results of operations 

pinnacle west’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electricity service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution 

our reportable business segments reflect a change from previously reported information as of december 31 2010 our real estate activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate reporting or disclosure in 2009 our real estate subsidiary suncor began disposing of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt see note 23 at december 31 2010 suncor had total remaining assets of about 16 million which includes approximately 3 million of assets held for sale additionally all of suncor’s operations are reflected in discontinued operations 

operating results — 2010 compared with 2009 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2010 was 350 million compared with 68 million for the comparable prioryear period the improved results were primarily due to lower real estate impairment charges recorded in 2010 compared with the prioryear period by suncor 

  54 

in addition regulated electricity segment net income increased approximately 82 million from the prioryear period due to increased revenues related to aps’s retail rate increases and other factors our consolidated results for 2010 also include a gain of 25 million after income taxes related to the sale of apses’ district cooling business the following table presents net income loss attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prioryear period

regulated electricity segment 

this section includes a discussion of major variances in income and expense amounts for the regulated electricity segment 

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 164 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year the following table describes the major components of this change 

 

operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased 48 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

 

 

  56 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were 8 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of increased plant in service partially offset by lower depreciation rates 

taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased 12 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the current year 

interest charges net of allowance for funds used during construction interest charges net of allowance for funds used during construction decreased 8 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher rates in the current year for the allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction partially offset by higher interest charges due to higher debt balances interest charges net of allowance for funds used during construction are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the line items interest expense and allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction from the consolidated statements of income 

income taxes income taxes were 19 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher pretax income in the currentyear period partially offset by 17 million of income tax benefits related to prior years that were resolved in the current year see note 4 

all other 

all other revenues increased 56 million partially offset by increased other expenses of 41 million resulting primarily from improved margins from apses’ products and services business in addition other income was higher due to investment losses at el dorado in 2009 

discontinued operations 

real estate activities during the first quarter of 2009 suncor’s board of directors authorized a series of strategic transactions to dispose of suncor’s assets this decision resulted in impairment charges of approximately 161 million after income taxes in 2009 as of december 31 2010 all of suncor’s operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations see note 22 the aftertax impacts of the 6 million loss from real estate activities for the year ended 2010 includes real estate impairment charges of approximately 10 million see note 23 and other costs of 6 million partially offset by a gain from debt restructuring of approximately 10 million see note 6 

all other all other earnings from discontinued operations were 24 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared to the prioryear period primarily because of a gain of 25 million after income taxes related to the sale of apses’ district cooling business in 2010 

operating results — 2009 compared with 2008 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2009 was 68 million compared with 242 million for the prior year period the decrease in net income was primarily due to 2009 real estate impairment charges recorded by suncor the company’s real estate subsidiary 

  57 

in addition regulated electricity segment net income decreased approximately 13 million from the prior year primarily due to lower retail sales resulting from lower usage per customer higher interest charges net of capitalized financing costs higher depreciation and amortization expenses and the absence of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008 these negative factors were partially offset by increased revenues due to an interim rate increase effective january 1 2009 and transmission rate increases

cash flows — pinnacle west consolidated 

the following table presents net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 dollars in millions 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

the decrease of approximately 317 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to voluntary pension contributions in 2010 of approximately 200 million changes in collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices and other changes in working capital 

the decrease of approximately 129 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to approximately 100 million of proceeds from the sale of the district cooling business in june 2010 and the increase in proceeds from the sale of commercial real estate investments of approximately 29 million 

the decrease of approximately 113 million in net cash used for financing activities is primarily due to lower repayments of shortterm borrowings in 2010 due to lower shortterm debt balances partially offset by lower net sources of equity and longterm debt financing including the proceeds of approximately 253 million from the issuance of equity in april 2010 and aps’s issuance of 500 million of unsecured senior notes in 2009 

2009 compared with 2008

liquidity 

capital expenditure requirements 

the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for 2008 2009 and 2010 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 

capital expenditures dollars in millions 

 

 generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’s existing fossil and nuclear plants examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment included under renewables is the az sun program which is a significant component of the increase in capital expenditures from 2010 to 2011 for purposes of this table we have assumed the consummation of aps’s purchase of sce’s interest in four corners units 4 and 5 and the subsequent shut down of units 13 as discussed in the “overview” section above as a result we included the 294 million purchase price under generation and have not included environmental expenditures for units 13 we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters which depending on their final outcome could require modification to our environmental expenditures see “business of arizona public service company — environmental matters — epa environmental regulation — regional haze rules mercury and other hazardous air pollutants and coal combustion waste” in item 1 

distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction related information systems and facility costs examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems 

capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  63 

pinnacle west parent company 

our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our shortterm and longterm debt the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

on january 19 2011 the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0525 per share of common stock payable on march 1 2011 to shareholders of record on february 1 2011 

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external debt and equity financings for the years 2008 through 2010 total distributions from aps were 522 million and there were no distributions from suncor for 2010 cash distributions from aps were 182 million 

an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2010 aps’s common equity ratio as defined was 53 its total shareholder equity was approximately 38 billion and total capitalization was approximately 72 billion aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if the payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 29 billion assuming aps’s total capitalization remains the same based on the discussion above this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west’s ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements 

pinnacle west and aps maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for the commercial paper programs during the first quarter of 2010 pinnacle west and aps refinanced existing credit facilities that would have otherwise matured in december 2010 

on february 12 2010 pinnacle west refinanced its 283 million revolving credit facility that would have matured in december 2010 and decreased the size of the facility to 200 million the new facility matures in february 2013 pinnacle west has the option to increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of 300 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders pinnacle west will use the facility for general corporate purposes commercial paper program support and for the issuance of letters of credit interest rates are based on pinnacle west’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings as a result of the downsized credit facility the company also reduced the size of its commercial paper program to 200 million from 250 million 

at december 31 2010 the 200 million credit facility was available to support the issuance of up to 183 million in commercial paper or for bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit up to 183 million at december 31 2010 pinnacle west had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 17 million of commercial paper borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit 

  64 

in april 2010 pinnacle west issued 6900000 shares of common stock at an offering price of 3800 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately 253 million pinnacle west contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering into aps in the form of equity infusions aps has used these contributions to repay shortterm indebtedness to finance capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes pinnacle west intends to issue equity to provide most of the funds for the equity infusions into aps required by the retail rate case settlement such equity issuances may occur at any time in the period through 2014 at pinnacle west’s discretion see note 3 

in june 2010 pinnacle west received approximately 100 million related to the sale of apses’ district cooling business the net proceeds were used to repay shortterm indebtedness 

pinnacle west expects to receive approximately 132 million of cash tax benefits related to suncor’s strategic asset sales see note 23 a majority of which have been realized as of december 31 2010 approximately 7 million of these benefits were recorded in 2010 as reductions to income tax expense related to the current impairment charges the additional 125 million of tax benefits were recorded as reductions to income tax expense related to suncor impairment charges recorded on or before december 31 2009 

the 68 million income tax receivables on the consolidated balance sheets represent the anticipated refunds related to an aps tax accounting method change approved by the irs in the third quarter of 2009 and the current year tax benefits related to the suncor strategic asset sales that closed in 2010 

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 includes provisions making qualified property placed into service after september 8 2010 and before january 1 2012 eligible for 100 bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes in addition qualified property placed into service in 2012 is eligible for 50 bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes these provisions of the recent tax legislation are expected to generate approximately 450500 million of cash tax benefits for aps through accelerated depreciation it is anticipated that these cash benefits will be fully realized by aps by the end of 2013 with a majority of the benefit realized in 2012 and 2013 the cash generated is an acceleration of tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over 20 years 

pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries irs regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation the assets in the plan are comprised of fixedincome equity real estate and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions during 2010 we made voluntary contributions of 200 million to our pension plan the required minimum contribution to our pension plan is zero in 2011 and approximately 85 million in 2012 the contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2010 was approximately 17 million the contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans for 2011 and 2012 are expected to be approximately 20 million each year aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions aps’s share is approximately 98 of both plans

aps 

aps’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of longterm debt aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 

on february 12 2010 aps refinanced its 377 million credit facility that would have matured in december 2010 and increased the size of the facility to 500 million the new credit facility terminates in february 2013 aps may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of 700 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders aps will use the facility for general corporate purposes commercial paper program support and for the issuance of letters of credit interest rates are based on aps’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings

el dorado — el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 

apses —apses expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 

debt provisions 

pinnacle west’s and aps’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant and each anticipates it will continue to meet this and other significant covenant requirements for both pinnacle west and aps this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2010 the ratio was approximately 49 for pinnacle west and 46 for aps failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  67 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’s bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facilities borrowings 

see notes 5 and 6 for further discussions of liquidity matters 

credit ratings 

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 17 2011 are shown below the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’s securities andor result in an increase in the cost of or limit access to capital such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments insurance policies natural gas transportation fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts at this time we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover a downward revision to our credit ratings 

 

   68 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on january 1 2010 we adopted amended accounting guidance relating to vies and as a result we have consolidated certain entities which were previously not consolidated the consolidation of these entities has impacted our consolidated financial statements see notes 1 2 and 20 for a discussion of these impacts 

guarantees and surety bonds 

we have issued parental guarantees and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries including credit support instruments enabling apses to offer energyrelated products and surety bonds at aps principally related to selfinsured workers’ compensation nonperformance or nonpayment under the underlying contract by our subsidiaries would result in a payment liability on our part under the guarantee or surety bond no liability is currently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to such instruments at december 31 2010 we had no outstanding claims for payment under any of these instruments our guarantees and surety bonds have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under these instruments or surety bonds from our subsidiaries we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2010 dollars in millions 

 

 this table excludes 133 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain this table also excludes 85 million in estimated minimum pension contributions in 2012 see note 8 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

  70 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 10 billion of regulatory assets and 753 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2010 is a regulatory asset of 669 million for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  71 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2010 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2010 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2010 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2010 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  72 

derivative accounting 

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is recognized in current earnings 

see “market risks — commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see “fair value measurements” below for additional information on valuation see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting 

fair value measurements 

we apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments nuclear decommissioning trusts certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting 

our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities the fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets see note 14 for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts 

real estate investment impairments 

while we do not have any real estate investments or home inventory at december 31 2010 we did have real estate investments of 120 million and 3 million of home inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 for purposes of evaluating impairment in accordance with guidance on the impairment and disposal of longlived assets we classified our real estate assets such as land under development land held for future development and commercial property as “held and used” when events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used were not recoverable we compared the undiscounted cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeded the undiscounted cash flows we adjusted the asset to fair value and recognized an impairment charge the adjusted value became the new book value carrying amount for held and used assets we may have had real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that were lower than their carrying amounts but were not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts 

  73 

real estate home inventory was considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating impairment home inventories were reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell fair value less cost to sell was evaluated each period to determine if it had changed losses and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized were reported as adjustments to the carrying amount 

we determined fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset discounted for market risk our impairment assessments and fair value determinations required significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices future construction and land development costs future sales timing and discount rates the assumptions were specific to each project and may have varied among projects the discount rates we used to determine fair values at december 31 2009 ranged from 11 to 29 due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process with regard to impairments it is possible that actual results could have differed from those estimates 

other accounting matters 

on january 1 2010 we adopted amended accounting guidance relating to vies and as a result we have consolidated certain entities which were previously not consolidated the consolidation of these entities has impacted our consolidated financial statements see notes 1 2 and 20 for a discussion of these impacts 

the fasb is currently working on several significant projects with the desire to converge gaap with ifrs these projects include accounting for leases revenue recognition and financial instruments among other items concurrently the sec is considering mandating ifrs for us companies see note 2 for a discussion of these potential changes 

market and credit risks 

market risks 

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 

interest rate and equity risk

 item 1 business 

pinnacle west 

pinnacle west is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries we derive the majority of our revenues and earnings from our whollyowned subsidiary aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 

operating revenues in thousands  

 

pinnacle west’s other firsttier subsidiaries are suncor apses and el dorado additional information related to these businesses is provided later in this report 

our reportable business segments are the regulated electricity segment which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation transmission and distribution and the real estate segment which consists of real estate development and investment activities in the western united states 

due to the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets in 2009 our realestate subsidiary suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt as a part of this plan to sell substantially all of suncor’s assets the real estate segment may no longer be a reporting segment in the future see note 17 for financial information of our business segments 

business of arizona public service company 

aps currently provides electric service to approximately 11 million customers we own or lease more than 6280 mw of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both longterm and shortterm power purchase agreements for additional capacity including a variety of agreements for the purchase of renewable energy during 2009 no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 11 of our electric revenues 

  3 

the following map shows aps’ retail service territory including the locations of its generating facilities and principal transmission lines 

energy sources and resource planning 

to serve its customers aps obtains power through its various generation stations and through power purchase agreements resource planning is an important function necessary to meet arizona’s future energy needs aps’ sources of energy by fuel type during 2009 were coal — 363 nuclear — 259 purchased power — 206 and gas oil and other — 172 

generation facilities 

aps has ownership interests in or leases the coal nuclear gas oil and solar generating facilities described below for additional information regarding these facilities see item 2 

coal fueled generating facilities 

four corners — four corners is a 5unit coalfired power plant located in the northwestern corner of new mexico aps operates the plant and owns 100 of four corners units 1 2 and 3 and 15 of units 4 and 5 aps has a total entitlement from four corners of 785 mw the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government see “plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands” in item 2 for additional information aps purchases all of four corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a longterm lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation the four corners coal contract runs through 2016 

  4 

cholla — cholla is a 4unit coalfired power plant located in northeastern arizona aps operates the plant and owns 100 of cholla units 1 2 and 3 pacificorp owns cholla unit 4 and aps operates that unit for pacificorp aps has a total entitlement from cholla of 647 mw aps purchases all of cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the federal government and private landholders the cholla coal contract runs through 2024 aps has the ability under the contract to reduce its annual coal commitment and purchase a portion of cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options and to purchase coal required for increased operating capacity aps believes that the current fuel contracts and competitive fuel supply options ensure the continued operation of cholla for its useful life in addition aps has a longterm coal transportation contract 

navajo generating station — the navajo plant is a 3unit coalfired power plant located in northern arizona salt river project operates the plant and aps owns a 14 interest in navajo units 1 2 and 3 aps has a total entitlement from the navajo plant of 315 mw the navajo plant’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2011 with options to extend through 2019 the navajo plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government see “plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands” in item 2 for additional information 

these coal plants face uncertainties related to existing and potential legislation and regulation that could significantly impact their economics and operations see “environmental matters” below and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 for environmental and climate change developments impacting these coal facilities see note 11 for information regarding aps’ coal mine reclamation obligations 

nuclear 

palo verde nuclear generating station — palo verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and about 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases about 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined interest in that unit aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of 1146 mw 

palo verde leases — in 1986 aps sold about 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions aps accounts for these leases as operating leases the leases which have terms of 295 years contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms aps must give notice to the respective lessors between december 31 2010 and december 31 2012 if it wishes to exercise or not exercise either of these options we are analyzing these options see notes 9 and 20 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  5 

palo verde operating licenses — operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 the full power operating licenses each valid for a period of 40 years authorize aps as operating agent for palo verde to operate the three palo verde units at full power on december 15 2008 aps applied for renewed operating licenses for the palo verde units for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses the current nrc schedule for the applications estimates a final decision in the fall of 2011 aps is making preparations to secure resources necessary to operate the plant for the period of extended operation 

palo verde fuel cycle — the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2011 new contracts are currently being negotiated that would meet the plant’s conversion services needs through 2011 taking into account available inventory the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2013 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services until at least 2015 

spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal — palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite independent spent fuel storage installation “isfsi” to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period through 2027 additionally palo verde has sufficient capacity at its onsite isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation if uncertainties regarding the united states government’s obligation to accept and store used fuel are not favorably resolved aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation see “palo verde nuclear generating station” in note 11 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal 

nrc inspection — on february 22 2007 the nrc issued a “white” finding low to moderate safety significance due to electrical output issues with the unit 3 emergency diesel generator that occurred in 2006 under the nrc’s action matrix this finding coupled with a previous nrc “yellow” finding relating to a 2004 matter involving palo verde’s safety injection systems resulted in palo verde unit 3 being placed in the “multiplerepetitive degraded cornerstone” column of the nrc’s action matrix “column 4” subjecting it to an enhanced nrc inspection regime although only palo verde unit 3 was in nrc’s column 4 in order to adequately assess the need for improvements aps’ management conducted sitewide assessments of equipment and operations 

on march 24 2009 the nrc informed aps that it was removing palo verde unit 3 from column 4 removing units 1 and 2 from the “one degraded cornerstone” column “column 3” of the nrc’s action matrix and returning all three units of the plant to “column 1” routine inspection and oversight by the nrc this notification followed the nrc’s completion of its inspections of the corrective actions taken by palo verde to address the performance deficiencies that caused the nrc to place unit 3 into column 4 and units 1 and 2 into column 3 

  6 

nuclear decommissioning costs — aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’ acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism see note 12 for additional information about aps’ nuclear decommissioning costs 

palo verde liability and insurance matters — see “palo verde nuclear generating station — nuclear insurance” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities 

aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona consisting of redhawk located near the palo verde nuclear generating station ocotillo located in tempe sundance located in coolidge west phoenix located in southwest phoenix saguaro located north of tucson and yucca located near yuma several of the units at saguaro and yucca run on either gas or oil aps has one oil power plant douglas located in the town of douglas arizona aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one combustion turbine unit and one steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district aps has a total entitlement from these plants of 3389 mw gas for these plants is acquired through aps’ hedging program aps has longterm gas transportation agreements with three different companies which provide aps with fuel delivery through 2024 fuel oil is acquired under shortterm purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix where it is distributed to aps’ other oil power plants by truck 

solar facilities 

aps owns and operates more than thirty ongrid and offgrid small solar systems around the state together they have the capacity to produce about 6 mw of renewable energy this fleet of solar systems is anchored by a 3 mw facility located at the prescott airport and a 1 mw facility located at aps’ saguaro power plant 

purchased power contracts 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements including longterm contracts and purchases through shortterm markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements a substantial portion of aps’ purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income see note 18 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability aps does not expect to require new conventional generation sources sooner than 2017 due to planned additions of renewable resources and energy efficiency initiatives 

purchased power capacity — aps’ purchased power capacity under longterm contracts including its renewable energy portfolio is summarized in the tables below all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted

current and future resources 

current demand and reserve margin 

electric power demand is generally seasonal in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months aps’ 2009 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 27 2009 at 7218 mw compared to the 2008 peak of 7026 mw recorded on august 1 2008 aps’ operable generating capacity together with firm purchases totaling 2657 mw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases resulted in an actual reserve margin at the time of the 2009 peak demand of 156 the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages and technical problems 

future resources and resource plan 

on january 29 2009 aps submitted a resource plan report to the acc proposing a diverse portfolio of generation resources to address the projected 60 increase in customer peak demand by 2025 which equates to approximately 6500 mw of new capacity resources and accounts for both new resources needed to meet growing customer loads as well as resources that will be needed to replace expiring longterm purchases 

on december 15 2009 the acc approved a modified resource planning rule that requires aps to file by april 1 st of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteenyear period the acc’s modified rule also requires aps to file its first resource plan within 120 days after the rule becomes effective aps believes the modified rule will likely become effective by mid2010 requiring aps to file a revised resource plan by the fall of 2010 which will supercede the january 2009 filing the modified rule also requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps’ resource plan within approximately nine months following its submittal 

  9 

renewable energy standard 

in connection with its ongoing resource planning efforts aps continues to focus on increasing the percentage of its energy that is produced by renewable resources in 2006 the acc adopted the arizona renewable energy standard and tariff the “renewable energy standard” or “res” under the renewable energy standard electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement is 25 of retail electric sales in 2010 and increases annually until it reaches 15 in 2025 in aps’ recent retail rate case settlement agreement aps committed to among other things an interim renewable energy target of 10 by yearend 2015 which is double the existing res target of 5 for that year see note 3 a component of the original res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties accordingly under the original res an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources this distributed energy requirement is 20 of the overall res requirement of 25 in 2010 and increases to 30 of the applicable res requirement in 2012 and subsequent years the following table summarizes these requirement standards and their timing 

 

aps has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar and biomass which currently collectively generates over 210 mw of renewable energy for its customers via owned or contracted renewable generation facilities and an additional installed capacity of 21 mw equivalent of customersited distribution energy systems in operation these current renewable generation projects are either apsowned solar facilities as described under “generation facilities — solar facilities” above are acquired through longterm purchased power agreements as described under “purchased power contracts” above or are partially funded by renewable incentives we offer to our customers aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio both to ensure its compliance with the renewable energy standard and to meet the needs of its customer base 

demand side management and energy efficiency 

arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy in december 2009 the acc initiated energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of 22 annual energy savings by 2020 an ambitious standard such as that proposed will likely increase participation by aps customers in these conservation and energy efficiency programs which in turn will likely impact arizona’s future energy resource needs energy efficiency rules are expected to be formally adopted in 2010 see note 3 for demand side management and energy efficiency obligations resulting from aps’ recent retail rate case settlement 

economic stimulus projects 

through the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” the federal government is making a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources improve reliability and create jobs from the availability of economic stimulus funding certain programs are also available through the state of arizona 

in 2009 the doe announced an arra commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide emission reduction research and development project in the amount of 705 million which will be located at our cholla power plant it also announced a commitment to fund subject to final negotiations a 33 million high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to a proposed aps community power project in flagstaff arizona these funding amounts are contingent upon meeting certain project milestones including doeestablished budget parameters over the next four years 

  10 

aps has also been selected by the state of arizona’s department of commerce as a subrecipient under the state’s arra award for the implementation of various distributed energy and energy efficiency programs in arizona the state is in final negotiations to provide aps with approximately 37 million from the state’s arra grant so that aps can implement certain solar water heater photovoltaic andor wind energy related community projects 

aps intends to continue to evaluate additional funding opportunities under the arra programs that may be of benefit to aps’ business operations or community activities 

competitive environment and regulatory oversight 

retail 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer or encumbrance of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’ retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers in 2000 an arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision 

to date the acc has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision however as a result of a new request for authorization to provide competitive retail electric service by sempra energy solutions llc the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation is due to be filed with the acc on april 1 2010 at present only limited electric retail competition exists in arizona and only with certain entities not regulated by the acc 

currently there are two matters pending with the acc that involve a business model where customers pay solar vendors for the installation and operation of solar facilities based on the amount of energy produced the acc must make a determination whether these entities would be considered “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution causing them to be regulated by the acc use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition however at this time we do not feel this would materially impact our financial results aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will enter or reenter aps’ service territory 

  11 

wholesale 

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see note 3 for information regarding aps’ transmission rates during 2009 approximately 48 of aps’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’ wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power risks in connection with the costs of serving retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’ native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps markets hedges and trades in electricity and fuels 

environmental matters 

climate change 

legislative and regulatory initiatives in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions on june 26 2009 the house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act of 2009 hr 2454 in addition to establishing clean energy programs hr 2454 would establish a greenhouse gas emission capandtrade system starting in 2012 applicable to about 85 of all emission sources in the nation a similar bill kerryboxer bill s 1733 is pending before the senate both of these bills would allocate a certain number of allowances to local distribution companies such as aps through 2030 

to the extent aps’ emissions exceed the allowances allocated to it under these proposed bills aps would have an “allowance gap” aps would have to purchase enough allowances from the market to fill these gaps the table below illustrates the estimated cost impacts to aps in 2012 to acquire allowances to fill its allowance gap and the associated retail rate impacts to customers under hr 2454 and s 1733 for purposes of this illustration the table provides three assumed allowance prices of 20 50 and 75 per metric ton 

 

the actual economic and operational impact of this or any similar legislation on the company depends on a variety of factors none of which can be fully known until such legislation passes and the specifics of the resulting program are established these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions whether the permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance at the present time we cannot predict what form of legislation if any will ultimately pass 

  12 

the epa recently determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act the recent endangerment finding could result in the epa issuing new regulatory requirements under the clean air act for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources including power plants on september 30 2009 the epa announced a proposed rule under the clean air act requiring certain new and modified stationary sources including power plants to use the best available control technology to minimize greenhouse gas emissions several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the epa’s endangerment finding at the present time we cannot predict whether the proposed stationary source rule will be adopted in its current or a revised form what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from the epa’s finding whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding will be successful and what impact the proposed rule and potential other rules or regulations will have on aps’ operations 

in anticipation of potential future regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act as described above on september 22 2009 the epa issued a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule the rule applies to direct greenhouse gas emissions from facilities such as aps’ power plants we expect that our incremental costs to comply with this rule will be immaterial since aps already routinely reports co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions from its plants 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives state specific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has not yet enacted any state specific legislation regarding greenhouse gas emissions the california legislature enacted ab 32 and sb 1368 in 2006 to address greenhouse gas emissions and new mexico is currently considering proposed legislation to address these issues we are monitoring these and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants 

if any emission reduction legislation or regulations are enacted we will assess our compliance alternatives which may include replacement of existing equipment installation of additional pollution control equipment purchase of allowances retirement or suspension of operations at certain coalfired facilities or other actions although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation could be material we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our rates 

regional initiative  in 2007 six western states arizona california new mexico oregon utah and washington and two canadian provinces british columbia and manitoba entered into an accord the western climate initiative “wci” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and certain industries including utilities montana quebec and ontario have also joined wci wci participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 15 below 2005 levels by 2020 after soliciting public comment in september 2008 wci issued the design of a capandtrade program for greenhouse gas emissions due in part to the recent activity at the federal level discussed above the initiative’s momentum and the movement toward detailed proposed rules has slowed on february 2 2010 arizona’s governor issued an executive order stating that arizona will continue to be a member of wci to monitor its advancements in this area but it will not implement the wci regional capandtrade program as a result while we continue to monitor the progress of wci at the present time we do not believe it will have a material impact on our operations

company response to climate change initiatives  we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency and implementation of an active technology innovation effort to evaluate potential emerging new technologies aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources 

on may 18 2009 we submitted a comprehensive climate change management plan to the acc to comply with an acc order that directed aps to undertake a climate management plan carbon emission reduction study and commitment and action plan with public input and acc review the climate change management plan details scientific legislative and policy issues potential physical and financial risks to aps greenhouse gas emission inventory aps technology innovation and greenhouse gas reduction efforts and our companies’ strategic approach to climate change management 

in january 2008 aps joined the climate registry as a founding reporter founding reporters are companies that voluntarily joined the nonprofit organization before may 2008 to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions in a common accurate and transparent manner consistent across industry sectors and borders aps will not participate in the climate registry after 2009 because we will be reporting substantially the same information under the new epa reporting rule pinnacle west has also reported and will continue to report greenhouse gas emissions in its annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom   in addition to emissions data the report provides information related to the company its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance as well as a copy of our climate change management plan discussed above the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

climate change lawsuits in february 2008 the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california against nine oil companies fourteen power companies including pinnacle west and a coal company alleging that the defendants’ emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and constitute a public and private nuisance the plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages in june 2008 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action which were granted the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the court in november 2009 we believe the action is without merit and intend to continue to defend against the claims 

similar nuisance lawsuits are currently pending in the 2nd and 5th circuits in the fall of 2009 the us courts of appeals for each of these circuits reversed lower court decisions and ruled that the plaintiffs in both cases could bring common law nuisance lawsuits against coalburning utilities allegedly contributing to global warming both cases as well as the kivalina case raise political and legal considerations including whether the courts can or should be making climate change policy decisions we are not a party to either of these two lawsuits but will monitor these developments and their potential industry impacts

epa environmental regulation 

regional haze rules over a decade ago the epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas the rules require states or for sources located on tribal land the epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the “best available retrofit technology” “bart” for certain older major stationary sources the epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 

adeq is currently undertaking a rulemaking process to address the clean air visibility rule requirements adeq’s rules were due to epa region 9 in december 2007 but are expected to be submitted in 2010 as part of the rulemaking process adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla aps completed a bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq on february 4 2008 the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart once aps receives adeq’s final determination as to what constitutes bart for cholla we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by adeq however in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities aps is currently implementing portions of its recommended plan for cholla on a voluntary basis costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

epa region 9 requested that aps as the operating agent for four corners and srp as the operating agent for the navajo plant perform a bart analysis for four corners and the navajo plant respectively aps and srp each submitted an analysis to the epa concluding that certain combustion control equipment constitutes bart for these plants based on the analyses and comments received through epa’s rulemaking process the epa will determine what it believes constitutes bart for each plant 

the epa recently issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr seeking public comments on what constitutes bart for each plant the public comment period expired in october 2009 but the epa has extended the comment period until march 20 2010 for the navajo and hopi tribes we expect that the epa will issue proposed and final bart determinations for four corners and the navajo plant in 2010 the participant owners of four corners and the navajo plant will have five years after the epa issues its final determination to achieve compliance with their respective bart requirements in addition on february 16 2010 a group of environmental organizations filed a petition with the departments of interior and agriculture requesting those agencies to certify to the epa that visibility impairment in sixteen national park and wilderness areas is reasonably attributable to emissions from four corners if the agencies certify impairment the epa is required to evaluate and if necessary determine bart for four corners 

aps’ recommended plan for four corners includes the installation of combustion control equipment with an estimated cost to aps based on preliminary engineering estimates and aps’ four corners ownership interest of approximately 50 million if the epa determines that postcombustion controls are required aps’ total costs could be up to approximately 422 million for four corners srp’s recommended plan for the navajo plant includes the installation of combustion control equipment with an estimated cost to aps of approximately 6 million based on aps’ navajo ownership interest if the epa determines that postcombustion controls are required aps’ total costs could be up to approximately 93 million for navajo the four corners and navajo plant participants’ obligations to comply with the epa’s final bart determinations coupled with the financial impact of future climate change legislation other environmental regulations and other business considerations could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  15 

in order to coordinate with each plant’s other scheduled activities the plants are currently implementing portions of their recommended plans described above on a voluntary basis aps’ share of the costs related to the implementation of these portions of the recommended plans are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants in early 2008 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the clean air mercury rule “camr” which was adopted by the epa to regulate mercury emissions from coal fired power plants as a result the law in effect prior to the adoption of the camr became the applicable law and the epa is now required to adopt final maximum achievable control technology emissions “mact” standards under a proposed consent decree the epa has agreed to issue final mact standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by november 2011 if the consent decree is finalized in its current form aps will have three years after the epa issues its final rule to achieve compliance which would likely require aps to install additional pollution control equipment 

aps has installed and continues to install certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next three years for such equipment are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital expenditures” in item 7 

federal implementation plan “fip” in september 1999 the epa proposed fips to set air quality standards at certain power plants including four corners and the navajo plant which it later revised in 2006 the fip for four corners was finalized in 2009 and we do not believe compliance with its required limits will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the proposed fip for the navajo plant is still pending aps cannot currently predict the effect of this proposed fip on its financial position results of operations or cash flows or whether the proposed fip will be adopted in its current form 

coal combustion waste the epa is expected to issue proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion byproducts “ccbs” such as fly ash and bottom ash aps currently disposes of ccbs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production the epa is evaluating options that include regulation of ccbs under nonhazardous waste standards hazardous waste standards or a combination of both and a potential phase out of the disposal of ccbs through the use of ash ponds a proposed rule is expected during the first quarter of 2010 we do not know when the epa will issue a final rule including required compliance dates while aps continues to advocate for the regulation of ccbs as nonhazardous waste we cannot currently predict the outcome of the epa’s actions and whether such actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

section 114 request  on april 6 2009 aps received a request from the epa under section 114 of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners this request is part of an enforcement initiative that the epa has undertaken under the clean air act the epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the new source review provisions of the clean air act “nsr” other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section 114 requests and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits by the epa aps has responded to the epa’s request and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of epa’s response if any or any resulting actions

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often are jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 in addition on september 23 2009 aps agreed with the epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the sitewide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan aps estimates that its costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately 12 million which is reserved as a liability on its financial statements we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time we cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures 

by letter dated april 25 2008 the epa informed aps that it may be a prp in the gila river indian reservation superfund site in maricopa county arizona aps along with three other electric utility companies owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a transmission line are located the property abuts the gila river indian community boundary and at one time may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place currently the epa is only seeking payment from aps and four other prps for past cleanuprelated costs involving contamination from the crop dusting based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the epa in its letter to aps we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on aps’ financial position results of operations or cash flows 

manufactured gas plant sites certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “energy sources and planning — generation — coal fueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

  17 

in april 2000 the navajo tribal council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo plant and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act as a result of this agreement aps sought and the courts granted dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions 

both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’ other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

  18 

aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’ groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights a number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

regulatory risks 

our financial condition depends upon aps’ ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services while approved electric rates are intended to permit aps to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and the ferc in connection with its recent rate case settlement agreement aps agreed not to request its next general retail rate increase to be effective prior to july 1 2012 the acc must also approve aps’ issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates decisions made by the acc and the ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps’ ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal state or local statutes and regulations and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits approvals and certificates 

aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs and orders of agencies that regulate aps’ business including the ferc the nrc the epa and state and local governmental agencies these agencies regulate many aspects of aps’ utility operations including safety and performance emissions siting and construction of facilities customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers failure to comply can subject aps to among other things fines and penalties for example under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards aps underwent its first mandatory regularlyscheduled triennial audit for compliance with these standards in early 2010 and expects to receive its results by mid2010 in addition aps is required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from these agencies aps believes the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps’ business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies  

  22 

the operation of aps’ nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved aps was subject to this heightened scrutiny until march 2009 when it exited the nrc’s enhanced inspection regime the increased costs resulting from penalties a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps’ financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and changes in or liabilities under existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps’ cost of operations or impact its business plans 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits and other approvals if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

environmental clean up aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

regional haze aps is currently awaiting final rulemaking from the epa that could impose new requirements on four corners and the navajo plant aps is also awaiting final rulemaking from adeq that could impose new requirements on cholla the epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants depending upon the agencies’ final determinations of what constitutes bart for these plants the financial impact of installing the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of the plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 

  23 

coal ash recently congress directed the epa to propose new federal regulations governing the disposal of ccbs which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of among other things fly ash and bottom ash aps currently disposes of ccbs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products if the epa regulates ccbs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps’ ability to dispose of ccbs through the use of ash ponds aps could incur significant costs for ccb disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 

new source review the epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger nsr requirements under the clean air act the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not result in emissions increases and thus are not subject to nsr aps received and responded to a request from the epa regarding projects and operations of four corners if the epa seeks to impose nsr requirements at four corners or any other aps plant either through a lawsuit or a notice of violation significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies the epa could also seek civil penalties 

mercury and other hazardous air pollutants the epa is required to adopt maximum achievable control technology emissions standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by november 2011 depending on the compliance requirements contained in the final rule aps may need to make significant capital investments to install additional pollution control equipment to meet these new standards 

aps cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’ customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions in addition lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases including a lawsuit filed by the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina alaska against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change which was dismissed but has been appealed 

physical and operational risks projections for the southwest united states from climate change models include an increase in the number of extreme hot days in the summer less precipitation in the form of snow and the earlier runoff of snowmelt increased wildfire potential and the potential for water shortages assuming that the primary physical and operational risks to aps from climate change are increased potential for drought or water shortage and a mild to moderate increase in ambient temperatures aps believes it is taking the appropriate steps at this time to respond to these risks weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest’s desert area and these are risk factors that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system large increases in ambient temperature due to climate change could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represents a greater challenge 

  24 

financial risks — potential legislation and regulation  in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions the house of representatives approved a bill that would establish a greenhouse gas emission capandtrade system and the senate is currently considering proposed legislation there is growing consensus that some form of regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions 

if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which aps operates ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases any resulting limitations on generation facility co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coalfired facilities which constitute approximately 28 of aps’ generation capacity a capandtrade program may also result in counterparty credit risk and financial liquidity risk since collateral is typically exchanged between counterparties as a means of mitigating risk in the event of a counterparty default 

at the state level the california legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas emissions this legislation and other statespecific initiatives may affect aps’ business including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its outofstate power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coalfired power plants including four corners following expiration of the current lease term in 2016 

in addition the epa recently determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare this determination was made in response to a 2007 united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act the recent endangerment finding could result in the epa issuing new regulatory requirements under the clean air act beyond those related to motor vehicle emissions which could impact aps’ power plants and result in substantial additional costs excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could force aps and other similarlysituated electric power generators to retire or suspend operations at certain coalfired facilities 

if aps cannot meet or maintain the level of renewable energy required under arizona’s increasing renewable energy standards or the higher commitment levels established in the settlement agreement aps may be subject to penalties or fines for noncompliance 

the renewable energy standard and tariff “res” requires aps to supply an increasing percentage of renewable energy each year so that the amount of retail electricity sales from eligible renewable resources is at least 25 of total retail sales by 2010 this amount increases annually to 15 by 2025 in its recent retail rate case settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed these standards and committed to an interim renewable energy target of 10 by year end 2015 a portion of this total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 20 of the overall res requirement of 25 in 2010 and increases to 30 of the applicable res requirement in 2012 and subsequent years if aps fails to implement any of its annual accapproved renewable resource plans it may be subject to penalties imposed by the acc including aps’ inability to recover certain costs compliance with the distributed resource requirement is contingent upon customer participation the development of any renewable generation facilities resulting from the res is subject to many other risks including risks relating to financing permitting technology fuel supply and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities 

  25 

deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on aps’ business and its results of operations 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’ service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result aps cannot predict if when and the extent to which additional competitors may reenter aps’ service territory 

currently there are two matters pending with the acc that involve a business model where customers pay solar vendors for the installation and operation of solar facilities based on the amount of energy produced the acc must make a determination whether these entities would be considered “public service corporations” under the arizona constitution causing them to be regulated by the acc use of such products by customers within aps’ territory would result in some level of competition 

as a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers nonutility generators independent power producers and wholesale power marketers and brokers this increased competition could affect aps’ load forecasts plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues as a result of the changing regulatory environment and the relatively low barriers to entry we expect wholesale competition to increase which could adversely affect our business 

operational risks 

aps’ results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 

weather conditions weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result aps’ overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish aps’ results of operations and harm its financial condition 

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten aps’ communities and electric transmission lines any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps’ results of operations 

  26 

effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy the acc has initiated a rulemaking regarding energy efficiency which includes a proposed 22 annual energy savings requirement by 2020 if adopted this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and demandside management efforts which in turn would impact the demand for electricity the proposed rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost incomerevenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements the retail rate case settlement agreement establishes energy efficiency goals for aps that begin in 2010 subjecting aps to energy efficiency requirements in advance of the proposed rules described above 

aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements a portion of aps’ total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties the distributed energy requirement is 20 of the overall res requirement of 25 in 2010 and increases to 30 of the applicable res requirement in 2012 and subsequent years customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements unless offset through regulatory mechanisms could have a material adverse impact on aps’ financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power outages or reduced output which could materially affect aps’ results of operations  

the operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps’ business if aps’ facilities operate below expectations especially during its peak seasons it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps’ business and results of operations 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ generating plants have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps’ inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

certain aps power plants including four corners and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods aps is currently unable to predict the outcome of discussions with the appropriate indian tribes with respect to future renewal of these easements and rightsofway 

  27 

there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health fuel supply spent fuel disposal regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

aps has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of owners palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage in addition aps may be required under federal law to pay up to 103 million but not more than 15 million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

the operation of palo verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed andor extended in december 2008 aps applied for renewed operating licenses for all three palo verde units for 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses aps does not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses however as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict 

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

aps’ operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

congress is considering legislation to impose restrictions on the use of overthecounter derivatives including energy derivatives which could subject aps to governmental regulation relating to these hedging transactions if such legislation becomes law aps could potentially face higher costs to hedge its risks fewer potential counterparties still active in the newlyregulated marketplace and increased liquidity requirements 

  28 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

changes in technology may adversely affect aps’ business 

research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce power including fuel cells micro turbines clean coal and coal gasification photovoltaic solar cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’ generating facilities less competitive in addition advances in technology could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’ business 

aps is pursuing and implementing advanced technologies including smart grid transmission and distribution systems and advanced meters for use in customers’ homes and businesses many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested and their use on largescale systems is not as advanced and established as aps’ existing technologies and equipment uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect aps’ business if national standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to perform as expected 

financial risks 

financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

we rely on access to shortterm money markets longerterm capital markets and the bank markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets such disruptions could include 

 

 

 

 

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting our lenders which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

  29 

changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

 

 

 

 

a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our current ratings are set forth in “pinnacle west consolidated — liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings” in item 7 we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’ securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could completely eliminate any possible future access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

market performance changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase our related obligations resulting in significant additional funding that could negatively impact our business 

disruptions in the capital markets may adversely affect the values of fixed income and equity investments held in our employee benefit plan trusts and nuclear decommissioning trusts we have significant obligations in these areas and hold substantial assets in these trusts a decline in the market value of these trusts may increase our funding requirements additionally the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are impacted by the discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates impact the discount rate and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans a significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices our inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner or any increased funding obligations could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  30 

we may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards “ifrs” the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board that is being considered by the sec to replace accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” for use in preparation of financial statements if the sec requires mandatory adoption of ifrs we may lose our ability to use regulatory accounting treatment and would follow ifrs rather than gaap for the preparation of our financial statements beginning in 2014 the implementation and adoption of these new standards and the inability to use regulatory accounting could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries 

we conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries accordingly our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us 

the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our subsidiaries 

because we are structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities none of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

 

  31 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

 

 

 

 

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

  32 

suncor’s business and financial results would be adversely affected if it is unable to extend modify or renew its credit facilities or repay its debt through sales of its remaining assets 

at december 31 2009 suncor had borrowings of approximately 57 million under its principal loan facility the secured revolver the secured revolver matured on january 30 2010 and suncor and the agent bank for the secured revolver are discussing an extension of the maturity date to allow time for suncor to continue discussions concerning the potential sale of additional properties in addition to the secured revolver at december 31 2009 suncor had approximately 43 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities 9 million of which has matured since december 31 2009 and remains outstanding 

if suncor is unable to obtain an extension or renewal of the secured revolver or its other matured debt or if it is unable to comply with the mandatory repayment and other provisions of any new or modified credit agreements suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of crossdefault provisions such an immediate repayment obligation would have a material adverse impact on suncors business and financial position and impair its ongoing viability 

suncor intends to apply the proceeds of its planned asset sales to the repayment of its outstanding debt if it is unable to locate suitable buyers and close certain asset sales or obtain sufficient proceeds from these sales to maintain or pay off its existing debt it may be unable to satisfy obligations under its credit facilities resulting in the immediate repayment obligations described above 

suncor cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its lenders or its ability to sell assets for sufficient proceeds to repay its outstanding debt suncors ability to generate sufficient cash from operations while it pursues lender negotiations and further asset sales is uncertain 

the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness as a result we do not believe that suncors inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle wests cash flows or liquidity any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle wests consolidated financial statements if suncor were required to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws pinnacle west could be exposed to the uncertainties and complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings 

during 2008 and 2009 the real estate market weakened significantly resulting in lower land and home sales and depressed real estate prices as a result in 2008 and 2009 suncor recognized certain impairment charges suncor may be required to record additional impairments 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2009 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

see “business of arizona public service company” in item 1 for a map detailing the location of aps’ major power plants and principal transmission lines 

transmission and distribution facilities 

current facilities  aps’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5946 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines 5723 miles of which are located in arizona aps’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 11362 miles of overhead lines and approximately 17308 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’ jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 

 

expansion each year aps prepares and files with the acc a tenyear transmission plan in aps’ 2010 plan aps projects it will invest approximately 520 million in new transmission over the next ten years which includes 270 miles of new lines this investment will increase the import capability into metropolitan phoenix by approximately 26 and will increase the import capability into the yuma area by approximately 38 one significant project presently under construction is the morgan  pinnacle peak project which consists of 26 miles of 500kv and 230kv lines aps completed two major substation projects in 2009 the dugas substation 50069kv will provide system voltage support and capacity for the verde valley area and the sugarloaf substation 50069kv will provide system voltage support and capacity for the show low and snowflake areas and will also support renewable energy development in that area 

aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities two such projects which are included in aps’ 2010 transmission plan are the delany to palo verde line and the north gila to palo verde line both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california 

  35 

plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands 

the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under easements from the federal government the easement and lease for the navajo plant expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for four corners expire in 2016 each of the leases contains an option to extend for an additional 25year period from the end of the existing lease term for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index the easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or extension of the easements may be imposed the ultimate cost of renewal of the navajo plant and four corners leases and easements is uncertain the coal contracted for use in these plants is also located on indian reservations 

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation the four corners and navajo plant leases provide navajo nation consent to certain of the rightsofway for transmission lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the rightsofway and for a like payment in any renewal period in addition a 1985 amendment to the leases provides a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rightsofway however some of our rightsofway are not covered by the leases or are granted by other indian tribes in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rightsofway certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway or that are typical for similar permits across nonindian lands however we are unaware of the underlying agreements andor specific circumstances surrounding these renewals the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is uncertain we are monitoring these rightsofway and easement issues and have initiated discussions with the navajo nation regarding them we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’ financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report for information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see “forwardlooking statements” at the front of this report and “risk factors” in item 1a 

overview 

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps accounts for substantially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

areas of business focus 

operational performance and reliability 

nuclear palo verde experienced strong performance during 2009 with its three units achieving a combined yearend capacity factor of 89 with a focus on safely and efficiently generating electricity for the longterm aps applied for twentyyear renewals of its operating licenses for each of the three palo verde units and is making preparations to secure necessary resources to operate the plant during this extended period of time palo verde’s 2009 accomplishments also included the installation of a new reactor vessel head upgraded equipment and processes designed to substantially reduce the time required to defuel and refuel the reactor during refueling outages and the successful implementation of a comprehensive improvement plan which allowed palo verde unit 3 to exit the nrc’s enhanced inspection regime “column 4” earlier than anticipated in march of 2009 

coal and related environmental matters aps’ coal plants four corners and cholla achieved net capacity factors of 88 and 77 respectively in 2009 aps is focused on developing legislation and increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impacts on our coal fleet recent concern over climate change and other emissionrelated issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants aps is closely monitoring our long range capital management plans understanding that the resulting legislation and regulation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades see “business of arizona public service company — environmental matters — climate change” in item 1 and climate changerelated risks described in item 1a for additional climate change developments and risks facing aps 

  44 

transmission and delivery in the area of transmission and delivery to its customers aps also ranked favorably during 2009 with top quartile performance for average customer outage time during 2009 aps undertook several significant transmission projects including the morgan to pinnacle peak transmission line scheduled for completion at the end of 2010 and the completion of two switchyards one of which will support capacity for renewable energy projects aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology throughout its service territory designed to provide a variety of benefits both to aps and its customers this technology should allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations and the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

renewable energy aps is committed to increasing the amount of energy produced by renewable energy resources which was a significant focus in aps’ recent rate case settlement described below aps and the other parties to the rate case worked with the acc commissioners to address a wide range of customer needs and to secure a clean sustainable energy future for arizona the acc adopted a renewable energy standard several years ago recognizing the importance of renewable energy to our state in the rate case settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed these standards committing that 10 of aps’ resources will come from renewable energy by the year 2015 a variety of other provisions in the settlement agreement reinforce aps’ dedication to renewable energy through initiatives to build a photovoltaic solar plant install solar rooftop panels on schools and seek an arizona wind generation project 

during 2009 aps filed its annual res implementation plan that included a request for acc approval of the “az sun program” as proposed in its plan aps would invest an estimated 500 million to develop at least 100 mw of photovoltaic solar plants it currently anticipates that this solar capacity would be placed into service in the 2011 to 2014 timeframe the ultimate timing depends on the outcome of current and future procurement processes see note 3 for additional details regarding this program including the estimated timing of the acc’s determination on the matter and the related cost recovery aps also issued two requests for proposal “rfp” for renewable resources in early 2010 these rfp’s are part of the process for procuring the additional renewable resources required under the rate case settlement the first rfp is for utilityscale solar photovoltaic projects between 15 and 50 mw assuming acc approval of the az sun program as proposed this rfp will serve as the first procurement step for implementing that program the second rfp is for wind projects between 15 and 100 mw to be located within arizona 

rate matters aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health aps’ retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc at the end of 2009 the acc approved a settlement agreement entered into by aps and twentyone of the twentythree other parties to aps’ general retail rate case with modifications that did not materially affect the overall economic terms of the agreement the rate case settlement should strengthen aps’ financial condition by allowing for rate stability and a greater level of cost recovery and return on investment it also authorizes and requires equity infusions into aps of at least 700 million prior to the end of 2014 the settlement demonstrates cooperation among aps the acc staff the residential utility consumer office ruco and other intervenors to the rate case and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows aps the opportunity to help shape arizona’s energy future outside of continual rate cases see note 3 for a detailed discussion of the settlement agreement terms and information on aps’ ferc rates 

aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its energy efficiency demandside management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note 3 

  45 

financial strength and flexibility despite the volatility and disruption of the credit markets pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company in early february 2010 aps entered into a 500 million revolving credit facility replacing its 377 million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in december 2010 at that same time pinnacle west entered into a 200 million revolving credit facility that replaces its 283 million facility that also would have otherwise terminated in december 2010 

suncor real estate operations as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets during 2009 suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations masterplanned communities land parcels commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt this resulted in impairment charges of approximately 266 million or 161 million after income taxes for 2009 see “pinnacle west consolidated — liquidity and capital resources — other subsidiaries — suncor” below for a discussion of suncor’s outstanding debt and related matters note 23 for a further discussion of impairment charges and the suncorrelated risk factor in item 1a 

subsidiaries our other first tier subsidiaries el dorado and apses are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years 

key financial drivers 

in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company’s current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 

electric operating revenues for the years 2007 through 2009 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 94 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps’ retail customers through the psa these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices 

customer and sales growth customer growth in aps’ service territory for the year ended december 31 2009 was 06 compared with the prior year for the three years 2007 through 2009 aps’ customer growth averaged 18 per year we currently expect customer growth to average about 1 per year for 2010 through 2012 due to economic conditions both nationally and in arizona retail sales in kilowatthours adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations for 2009 declined 24 compared to the prior year reflecting the poor economic conditions in 2009 and the effects of our energy efficiency programs for the three years 2007 through 2009 aps’ actual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations grew at an average annual rate of 03 we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will remain flat on average per year during 2010 through 2012 including the effects of aps’ energy efficiency programs but excluding the effects of weather variations a continuation of the economic downturn or the failure of the arizona economy to rebound in the near future could further impact these estimates the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers 

  46 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns impacts of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

weather in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the amortization thereof 

operations and maintenance expenses  operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues and other factors in its recent retail rate case settlement aps committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through 2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases to be incurred in 2011 and 2012 

depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates the “capital expenditures” section below provides information regarding the planned additions to our facilities we have also applied to the nrc for renewed operating licenses for each of the palo verde units if the nrc grants the extension we estimate that our annual pretax depreciation expense will decrease by approximately 34 million at the later of the license extension date or january 1 2012 

property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 75 of the assessed value for 2009 78 of the assessed value for 2008 and 83 of the assessed value for 2007 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant including new generation transmission and distribution facilities described below under “capital additions” and as we improve our existing facilities 

  47 

income taxes  income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income income tax rates and certain nontaxable items such as the allowance for equity funds used during construction in addition income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 

interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities and internally generated cash flow capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

pinnacle west consolidated — results of operations 

our results of operations provided below are based upon our two reportable business segments 

 

 

operating results — 2009 compared with 2008 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2009 was 68 million compared with net income of 242 million for the prior year the decrease in net income was primarily due to 2009 real estate impairment charges recorded by suncor the company’s real estate subsidiary 

in addition regulated electricity segment net income decreased approximately 13 million from the prior year primarily due to lower retail sales resulting from lower usage per customer higher interest charges net of capitalized financing costs higher depreciation and amortization expenses and the absence of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008 these negative factors were partially offset by increased revenues due to the interim rate increase effective january 1 2009 and transmission rate increases

the following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior year 

 

 regulated electricity segment

operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses 

regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were 127 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year the following table describes the major components of this change 

 

operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased 66 million for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

 

 

  50 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased 17 million for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of increases in utility plant in service the increases in utility plant in service are the result of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear generating plants and distribution and transmission infrastructure additions and upgrades 

interest charges net of capitalized financing costs interest charges net of capitalized financing costs increased 28 million for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher debt balances partially offset by the effects of lower interest rates see discussion related to aps’ debt issuances in “pinnacle west consolidated — liquidity and capital resources” below interest charges net of capitalized financing costs are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the line items interest expense capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds used during construction from the consolidated statements of income

income taxes income taxes were 50 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of 30 million of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008 and higher pretax income see note 4 

real estate segment 

during the first quarter of 2009 we decided to restructure suncor through the sale of substantially all of its assets the real estate segment net loss attributable to common shareholders was 141 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

 

 

all other 

all other earnings were 20 million lower for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of planned reductions of marketing and trading activities and the absence of the 2008 resolution of certain tax issues associated with the sale of silverhawk in 2005 

operating results — 2008 compared with 2007 

our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2008 was 242 million compared with net income of 307 million for the prior year the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower results recorded by suncor the company’s real estate subsidiary 

  51 

in addition regulated electricity segment net income decreased approximately 18 million from the prior year primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses lower retail sales due to the effects of weather higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher interest charges net of capitalized financing costs these negative factors were partially offset by increased revenues due to the rate increase effective july 1 2007 transmission rate increases and income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008

pinnacle west consolidated — liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

the following table presents net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

the increase of approximately 217 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a reduction of collateral and margin cash required as a result of changes in commodity prices and a 2009 income tax refund see note 4 

the decrease of approximately 110 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures net of contributions see table and discussion below partially offset by lower real estate sales primarily due to a commercial property sale in 2008 

the increase of approximately 337 million in net cash used for financing activities is primarily due to repayments of shortterm borrowings partially offset by aps’ issuance of 500 million of unsecured senior notes see note 6 

2008 compared with 2007 

the increase of approximately 156 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower current income taxes lower real estate investments resulting from the weak real estate market and increased retail revenue related to higher base fuel rates partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the decrease of approximately 58 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to a real estate commercial property sale in 2008 lower levels of capital expenditures see table and discussion below and increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in 2008 in aps’ line extension policy see note 3 partially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities 

  55 

the decrease of approximately 134 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the use of the proceeds from the sale of a real estate commercial property to pay down longterm debt in 2008 partially offset by higher levels of shortterm debt borrowings 

liquidity 

capital expenditure requirements 

the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for 2007 2008 and 2009 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 

capital expenditures dollars in millions 

 

 

generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear plants examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment environmental expenditures for the years 2010 2011 and 2012 are approximately 20 million 80 million and 220 million respectively we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters which depending on their final outcome could require modification to our environmental expenditures see “business of arizona public service company — environmental matters — epa environmental regulation — regional haze rules and mercury and other hazardous air pollutants” in item 1 

  56 

distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems 

capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash andor external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

pinnacle west parent company 

our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our longterm debt the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

on january 20 2010 the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0525 per share of common stock payable on march 1 2010 to shareholders of record on february 1 2010 

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external debt and equity financings for the years 2007 through 2009 total distributions from aps were 510 million and total distributions received from suncor were 5 million for 2009 cash distributions from aps were 170 million and there were no distributions from suncor 

an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2009 aps’ common equity ratio as defined was 50 its total common equity was approximately 34 billion and total capitalization was approximately 68 billion aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below approximately 27 billion assuming aps’ total capitalization remains the same 

the credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning the third quarter of 2008 since the fourth quarter of 2008 pinnacle west and aps have not accessed the commercial paper market due to negative market conditions they have both been able to access existing credit facilities ensuring adequate liquidity 

at december 31 2009 pinnacle west had a 283 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to terminate in december 2010 the revolver was available to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit of up to 94 million the parent company had 149 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility and no letters of credit at december 31 2009 

on february 12 2010 pinnacle west refinanced its 283 million revolving credit facility that would have matured in december 2010 and decreased the size of the facility to 200 million the new revolving credit facility terminates in february 2013 pinnacle west may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of 300 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders pinnacle west will use the facility for general corporate purposes repayment of longterm debt and for the issuance of letters of credit interest rates are based on pinnacle west’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings in addition because of the downsized revolving credit facility the company is in the process of reducing the size of its commercial paper program to 200 million from 250 million 

  57 

pinnacle west expects to recognize approximately 125 million of cash tax benefits related to suncor’s strategic asset sales see note 23 which will not be realized until the asset sale transactions are completed approximately 105 million of these benefits were recorded in 2009 as reductions to income tax expense related to the current impairment charges the additional 20 million of tax benefits were recorded as reductions to income tax expense related to the suncor impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 

the 91 million income tax receivable current and longterm on the consolidated balance sheets represents the anticipated cash refunds related to an aps tax accounting method change approved by the united states internal revenue service “irs” in the third quarter of 2009 and the expected tax benefits related to the suncor strategic asset sales that closed in 2009 

pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries irs regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation the assets in the plan are comprised of fixedincome equity and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions we made no contribution to our pension plan in 2009 we currently estimate that our pension contributions could average around 100 million for several years assuming the discount rate remains at approximately current levels in january 2010 we made a voluntary contribution of approximately 50 million to our pension plan and we expect to make an additional voluntary contribution of 50 million later in 2010 the contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2010 is estimated to be approximately 15 million aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions aps’ share is approximately 97 of both plans 

see note 3 for information regarding the recent retail rate case settlement which includes acc authorization and requires equity infusions into aps of at least 700 million by december 31 2014 pinnacle west intends to issue equity to provide most of the funds for the equity infusions into aps such equity issuances may occur at any time in the period through 2014 in pinnacle west’s discretion 

in may 2007 pinnacle west infused approximately 40 million of equity into aps consisting of proceeds of stock issuances in 2006 under pinnacle west’s investors advantage plan direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock plans 

aps 

aps’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and mandatory redemptions of longterm debt aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary equity infusions from pinnacle west and external financings see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 

on february 26 2009 aps issued 500 million of 875 unsecured senior notes that mature on march 1 2019 net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay shortterm borrowings under two committed revolving lines of credit incurred to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 

  58 

during 2009 aps refinanced approximately 343 million of its 656 million pollution control bonds as a result of these refinancings the terms of which are described in detail in note 6 aps no longer has any outstanding debt securities in auction rate mode 

on september 11 2008 aps purchased all of the approximately 27 million of the coconino pollution control revenue bonds series 1996a and series 1999 due december 2031 and april 2034 and held them as treasury bonds on september 22 2009 coconino issued approximately 27 million of coconino pollution control revenue refunding bonds 2009 series b due april 2038 to redeem the existing bonds aps used the funds received from the issuance to repay certain existing indebtedness under a revolving line of credit drawn upon by aps to fund its purchase of the 1996a and 1999 series bonds in 2008 the 2009 series b bonds are payable solely from revenues obtained from aps pursuant to a loan agreement between aps and coconino according to the indenture of the bonds the interest rate of the 2009 series b bonds could be reset daily weekly monthly or at other time intervals the initial rate period selected for the 2009 series b bonds is a daily rate period at december 31 2009 the daily interest rate was 026 the daily rates are variable rates set by a remarketing agent concurrently with the issuance of the 2009 series b bonds the company entered into a two year letter of credit and reimbursement agreement to provide credit support for the 2009 series b bonds 

at december 31 2009 aps had two committed revolving credit facilities totaling 866 million of which 377 million was scheduled to terminate in december 2010 and 489 million terminates in september 2011 the revolvers were available either to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit up to 583 million at december 31 2009 aps had no borrowings and no letters of credit under its revolving lines of credit 

on february 12 2010 aps refinanced its 377 million revolving credit facility that would have matured in december 2010 and increased the size of the facility to 500 million the new revolving credit facility terminates in february 2013 aps may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of 700 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders aps will use the facility for general corporate purposes and for the issuance of letters of credit interest rates are based on aps’ senior unsecured debt credit ratings 

other financing matters — see note 3 for information regarding the psa approved by the acc although aps defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis aps’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and if necessary periodic psa adjustments 

see note 3 for information regarding the recent retail rate case settlement which includes acc authorization and requires equity infusions into aps of at least 700 million by december 31 2014

other subsidiaries 

suncor — suncors principal loan facility the suncor secured revolver is secured primarily by an interest in land commercial properties land contracts and homes under construction at december 31 2009 suncor had borrowings of approximately 57 million under the secured revolver see note 6 the revolver matured on january 30 2010 suncor and the agent bank for the secured revolver are discussing an extension of the maturity date to allow time for suncor to continue discussions concerning the potential sale of additional properties in addition to the secured revolver at december 31 2009 suncor had approximately 43 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities 9 million of which has matured since december 31 2009 and remains outstanding see notes 5 and 6 suncor intends to apply the proceeds of planned asset sales see note 23 to the repayment of its outstanding debt 

real estate impairment charges recorded throughout 2009 see note 23 resulted in violations of certain covenants contained in the suncor secured revolver and suncors other credit facilities the lenders have taken no enforcement action related to the covenant defaults 

if suncor is unable to obtain an extension or renewal of the secured revolver or its other matured debt or if it is unable to comply with the mandatory repayment and other provisions of any new or modified credit agreements suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of crossdefault provisions such an immediate repayment obligation would have a material adverse impact on suncors business and financial position and impair its ongoing viability 

suncor cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its lenders or its ability to sell assets for sufficient proceeds to repay its outstanding debt suncors ability to generate sufficient cash from operations while it pursues lender negotiations and further asset sales is uncertain 

neither pinnacle west nor any of its other subsidiaries has guaranteed any suncor indebtedness a suncor debt default would not result in a crossdefault of any of the debt of pinnacle west or any of its other subsidiaries while there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of this matter pinnacle west does not believe that suncors inability to obtain waivers or similar relief from suncors lenders would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle wests cash flows or liquidity 

as of december 31 2009 suncor could not transfer any cash dividends to pinnacle west as a result of the covenants mentioned above the restriction does not materially affect pinnacle wests ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements 

el dorado — el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 

apses — apses expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 

debt provisions 

pinnacle west’s and aps’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios certain of aps’ bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2009 the ratio was approximately 52 for pinnacle west and 48 for aps the provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps the interest coverage was approximately 46 times under aps’ bank financing agreements as of december 31 2009 failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

  60 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings 

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’ bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings 

see notes 5 and 6 for further discussions of liquidity matters 

credit ratings 

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 17 2010 are shown below the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’ securities and serve to increase the cost of and limit access to capital it may also require substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments insurance policies natural gas transportation fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts at this time we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover a downward revision to our credit ratings 

 

   61 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are accounted for as operating leases we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and accordingly do not consolidate them see note 9 

aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur under certain circumstances for example the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had occurred as of december 31 2009 aps would have been required to assume approximately 152 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately 153 million 

suncor is the primary beneficiary of certain land development arrangements and accordingly consolidates the variable interest entities the assets and noncontrolling interests reflected in our consolidated balance sheets related to these arrangements were approximately 29 million at december 31 2009 and at december 31 2008 

see note 2 for a discussion of amended accounting guidance relating to vies adopted on january 1 2010 

guarantees and letters of credit 

we have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries 

our parental guarantees for aps relate to commodity energy products in addition pinnacle west has obtained approximately 8 million of surety bonds related to aps’ operations which primarily relate to selfinsured workers’ compensation our credit support instruments enable apses to offer energyrelated products nonperformance or nonpayment under the original contract by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond no liability is currently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to pinnacle west’s current outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries at december 31 2009 we had no guarantees that were in default our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit 

  62 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2009 dollars in millions 

 

 this table excludes 209 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain 

  63 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 782 million of regulatory assets and 766 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 

included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2009 is a regulatory asset of 532 million for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

  64 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2009 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2009 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2009 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2009 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

  65 

derivative accounting 

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is recognized in current earnings 

see “market risks — commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see “fair value measurements” below for additional information on valuation see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting 

fair value measurements 

we apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments nuclear decommissioning trusts certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value and the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting 

our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities the fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets see note 12 for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts 

real estate investment impairments 

we had real estate investments of 120 million and 3 million of home inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 for purposes of evaluating impairment in accordance with guidance on the impairment and disposal of longlived assets we classify our real estate assets such as land under development land held for future development and commercial property as “held and used” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used may not be recoverable we compare the undiscounted cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows we adjust the asset to fair value and recognize an impairment charge the adjusted value becomes the new book value carrying amount for held and used assets we may have real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that are lower than their carrying amounts but are not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amounts

real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating impairment home inventories are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell fair value less cost to sell is evaluated each period to determine if it has changed losses and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount 

we determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk our impairment assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices future construction and land development costs future sales timing and discount rates the assumptions are specific to each project and may vary among projects the discount rates we used to determine fair values at december 31 2009 ranged from 11 to 29 due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process with regard to impairments it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen or as a result of a change in suncor’s strategy we may be required to record additional impairments

in june 2009 the fasb issued amended guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities the model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a vie has changed significantly under the new guidance previously variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a vie based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains andor losses of the entity the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a vie to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity and if so whether it is the primary beneficiary furthermore the amended guidance requires companies to continually evaluate vies for consolidation this guidance was effective for us on january 1 2010 we are continuing to evaluate the impact this new guidance may have on our financial statements

the following table presents aps’ net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

the increase of approximately 174 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a reduction of collateral and margin cash required as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the decrease of approximately 141 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures net of contributions 

the increase of approximately 286 million in net cash used for financing activities is primarily due to repayments of shortterm borrowings partially offset by aps’ issuance of 500 million of unsecured senior notes see note 6 

  77 

2008 compared with 2007 

the increase of approximately 19 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower current income taxes and increased retail revenue related to higher base fuel rates partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the decrease of approximately 2 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures see table and discussion above and increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in 2008 in our line extension policy see note 3 substantially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities 

the increase of approximately 28 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher levels of shortterm borrowings partially offset by decreased equity infusions from pinnacle west and the repurchase of pollution control bonds see note 6

regulation and competition 

retail 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer or encumbrance of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet their own energy requirements 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’ retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers in 2000 an arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision 

to date the acc has taken no final or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision however as a result of a new request for authorization to provide competitive retail electric service by sempra energy solutions llc the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals decision referenced above the acc staff’s report on the results of its investigation is due to be filed with the acc on december 31 2009 at present only limited electric retail competition exists in arizona and only with certain entities not regulated by the acc aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services see “formula transmission tariff” in note 3 for information regarding aps’ transmission rates during 2008 approximately 63 of aps’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’ wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power risks in connection with the costs of serving retail customer energy requirements aps also sells in the wholesale market its generation output that is not needed for aps’ native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally subject to specified parameters aps markets hedges and trades in electricity and fuels 

business of arizona public service company 

general 

aps was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of the state of arizona and currently has approximately 11 million customers aps does not distribute any products during 2008 no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 18 of electric revenues see “overview” and “regulation and competition” above for additional background information about aps

  nuclear generating facility 

  palo verde nuclear generating station – palo verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of phoenix arizona aps operates the plant and owns 291 of palo verde units 1 and 3 and about 17 of unit 2 in addition aps leases about 121 of unit 2 resulting in a 291 combined interest in that unit see “palo verde leases” below for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  palo verde fuel cycle – the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

 

the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2011 the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2013 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services until at least 2015 

  spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal – see “palo verde nuclear generating station” in note 11 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal 

  palo verde leases – in 1986 aps sold about 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions aps accounts for these leases as operating leases the leases which have terms of 295 years contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms we are analyzing this matter and will continue to do so as we approach the end of the lease terms to determine which option or options to pursue see notes 9 and 20 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

  regulatory – operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 the full power operating licenses each valid for a period of approximately 40 years authorize aps as operating agent for palo verde to operate the three palo verde units at full power aps applied for renewed operating licenses for palo verde unit 1 unit 2 and unit 3 on december 15 2008 for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses the nrc is currently reviewing the application 

  nrc inspection – on february 22 2007 the nrc issued a “white” finding low to moderate safety significance due to electrical output issues with the unit 3 emergency diesel generator that occurred in 2006 under the nrc’s action matrix this finding coupled with a previous nrc “yellow” finding relating to a 2004 matter involving palo verde’s safety injection systems resulted in palo verde unit 3 being placed in the “multiplerepetitive degraded cornerstone” column of the nrc’s action matrix “column 4” which has resulted in an enhanced nrc inspection regime 

although only palo verde unit 3 is in nrc’s column 4 in order to adequately assess the need for improvements aps’ management conducted sitewide assessments of equipment and operations 

on june 21 2007 the nrc issued an initial confirmatory action letter confirming aps’ commitments regarding specific actions aps will take to improve palo verde’s performance from october 1 2007 through november 2 2007 a team of nrc inspectors performed onsite indepth inspections of palo verde’s equipment and operations the nrc’s inspection results were documented in an nrc letter to aps dated february 1 2008 the “inspection report” the inspection report indicated that the facility is being operated safely but also identified certain performance deficiencies based on its review of the aps palo verde improvement plan the nrc issued a revised confirmatory action letter the “revised cal” on february 15 2008 that outlines the actions aps must take in order for the nrc to return the palo verde site to the nrc’s routine inspection and assessment process this revised cal was anticipated as part of the nrc’s inspection procedure and a substantial majority of the actions required therein was contained in aps’ improvement plan 

the nrc has continued to provide increased oversight at palo verde the palo verde management team has implemented a substantial majority of its improvement plan and has been subject to routine periodic nrc inspections throughout 2008 on february 5 2009 aps submitted a letter to the nrc stating that it has completed a substantial majority of the actions contained in the revised cal and believes the revised cal can be closed aps will continue cooperating fully with the nrc throughout this process and anticipates receiving a response from the nrc within the next several months related to the closure of the revised cal 

  nuclear decommissioning costs – the nrc rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs through costofservice rates or through a “nonbypassable charge” the “nonbypassable systems benefits” charge is the charge that the acc has approved for aps’ recovery of certain types of costs “nonbypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider” other than aps the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s aps electric bill 

other mechanisms are prescribed including prepayment if the requirements for exclusive reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’ acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism see note 12 for additional information about aps’ nuclear decommissioning costs

in connection with its ongoing resource planning efforts aps continues to focus on increasing the percentage of its energy that is produced by renewable resources on november 1 

2006 the acc approved the arizona renewable energy standard and tariff the “renewable energy standard” under the renewable energy standard electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement increases from 15 in 2007 to 15 in 2025 the requirement for 2009 is 20 in addition an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed resources generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties the distributed resource requirement increases from 5 of the overall renewable energy requirement in 2007 to 30 in 2012 and subsequent years the requirement for 2009 is 15 aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar and biomass which collectively generate over 120 mw of renewable energy for our customers all of the current renewable generation projects except for solar are acquired through longterm purchased power agreements 

on february 8 2008 aps entered into a renewable energy purchase and sale agreement under which aps agreed to purchase the energy and related renewable energy credits from a concentrated solar power plant for a period of thirty years after the plant begins commercial operation the plant which will have a nameplate rating of 280 mw and a projected annual output of 900000 mwh will be located near gila bend arizona which is about 70 miles southwest of phoenix the agreement is subject to various conditions including the developer obtaining project financing if these conditions are met commercial operation is expected in 2012 

on february 28 2008 aps signed a renewable energy purchase and sale agreement under which aps agreed to purchase the energy and related renewable energy credits from a wind power plant located in new mexico for a period of thirty years after the plant begins commercial operation in 2009 the plant has a nameplate rating of 100 mw and a projected annual output of 300000 mwh 

aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio both to ensure its compliance with the renewable energy standard and to meet the needs of its customer base 

  purchased power agreements 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements aps’ purchased power capacity under longterm contracts as of december 31 2008 is summarized in the table below aps also purchases power through shortterm markets to supplement its longterm resources and hedge its energy requirements 

 

 

 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability although aps does not expect to need new capacity beyond current plans until around 2015 aps remains committed to seeking proposals from the competitive wholesale market for filling its future resource needs including renewable resource capacity 

  reserve margin 

aps’ 2008 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on august 1 2008 at 7025900 kw compared to the 2007 peak of 7545100 kw recorded on august 13 2007 taking into account additional capacity then available to aps under longterm purchase power contracts as well as aps’ generating capacity aps’ capability of meeting system demand on august 1 2008 amounted to 6883000 kw for an installed reserve margin of negative 23 the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned 

plant and transmission outages and technical problems the available capacity from sources actually operable at the time of the 2008 peak amounted to 5831000 kw for a margin of negative 219 firm purchases totaling 2626000 kw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases were in place at the time of the peak ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement with an actual reserve margin of 206 

  resource plan 

on january 29 2009 aps submitted a resource plan report to the acc proposing a diverse portfolio of generation resources to address the projected 60 increase in customer peak demand by 2025 which equates to approximately 6500 mw of new capacity resources and accounts for both new resources needed to meet growing customers loads as well as resources that will be needed to replace expiring longterm purchases the primary components of the resource plan include 

 

the resource plan would allow arizona to increase its commitment to nonfossil fuel resources because it does not include new coalfired generation resources the resource plan states that the risk of future climate change legislation and the resulting potential for significant increases in cost currently make coalfired generation an unattractive resource choice the resource plan also addresses the transmission infrastructure expansion that will be required to accommodate the new resources 

under the resource plan aps’ energy mix would change nuclear energy would increase to 32 of its mix renewable energy sources would increase to 16 and energy efficiency would increase to 7 coalfired energy would decrease to 24 and gasfired generation would decrease to 21 

aps has requested the acc to a either formally approve the resource plan or acknowledge that aps has considered all relevant resources risks and uncertainties and that the resource plan is reasonable and in the public interest b determine that the pursuit of renewable resources above the renewable energy standard is in the public interest c determine that taking the initial steps to preserve aps’ ability to pursue a new nuclear baseload resource is in the public interest and d determine that it is appropriate for aps to proceed to implement the resource plan aps cannot predict the outcome of this matter 

transmission and distribution facilities 

aps’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5825 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 45 miles of underground lines 5601 miles of which are located in arizona aps’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 11392 miles of overhead lines and approximately 16630 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’ jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 

 

plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands 

the navajo generating station and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under easements from the federal government the easement and lease for the navajo generating station expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for four corners expire in 2016 each of the leases contains an option to extend for an additional 25year period from the end of the existing lease term for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index the easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or extension of the easements may be imposed the ultimate cost of renewal of the navajo generating station and four corners leases and easements is uncertain as noted above under “portfolio resources – coal fueled generating facilities” the coal contracted for use in these plants is also located on indian reservations 

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation the four corners and navajo generating station plant leases provide navajo nation consent to certain of the rightsofway for transmission lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the rightsofway and for a like payment in any renewal period in addition a 1985 amendment to the leases provides a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rightsofway however some of our rightsofway are not covered by the leases or are granted by other indian tribes in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rightsofway certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway or that are typical for similar permits across nonindian lands however we are unaware of the underlying agreements andor specific circumstances surrounding these renewals the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is 

uncertain we are monitoring these rightsofway and easement issues and have initiated discussions with the navajo nation regarding them we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter 

environmental matters 

  epa environmental regulation 

  regional haze rules on april 22 1999 the epa announced final regional haze rules these regulations required states to submit state implementation plans sips by december 2007 to demonstrate “reasonable progress” towards achieving natural visibility conditions in certain “class i areas” including several on the colorado plateau sips are required to consider and potentially apply “best available retrofit technology” bart for certain older major stationary sources the rules allow nine western states and indian tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and schedule for the class i areas this alternate implementation plan is known as the annex rule 

on june 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air visibility rule which amends the 1999 regional haze rules by providing guidelines known as the bart guidelines for states to use in determining which facilities must install controls and the type of controls the facilities must use the epa also issued a revised annex rule on october 13 2006 to address a previous challenge and court remand of that rule 

adeq is currently undertaking a rulemaking process to amend its sip to reconcile it with the revised annex rule and to implement the clean air visibility rule requirements adeq’s regional haze sips were due to epa region 9 in december 2007 but are actually expected to be submitted during 2009 as part of the rulemaking process adeq is requiring certain sources in the state to conduct bart analyses cholla and west phoenix received letters from adeq asserting that the plants are potentially subject to bart and requesting that we either perform a bart analysis on each plant or provide information demonstrating that we are not subject to bart we completed a bart analysis for cholla and submitted our bart recommendations to adeq on february 4 2008 our recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that we believe constitutes bart once we receive adeq’s final determination as to what constitutes bart for cholla we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by adeq however in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities we are currently implementing portions of our recommended plan for cholla on a voluntary basis costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – capital expenditures” in item 7 

because we believed that adeq’s baseline modeling for west phoenix may have contained some errors we reperformed the baseline modeling using correct input and have determined that west phoenix is not subject to bart we submitted these findings for west phoenix to adeq and adeq has verbally informed us that west phoenix is not subject to bart 

in addition epa region 9 requested us to perform a bart analysis for four corners we completed the analysis and submitted it to the epa on january 30 2008 in december 2008 we provided additional data in response to a request from the epa our recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that we believe constitutes bart once we 

receive the epa’s final determination as to what constitutes bart for four corners we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by epa region 9 however in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities we will begin implementing initial portions of our recommended plan later this year for four corners on a voluntary basis costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – capital expenditures” in item 7 

while we continue to monitor this matter at the present time we cannot predict whether the agencies will agree with our bart recommendations or if the agencies disagree with our recommendations the nature of the bart controls the agencies may ultimately mandate and the resulting financial or operational impact 

  mercury on march 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air mercury rule camr to control mercury emissions from coalfired power plants this rule establishes performance standards limiting mercury emissions from coalfired power plants and establishes a two phased marketbased emissions trading program under the trading program the epa has assigned each state a mercury emissions “budget” and each state must submit to the epa a plan detailing how it will meet its “budget” 

in november 2006 adeq submitted a sip to the epa to implement the camr adeq’s sip generally incorporates the epa’s model capandtrade program but it includes additional requirements including the requirement to meet a 90 mercury removal control level or 00087 lbsgwh whichever is greater the requirement to obtain mercury allowances at a 21 ratio for any emissions that fall below the specified control level and the requirement beginning in 2013 to consider clean coal technologies as part of permitting any new generation 

on february 8 2008 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the camr and the epa rule that allowed for the creation of the camr and on march 14 2008 the court issued the mandate to vacate these rules on may 20 2008 the dc circuit denied the epa’s request to reconsider its decision on october 17 2008 the us solicitor general on behalf of the epa petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the dc circuit court of appeals’ vacatur of the camr in filing the petition the us contended among other things that the court of appeals’ decision “effectively divests epa of the discretion that congress conferred on the agency to consider alternative regulatory approaches to combating air pollution from power plants” unless and until this decision is overturned the law in effect prior to the adoption of the camr becomes the applicable law and requires the epa to develop an emission limit for mercury that represents the maximum achievable control technology it is expected to take the epa several years to establish its standard followed by a period of several years during which existing plants would implement any controls needed to comply with the standard 

the court’s ruling also invalidates camrbased portions of adeq’s mercury rule the trading provisions of the rule although the stateonly emission limits remain in effect on july 25 2008 the arizona utilities group comprised of aps arizona electric power cooperative salt river project tucson electric power company and tristate generation and transmission association filed with adeq a petition for reconsideration and repeal of the state mercury rule the petition asserts that adeq does not have statutory authority to administer and enforce the state mercury rule in light of the vacatur of the camr and the requirement that epa promulgate a maximum achievable control technology “mact” standard adeq granted the petition in part 

and agreed to begin rulemaking efforts to repeal those portions of adeq’s mercury rule that are no longer valid in light of the vacatur of the federal camr however adeq denied the petition with respect to certain compliance deadlines and unless the arizona utilities group reaches an agreement with adeq on revisions to the state mercury rule aps and others will have to comply with the 90 mercury removal or 00087 lbsgwh levels discussed above by 2013 on february 17 2009 aps signed a consent order with adeq under which aps will strive to achieve 50 mercury removal commencing in 2011 and will fully comply with the adeq mercury rule by 2016 rather than by 2013 as the rule currently prescribes 

while we continue to monitor this matter we cannot predict the final outcome of the petition to the supreme court additional actions by adeq resulting from the federal court’s decision or the arizona utilities group petition or the scope timing or impact of any alternate rules that may be enacted to address mercury emissions 

we have installed and continue to install certain of the equipment necessary to meet the current mercury standards however due to the us court of appeals decision described above we will monitor the type and timing of any necessary equipment installation the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next three years for such equipment are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – capital expenditures” in item 7 

  federal implementation plan in september 1999 the epa proposed fips to set air quality standards at certain power plants including four corners and the navajo generating station on september 12 2006 the epa proposed revised fips to establish air quality standards at both of these plants 

  four corners fip 

on april 30 2007 the epa adopted a source specific fip to set air quality standards at four corners the fip essentially federalizes the requirements contained in the new mexico state implementation plan which four corners has historically followed the fip also includes a requirement to maintain and enhance dust suppression methods on july 2 2007 aps filed a petition for review in the united states district court of appeals for the tenth circuit seeking revisions to the fip to clarify certain requirements and allow operational flexibility the sierra club intervened in this action on july 6 2007 the sierra club and other parties filed a petition for review with the same court challenging the fip’s compliance with the clean air act and we have intervened in their action in our lawsuit we challenge two key provisions of the fip a 20 opacity limit on certain fugitive dust emissions which the epa filed a motion to remand and vacate in early december 2007 and a 20 stack opacity limit on units 4 and 5 briefing in this case is now complete and oral arguments as requested by the epa were completed in may 2008 after briefing was completed the epa voluntarily moved to vacate the fugitive dust provisions of the fip the court has not yet ruled on that motion however in light of that motion aps asked for and the epa granted an administrative stay of the fugitive dust provisions and the navajo nation epa amended our four corners permit to specify that those requirements do not apply unless and until the court denies the epa’s motion although we cannot predict the outcome or the timing of these matters we do not believe that they will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  navajo generating station fip 

the proposed fip for the navajo generating station is still pending aps cannot currently predict the effect of this proposed fip on its financial position results of operations or cash flows or whether the proposed fip will be adopted in its current form 

  superfund superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time neither aps nor pinnacle west can accurately estimate the expenditures that may be required 

by letter dated april 25 2008 the epa informed aps that it may be a prp in the gila river indian reservation superfund site in maricopa county arizona aps along with three other electric utility companies owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a transmission line are located the property abuts the gila river indian community boundary and at one time may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place currently the epa is only seeking payment from aps and four other prps for past cleanuprelated costs involving contamination from the crop dusting based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the epa in its letter to aps we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  manufactured gas plant sites aps is currently investigating properties which it now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors that were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo generating station are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “portfolio resources – coal fueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the “navajo acts” the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo generating station on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo generating 

station the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo tribal council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the regulations fail to recognize that the navajo nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over four corners and the navajo generating station on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of the operating permit regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo generating station and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement “vca” to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act on march 21 2006 the epa determined that the navajo nation was eligible for “treatment as a state” for the purpose of entering into a supplemental delegation agreement with the epa to administer the clean air act title v part 71 federal permit program over four corners and the navajo generating station the epa entered into the supplemental delegation agreement with the navajo nation on the same day because the epa’s approval was consistent with the requirements of the vca aps sought dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court as well as the pending litigation in the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act and the courts have dismissed the claims accordingly the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions 

both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’ other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks 

confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’ groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights a number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation aps does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

climate change 

  legislative and regulatory initiatives in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions but such bills have not yet received sufficient congressional approval to become law however there is growing consensus that some form of regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions in 2007 the united states supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act the court held that the only way the epa can avoid regulating greenhouse gases is if it determines that the emissions do not contribute to climate change or if the epa provides a reasonable explanation for why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to regulate these emissions while this decision applies only to emissions from new motor vehicles if the epa determines that greenhouse gas emissions can reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare this determination will likely impact other clean air act programs as well and could potentially result in new regulatory requirements for our power plants 

in addition to federal legislative initiatives state specific initiatives may also impact our business while arizona has not yet enacted any state specific legislation regarding greenhouse gas emissions ab 32 is a california statute mandating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 in december 2008 the california air resources board issued a final scoping plan which is intended to form the basis of rules required under ab 32 on january 1 2012 the regulations based on the 2009 scoping plan will become effective we are monitoring this and other state legislative developments to evaluate whether and the extent to which any resulting statutes or rules in california or other states may affect our business including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our outofstate power plant participants to meet their obligations 

if any emission reduction legislation or regulations are enacted we will assess our compliance alternatives which may include replacement of existing equipment installation of additional pollution control equipment purchase of allowances curtailing certain operations or other actions although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation could be material we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our rates 

  regional initiative in 2007 six western states arizona california new mexico oregon utah and washington and two canadian provinces british columbia and manitoba entered into an accord the western climate initiative the “initiative” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and certain industries including utilities montana quebec and ontario have also joined the initiative in august 2007 the initiative participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 15 below 2005 levels by 2020 since may 2008 several draft documents have been issued for public comment we are reviewing the recommendations and requirements in these documents which currently provide only a general framework for the proposed program over the next year the initiative participants intend to develop detailed rules to more fully establish and define the program since details are not yet available such as the number of allowances each source may receive we are unable to quantify the potential financial and operational impacts on our business in addition we believe that the implementation of any such program in arizona would require legislative action as a result while we continue to monitor the progress and impact of the initiative at the present time we cannot predict what detailed form it will ultimately take whether it will be implemented or if it is implemented what impact it will have on our operations 

  company response to climate change initiatives we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns including renewable energy procurement and development promotion of programs and rates related to energy conservation renewable energy use and energy efficiency and implementation of an active technology innovation effort to evaluate potential emerging new technologies aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind geothermal solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources see “portfolio resources – alternative generation sources” above in january 2009 we submitted a resource plan report to the acc proposing our future plans for additional diverse resources see “portfolio resources – resource plan” above for information regarding the resource plan report which was designed in part to increase arizona’s commitment to nonfossil resources 

in addition we are currently developing a climate management report to comply with an acc order that directed aps to undertake a climate management plan carbon emission reduction study and commitment and action plan with public input and acc review we expect to complete the report in early 2009 

in january 2008 aps joined the climate registry as a founding reporter founding reporters are companies that voluntarily joined the nonprofit organization before may 2008 to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions in a common accurate and transparent manner consistent across industry sectors and borders pinnacle west has also reported and will continue to report greenhouse gas emissions in its annual corporate responsibility report which is available on our website  wwwpinnaclewestcom   in addition to emissions data the report provides information related to the company its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report

  aps is subject to comprehensive government regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that could have a material adverse impact on its business liquidity and results of operations 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business liquidity and results of operations the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and aps’ issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates while approved electric rates are intended to permit aps to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which are before or which may come before the acc decisions made by the acc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

aps is required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate aps’ business the ferc the nrc the epa and the acc regulate many aspects of our utility operations including siting and construction of facilities customer service and as noted in the preceding paragraph the rates that aps can charge customers we believe the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for aps’ existing operations and that aps’ business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved in early 2007 the nrc placed palo verde unit 3 in the “multiplerepetitive degraded cornerstone” column of the nrc’s action matrix “column 4” which has resulted in an enhanced nrc inspection regime including onsite indepth inspections of palo verde equipment and operations although only palo verde unit 3 is in nrc’s column 4 in order to adequately assess the need for improvements aps management has been conducting sitewide assessments of equipment and operations aps continues to cooperate fully with the nrc throughout this process the enhanced nrc inspection regime and aps’ ongoing commitment to the conservatively safe operation of palo verde could result in nrc action or an aps decision to shut down one or more units in the event of noncompliance with operating requirements or in light of other operational considerations 

  aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase its cost of operations impact its business plans or expose it to environmental liabilities 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid waste hazardous waste and coal combustion products which consist of bottom ash fly ash and air pollution control wastes these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other approvals if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations we cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

in addition we may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

we cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’ customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  concern over climate change could result in significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions or related litigation which may increase aps’ cost of operations 

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions in addition lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases including a lawsuit filed against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions but such bills have not received sufficient congressional approval to date to become law however there is growing consensus that some form of regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions in addition in 2007 the united states supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and as a result the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which we operate ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases any resulting limitations on generation facility co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coal fired facilities which constitute approximately 28 of our generation capacity if the epa determines that greenhouse gas emissions can reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare this determination may impact other clean air act programs and could potentially result in new regulatory requirements for our power plants which could also result in substantial additional costs excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could force aps and other similarlysituated electric power generators to close some coalfired facilities 

  there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

through aps we have an ownership interest in and operate on behalf of a group of owners palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime which could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved see the first risk factor above for a discussion of the enhanced nrc inspection regime currently in effect at palo verde and the related operational and regulatory implications in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and 

adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

the operation of palo verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed andor extended in december 2008 we applied for renewed operating licenses for all three palo verde units for 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses we do not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses however as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict 

  the operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power outages or reduced output which could materially affect our results of operations 

the operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business if aps’ facilities operate below expectations we may lose revenue or incur additional expenses including increased purchased power expenses 

  the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued easements and rightsofway which could have a significant impact on our business 

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods we are currently unable to predict the outcome of discussions with the appropriate indian tribes with respect to future renewal of these easements and rightsofway 

  deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’ service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

as a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers nonutility generators independent power producers and wholesale power marketers and brokers this increased competition could affect aps’ load forecasts plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues as a result of the changing regulatory environment and 

the relatively low barriers to entry we expect wholesale competition to increase which could adversely affect our business 

  changes in technology may adversely affect our business 

research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce power including fuel cells micro turbines clean coal and coal gasification photovoltaic solar cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’ generating facilities less competitive in addition advances in technology could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’ business 

  our results of operations can be adversely affected by weather conditions 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 

higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires forest fires could threaten our communities and electric transmission lines any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact our results of operations 

  our results of operations can be adversely affected by current economic conditions 

customer growth in aps’ service territory was 14 during 2008 customer growth averaged 3 a year for the three years 2006 through 2008 we currently expect customer growth to decline averaging about 1 per year for 2009 through 2011 due to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in arizona we currently expect our retail sales growth in 2009 to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate increases which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ generating plants have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings in addition the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area our inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries 

we conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries accordingly our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us 

the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our subsidiaries 

because we are structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities none of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  our inability to reduce capital expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation 

unexpected developments that may prevent us from reducing capital expenditures and other costs while maintaining reliability and customer service levels could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

we rely on access to shortterm money markets longerterm capital markets and the bank markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets however certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets such disruptions could include 

 

 

 

in addition the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons including unexpected periods of financial distress which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

 

recent subprime mortgage issues the collapse of the credit markets the weak housing market and the overall weakening of the economy have adversely affected the financial markets generally resulting in increased interest rates for corporate debt reduced access to the capital markets and actual or potential downgrades of bond insurers and banks among other negative matters in general the company and aps have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since september 2008 as a result existing bank lines have been used as a source of liquidity on which we depend in addition the interest rates on certain issues of aps’ pollution control bonds that are periodically reset through auction processes have recently increased these bonds are supported by bond insurance policies provided by ambac assurance corporation “ambac” and the interest rates on those bonds are directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer we do not expect however that any such increase will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

the 2007 and 2008 financial results of suncor our real estate subsidiary reflect the weak real estate market and current economic conditions suncor’s principal loan facility is secured primarily by an interest in land commercial properties land contracts and homes under construction the “secured revolver” at december 31 2008 suncor had borrowings of approximately 120 million under this facility the secured revolver matures on january 30 2010 in addition to the secured revolver at december 31 2008 suncor had approximately 68 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants the majority of this indebtedness is due in 2009 and suncor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities 

if suncor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of crossdefault provisions such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse impact on suncor’s business and its financial position the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness as a result the company does not believe that suncor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west’s cash flows or liquidity although any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements 

  a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s and aps’ securities limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could completely eliminate any possible future access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

our operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices and subject to specified risk parameters engaging in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

  changing interest rates and market conditions could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

changing interest rates affect interest paid on variablerate debt and interest earned on variablerate securities in our pension plan other postretirement benefit plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are also impacted by the discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates impact the discount rate and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income the pension plan other postretirement benefit and 

nuclear decommissioning trust funds also have risks associated with changing market values of fixed income and equity investments a significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices 

  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  our stock price could be affected because a substantial number of shares of our common stock could be available for sale in the future 

sales in the public market of a substantial number of shares of common stock could depress the market price of the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities because of the number of shares of our common stock that we are authorized to issue under our articles of incorporation a substantial number of shares of our common stock could be available for future sale 

  we may enter into credit and other agreements from time to time that restrict our ability to pay dividends 

payment of dividends on our common stock may be restricted by credit and other agreements entered into by us from time to time there are currently no material restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under any such agreement 

  certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 

these provisions which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium include the following 

 

in addition we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals including takeover proposals that could result in a premium over the market price of our common stock the shareholder rights plan will expire on march 26 2009 

while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors they could enable the board to hinder or 

frustrate a transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

  suncor’s business and financial performance could continue to be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting the real estate market 

suncor’s business and financial performance could continue to be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting the real estate market including 

 

as noted above see the risk factor relating to “financial market disruptions” at december 31 2008 suncor had borrowings of approximately 120 million under its principal loan facility the secured revolver the secured revolver matures on january 30 2010 in addition to the secured revolver at december 31 2008 suncor had approximately 68 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants the majority of this indebtedness is due in 2009 and suncor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities 

if suncor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of crossdefault provisions such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse impact on suncor’s business and its financial position the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness as a result the company does not believe that suncor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west’s cash flows or liquidity although any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements 

during 2008 the real estate market weakened significantly resulting in lower land and home sales and depressed real estate prices as a result in 2008 we recognized certain impairment charges if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen or as a result of a change in suncor’s strategy we may be required to record additional impairements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’ financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report 

overview 

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so 

while customer growth in aps’ service territory has been an important driver of our revenues and earnings it has significantly slowed reflecting recessionary economic conditions both nationally and in arizona customer growth averaged 3 a year for the three years 2006 through 2008 we currently expect customer growth and retail electricity sales growth excluding the effects of weather variations to average about 1 per year during 2009 through 2011 we currently project that our customer growth will begin to accelerate as the economy recovers 

the nearterm economic conditions are reflected in the recent volatility and disruption of the credit markets as discussed in detail under “liquidity and capital resources – pinnacle west consolidated” below despite these conditions pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company 

our cash flows and profitability are affected by the electricity rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates aps’ retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc aps’ capital expenditure requirements which are discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources – pinnacle west consolidated” are substantial because of increased costs related to environmental compliance and controls and system reliability as well as continuing though slowed customer growth in aps’ service territory 

aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health see “factors affecting our financial outlook” below on march 24 2008 aps filed a rate case with the acc which it updated on june 2 2008 requesting among other things an increase in retail rates to help defray rising infrastructure costs approval of an impact fee and approval of new conservation rates see note 3 for details regarding this rate case including the acc’s approval of an interim base rate surcharge pending the outcome of the case 

the 2007 and 2008 financial results of suncor our real estate subsidiary reflect the weak real estate market and current economic conditions which have adversely affected suncor’s ability to access capital suncor’s net loss in 2008 included a 53 million pretax real estate impairment charge if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen or as a result of a change in suncor’s strategy we may be required to record additional impairments see note 23 in addition to suncor’s secured revolver under which approximately 120 million in borrowings were outstanding at december 31 2008 suncor had approximately 68 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants the majority of this indebtedness except for the secured revolver is due in 2009 and suncor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities if suncor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of crossdefault provisions such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse impact on suncor’s business and its financial position the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness as a result the company does not believe that suncor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west’s cash flows or liquidity although any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements 

our other principal first tier subsidiaries el dorado and apses are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three years 

we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities in the delivery area we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction we plan to expand longterm energy resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customer base and to sustain reliability 

see “factors affecting our financial outlook” below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results 

pinnacle west consolidated – earnings contribution by business segment

the following table presents income from continuing operations for our regulated electricity and real estate segments and reconciles those amounts to net income in total for the years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 

 pinnacle west consolidated – results of operations 

2008 compared with 2007 

our consolidated net income decreased approximately 65 million to 242 million in 2008 from 307 million in 2007 the major factors that increased decreased our net income for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the prior year are summarized in the following table dollars in millions 

 

regulated electricity segment revenues 

regulated electricity segment revenues were 209 million higher for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

real estate segment revenues 

real estate segment revenues were 82 million lower for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

all other revenues 

all other revenues were 78 million lower for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of planned reductions of marketing and trading activities 

2007 compared with 2006 

our consolidated net income decreased approximately 20 million from 327 million for 2006 to 307 million for 2007 the major factors that increased decreased net income for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the prior year are summarized in the following table dollars in millions 

 

regulated electricity segment revenues 

regulated electricity segment revenues were 283 million higher for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

real estate segment revenues 

real estate segment revenues were 187 million lower for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

all other revenues 

other revenues were 13 million higher for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of increased sales by apses of energyrelated products and services 

liquidity and capital resources – pinnacle west consolidated 

cash flows 

the following table presents net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

  2008 compared with 2007 

the increase of approximately 156 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower current income taxes lower real estate investments resulting from the weak real estate market and increased retail revenue related to higher base fuel rates partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the decrease of approximately 58 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to a real estate commercial property sale in 2008 lower levels of capital expenditures see table and discussion below and increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in 2008 in aps’ line extension policy see note 3 partially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities 

the decrease of approximately 134 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the use of the proceeds from the sale of a real estate commercial property to pay down longterm debt in 2008 partially offset by higher levels of shortterm debt borrowings 

  2007 compared with 2006 

the increase of approximately 264 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in 2007 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the increase of approximately 304 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to the proceeds of 208 million received in 2006 from the 2005 sale of silverhawk and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures and capitalized interest see table and discussion below partially offset by higher cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investments 

the increase of approximately 77 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher levels of shortterm borrowings partially offset by a decrease in net new longterm debt issuances net of redemptions and refinancing 

  liquidity 

  capital expenditure requirements 

the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for 2006 2007 and 2008 and estimated capital expenditures net of contributions in aid of construction for the next three years 

capital expenditures dollars in millions 

 

 

 distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems partially offset by contributions in aid of construction in accordance with aps’ line extension policy 

generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear plants examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment environmental expenditures differ for each of the years 2009 2010 and 2011 with the lowest year estimated at approximately 25 million and the highest year estimated at approximately 80 million we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters which depending on their final outcome could require modification to our environmental expenditures see “business of arizona public service company – environmental matters – epa environmental regulation – regional haze rules” and “environmental matters – epa environmental regulation – mercury” in item 1 

in early 2008 we announced and began implementing a cost reduction effort that included the elimination of approximately 200 million of capital expenditures for the years 2008 – 2012 these capital expenditure reductions are reflected in the estimates provided above due primarily to our reduced customer growth outlook as well as the deferral of upgrades and other capital projects we have identified additional capital expenditure reductions of over 500 million at aps net of the 

change in amounts collected for projected line extensions over the years 2009 – 2011 these reductions are across all areas – distribution generation transmission and general plant and are reflected in the estimates provided above see “pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook – customer and sales growth” below for additional information on our growth outlook 

capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash andor external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  pinnacle west parent company 

our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our longterm debt the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

on january 21 2009 the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0525 per share of common stock payable on march 2 2009 to shareholders of record on february 2 2009 

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external debt and equity financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries primarily suncor for the years 2006 through 2008 total distributions from aps were 510 million and total distributions received from suncor were 15 million for 2008 cash distributions from aps were 170 million and there were no distributions from suncor an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and prohibits aps from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2008 aps’ common equity ratio as defined was approximately 54 

the credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning the week of september 15 2008 while pinnacle west’s and aps’ ability to issue commercial paper has been negatively impacted by the market stress they have both been able to access existing credit facilities ensuring adequate liquidity cash on hand is being invested in money market funds consisting of us treasury and government agency securities and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by us treasury and government agency securities 

at december 31 2008 pinnacle west’s outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was 175 million pinnacle west has a 300 million revolving credit facility that terminates in december 2010 credit commitments totaling approximately 17 million from lehman brothers are no longer available due to its september 2008 bankruptcy filing the remaining 283 million revolver is available to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper see discussion above or to be used as bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit of up to 94 million at december 31 2008 pinnacle west had outstanding 144 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility and approximately 7 million of letters of credit pinnacle west had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2008 in general the company and aps have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since september 2008 at december 31 2008 pinnacle west had remaining capacity available 

under its revolver of approximately 132 million and had cash and investments of approximately 6 million 

pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries irs regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation the assets in the plan are comprised of fixedincome equity and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions we contributed 35 million to our pension plan in 2008 on a cash funded basis which is based on internal revenue code regulations our preliminary estimate of the qualified plan’s funded status market value of assets to liabilities as of january 1 2009 is 986 the plan’s irs cash funded status was 943 as of january 1 2008 most of the increase from the prior year was due to gains in the longduration bonds and interest rate swaps that we utilized in 2008 to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan’s assets to that of the plan’s liabilities the required minimum contribution to our pension plan is estimated to be approximately 36 million in 2009 and approximately 25 million in 2010 the expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2009 is estimated to be approximately 15 million aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions aps’ share is approximately 96 of both plans 

see note 3 for information regarding pinnacle west’s approval from the acc regarding a potential equity infusion into aps of up to 400 million 

in may 2007 pinnacle west infused approximately 40 million of equity into aps consisting of proceeds of stock issuances in 2006 under pinnacle west’s investors advantage plan direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock plans 

  aps 

aps’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and mandatory redemptions of longterm debt aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary equity infusions from pinnacle west and external financings aps has historically paid its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 

aps’ outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was approximately 29 billion at december 31 2008 aps has two committed revolving credit facilities totaling 900 million of which 400 million terminates in december 2010 and 500 million terminates in september 2011 credit commitments totaling about 34 million from lehman brothers are no longer available due to its september 2008 bankruptcy filing the remaining 866 million is available either to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit up to 583 million at december 31 2008 aps had borrowings of approximately 522 million and no letters of credit under its revolving lines of credit aps had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2008 in general the company and aps have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since september 2008 at december 31 2008 aps had remaining capacity available under its revolvers of 344 million and had cash and investments of approximately 72 million 

the interest rates on eleven issues of aps’ pollution control bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately 343 million are reset every seven days through auction processes these bonds are supported by bond insurance policies provided by ambac and the interest rates on the bonds can be directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer certain bond insurers including ambac have had downgrades of their credit ratings downgrades of bond insurers result in downgrades of the insured bonds which increases the possibility of a “failed auction” and results in higher interest rates during the failed auction periods when auctions of aps bonds fail the aps bondholders receive the maximum 14 annual interest rate for the week of the failed auction for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 we had ninetynine failed auctions which represented about 17 of all of our auctions the average interest rate at december 31 2008 on the auction rate securities was 124 bond auctions continued to fail through midjanuary however since that time we have had only one failure the average interest rate at february 18 2009 on the auction rate securities was 57 we continue to closely monitor this market and if market and business conditions allow we are planning on refunding and reissuing these bonds during 2009 we do not expect however that our auction rate interest exposure will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

on september 11 2008 aps repurchased at par two series of pollution control bonds that had no credit enhancements the repurchase included 7 million of its 1996 series a coconino county pollution control bonds and 20 million of its 1999 series a coconino county pollution control bonds aps borrowed funds under its revolving lines of credit to repurchase the bonds as permitted under the bond indenture aps intends to keep the 27 million outstanding until we complete our planned refunding and reissuance of these bonds if market and business conditions allow in 2009 

although provisions in aps’ articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that aps may issue aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements on october 30 2007 the acc issued a financing order in which it approved aps’ request subject to specified parameters and procedures to increase a aps’ shortterm debt authorization from 7 of aps’ capitalization to i 7 of aps’ capitalization plus ii 500 million which is required to be used for purchases of natural gas and power and b aps’ longterm debt authorization from approximately 32 billion to 42 billion in light of the projected growth of aps and its customer base and the resulting projected financing needs this financing order expires december 31 2012 however all debt previously authorized and outstanding on december 31 2012 will remain authorized and valid obligations of aps 

  other financing matters – see note 3 for information regarding the psa approved by the acc although aps defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis aps’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and if necessary periodic psa adjustments 

see note s5 for information regarding an acc order permitting pinnacle west to infuse up to 400 million of equity into aps on or before december 31 2009 if pinnacle west deems it appropriate to do so to strengthen or maintain aps’ financial integrity 

see “cash flow hedges” in note 18 for information related to the change in our margin account 

  other subsidiaries 

  suncor – the weak real estate market and current economic conditions have adversely affected suncor’s financial results and its ability to access capital during the past three years 

suncor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings suncor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures during 2008 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years 

suncor’s principal loan facility the secured revolver is secured primarily by an interest in land commercial properties land contracts and homes under construction on february 19 2009 suncor and the secured revolver lenders extended the maturity date of the secured revolver to january 30 2010 classified as current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2008 suncor is required to repay amounts under the secured facility in order to reduce the lenders’ commitments to a balance of 100 million by december 31 2009 the secured revolver requires compliance with certain loan covenants pertaining to debt to net worth debt service liquidity cash flow coverage and restrictions on debt in addition to the secured revolver at december 31 2008 suncor had approximately 68 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants the majority of this indebtedness is due in 2009 and suncor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities 

if suncor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of crossdefault provisions such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse impact on suncor’s business and its financial position the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness as a result the company does not believe that suncor’s inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west’s cash flows or liquidity although any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements 

suncor entered into a secured construction loan on april 13 2007 in the amount of 60 million which was subsequently repaid in june 2008 

on july 31 2007 suncor borrowed 12 million under a new secured construction loan the loan matures on july 31 2009 and may be extended annually up to two years 

suncor’s total outstanding debt was approximately 188 million as of december 31 2008 including 120 million of debt classified as current maturities of longterm debt under revolving lines of credit totaling 150 million suncor’s longterm debt including current maturities was 183 million and total shortterm debt was 5 million at december 31 2008 see notes 5 and 6 suncor had cash and investments of approximately 27 million at december 31 2008 

  el dorado – el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 

  apses – apses expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 

  debt provisions 

pinnacle west’s and aps’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios certain of aps’ bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total 

consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2008 the ratio was approximately 51 for pinnacle west and 49 for aps the provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times the interest coverage was approximately 45 times under aps’ bank financing agreements as of december 31 2008 failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings 

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’ bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings 

see note 6 for further discussions 

  credit ratings 

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 18 2009 are shown below the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’ securities and serve to increase the cost of and limit access to capital it may also require substantial additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments natural gas transportation fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts 

 

 

   offbalance sheet arrangements 

in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and accordingly do not consolidate them see note 9 

aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur under certain circumstances for example the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had occurred as of december 31 2008 aps would have been required to assume approximately 174 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately 162 million 

  guarantees and letters of credit 

we have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries our parental guarantees for pinnacle west marketing  trading relate to commodity energy products as required by arizona law pinnacle west has also obtained a 10 million bond on behalf of aps in connection with the interim base rate surcharge approved by the acc in december 2008 see “2008 general rate case — interim rate surcharge” in note 3 our credit support instruments enabled apses to offer energyrelated products and commodity energy nonperformance or nonpayment under the original contract by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond no liability is currently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to pinnacle west’s current outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries at december 31 2008 we had no guarantees that were in default our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2008 dollars in millions 

 

 

 this table excludes 69 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows in uncertain 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates we had 795 million including 8 million related to the psa of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 

also included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2008 is a regulatory asset of 473 million in accordance with sfas no 158 for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

in addition we had 588 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 which primarily are related to removal costs see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2008 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2008 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2008 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2008 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

derivative accounting 

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we 

use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 

see “market risks – commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see “fair value measurements” below for additional information on valuation see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 

fair value measurements 

we apply fair value measurements to derivative instruments nuclear decommissioning trusts and cash equivalents we adopted sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” for our financial assets and liabilities on january 1 2008 sfas no 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date sfas no 157 establishes criteria to be considered when measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in accordance with sfas no 157 we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value and the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note 14 for further fair value measurement discussion note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 

our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities the fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets see note 12 for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts 

real estate investment impairments 

we had real estate investments of 415 million and home inventory of 51 million on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 we assess impairment of these assets in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for purposes of evaluating impairment we classify our real estate assets such as land under development land held for future development and commercial property as “held and used” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used may not be recoverable we compare the undiscounted cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows we adjust the asset to fair value and recognize an impairment charge the adjusted value becomes the new book value carrying amount for held and used assets we may have real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that are lower than their carrying amounts but are not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amounts 

real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 144 home inventories are reported at 

the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell fair value less cost to sell is evaluated each period to determine if it has changed losses and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount 

we determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk our impairment assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices future construction and land development costs future sales timing and discount rates the assumptions are specific to each project and may vary among projects the discount rates we used to determine fair values at december 31 2008 ranged from 17 to 27 due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process with regard to impairments it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen or as a result of a change in suncor’s strategy we may be required to record additional impairments 

other accounting matters 

see note 14 for a discussion of sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which we adopted effective january 1 2008 and the following related accounting guidance 

 

see notes 18 and s3 for discussions of fasb staff position no fin 391 “amendment of fasb interpretation no 39 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts” fin 391 which we adopted january 1 2008 

sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” was effective for us on january 1 2008 this guidance provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or liabilities therefore sfas no 159 did not have an impact on our financial statements 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” this guidance requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities the statement is effective for us on january 1 2009 it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in december 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 132r1 “employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” this guidance requires enhanced employer disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan the guidance is effective for us on december 31 2009 we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements

  general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states for the years 2006 through 2008 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 91 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer growth variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer electricity rates and tariffs and the recovery of psa deferrals offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps’ retail customers through the psa these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including demand and prices competitive retail sales of energy and energyrelated products and services are made by apses in certain western states that have opened to competition 

  rate proceedings our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates aps’ retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc aps’ capital expenditure requirements which are discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources – pinnacle west consolidated” are substantial because of environmental compliance and controls system reliability and continuing though slowed customer growth in aps’ service territory aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health on march 24 2008 aps filed a rate case with the acc which it updated on june 2 2008 requesting among other things an increase in retail rates to help defray rising infrastructure costs approval of an impact fee and approval of new conservation rates see note 3 for details regarding this rate case including the acc’s approval of an interim base rate surcharge pending the outcome of the case 

  fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas our hedging program for managing such costs and since april 1 2005 psa deferrals and the amortization thereof see note 3 for information regarding the psa aps’ recovery of psa deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and if necessary periodic psa adjustments 

  customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers and sales to them customer growth in aps’ service territory was 14 during 2008 customer growth averaged 3 a year for the three years 2006 through 2008 we currently expect customer growth to decline averaging about 1 per year for 2009 through 2011 due to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in arizona for the three years 2006 through 2008 aps’ actual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours grew at an average annual rate of 29 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations such retail sales growth averaged 29 a year we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will grow 1 on average per year during 2009 through 2011 excluding the effects of weather variations we currently expect our retail sales growth in 2009 to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate increases see note 3 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  weather in forecasting retail sales growth we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  wholesale market our marketing and trading activities focus primarily on managing aps’ risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand our marketing and trading activities include subject to specified parameters marketing hedging and trading in electricity and fuels see “formula transmission tariff” in note 3 for information regarding aps’ recent filing with the ferc requesting a change to the formula rate 

other factors affecting financial results 

  operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 

  depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 

  property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 78 of the assessed value for 2008 83 of the assessed value for 2007 and 89 of assessed value for 2006 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant including new generation transmission and distribution facilities and as we improve our existing facilities see “capital expenditures” above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 

  interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 6 the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities and internally generated cash flow capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

  climate change recent concern over climate change could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades the timing and type of compliance measures and related costs are impacted by current and future regulatory and legislative actions which we are closely monitoring see “business of arizona public service company – climate change” in item 1 for more information regarding climate change initiatives 

  retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail electric service providers providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will reenter aps’ service territory 

  subsidiaries suncor’s net loss was approximately 26 million in 2008 suncor’s net loss in 2008 included a 53 million pretax real estate impairment charge suncor’s net income was approximately 24 million in 2007 and 61 million in 2006 see note 23 for further discussion this estimate reflects continuation of the slowdown in the western united states real estate markets see “liquidity and capital resources – other subsidiaries – suncor” and note 6 for a discussion of suncor’s longterm debt liquidity and capital requirements 

the historical results of apses and el dorado are not indicative of future performance 

  general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” above for further information on such factors which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 

market risks

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas our energy risk management committee consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities

cash flows 

the following table presents aps’ net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

  2008 compared with 2007 

the increase of approximately 19 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower current income taxes and increased retail revenue related to higher base fuel rates partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the decrease of approximately 2 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures see table and discussion above and increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in 2008 in our line extension policy see note 3 substantially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities 

the increase of approximately 28 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher levels of shortterm borrowings partially offset by decreased equity infusions from pinnacle west and the repurchase of pollution control bonds see note 6 

  2007 compared with 2006 

the increase of approximately 372 million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in 2007 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices 

the increase of approximately 167 million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to an increase in cash used for capital expenditures see table and discussion above and 

increased allowance for borrowed funds used during construction partially offset by higher cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities 

the decrease of approximately 266 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to a decrease in net new longterm debt issuances net of redemptions and refinancing and a decrease in equity infusions from pinnacle west partially offset by higher levels of shortterm borrowings to fund daytoday operations and liquidity needs

regulation and competition 

retail 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer or encumbrance of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet their own energy requirements 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’ retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers in 2000 an arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision to date the acc has taken no action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision as a result at present only limited electric retail competition exists in arizona and only with certain entities not regulated by the acc however the acc has scheduled a hearing during the first quarter of 2008 to consider the new application of a competitive electric service provider for authority to provide competitive electric services certain intervenors in that proceeding have requested the acc to dismiss the application because of among other reasons the legal uncertainties 

associated with the rules as described above the acc has taken this motion to dismiss under advisement aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory

preliminary work in support of the nrc’s enhanced inspection regime took place throughout the summer of 2007 on june 21 2007 the nrc issued an initial confirmatory action letter confirming aps’ commitments regarding specific actions aps will take to improve palo verde’s performance from october 1 2007 through november 2 2007 a team of nrc inspectors performed onsite indepth inspections of palo verde’s equipment and operations the nrc’s inspection results were presented at a public meeting on december 19 2007 and documented in an nrc letter to aps dated february 1 2008 the “inspection report” the inspection report indicated that the facility is being operated safely but also identified certain performance deficiencies on december 31 2007 aps submitted its improvement plan to the nrc which addresses issues identified by aps’ management during its sitewide assessments of equipment and operations that occurred during 2007 the nrc reviewed the adequacy of this improvement plan and issued a revised confirmatory action letter on february 15 2008 that outlines the actions aps must take in order for the nrc to return the palo verde site to the nrc’s routine inspection and assessment process this revised confirmatory action letter was anticipated as part of the nrc’s inspection procedure and a substantial majority of the actions required therein were contained in aps’ improvement plan in march 2008 aps intends to submit to the nrc a revision to its improvement plan to address issues raised by the nrc in its inspection report the nrc will continue to provide increased oversight at palo verde until the facility demonstrates sustained performance improvement aps will continue cooperating fully with the nrc throughout this process 

  nuclear decommissioning costs – the nrc rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs through costofservice rates or through a “nonbypassable charge” the “nonbypassable systems benefits” charge is the charge that the acc has approved for aps’ recovery of certain types of costs including costs for low income programs demand side management consumer education environmental renewables etc “nonbypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider” other than aps the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s aps electric bill 

other mechanisms are prescribed including prepayment if the requirements for exclusive reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’ acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable system benefits charge which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism see note 12 for additional information about aps’ nuclear decommissioning costs 

  palo verde liability and insurance matters – see “palo verde nuclear generating station” in note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

  alternative generation sources 

in connection with its ongoing resource planning efforts aps continues to focus on increasing the percentage of its energy that is produced by renewable resources on november 1 2006 the acc approved the arizona renewable energy standard and tariff the “renewable energy standard” under the renewable energy standard covered utilities like aps must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from renewable resources including solar wind biomass biogas and geothermal technologies the renewable energy requirement increases from 15 in 2007 to 15 in 2025 in addition an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed resources generally speaking smallscale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties to increase system reliability the distributed resource requirement increases from 5 of the overall renewable energy requirement in 2007 to 30 in 2012 and subsequent years aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind from new mexico geothermal from california and utah and solar and biomass in arizona which collectively will generate over 120 mw of renewable energy for our customers 

on february 8 2008 aps entered into a renewable energy purchase and sale agreement under which aps agreed to purchase the energy and related renewable energy credits from a solar power plant for a period of thirty years after the plant begins commercial operation the plant which will have a nameplate rating of 280 mw and a projected annual output of 900000 mwh will be located near gila bend arizona about 70 miles southwest of phoenix arizona the agreement is subject to various conditions including acc approval if these conditions are met commercial operation is expected during 2011 

aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio both to ensure its compliance with the renewable energy standard and to meet the needs of its customer base 

  purchased power agreements 

in addition to its own available generating capacity aps purchases electricity under various arrangements aps’ purchased power capacity under longterm contracts as of december 31 2007 is summarized in the table below and does not include the recentlyexecuted solar agreement described under “alternative generation sources” aps also purchases power through shortterm markets to supplement its longterm resources and hedge its energy requirements 

 

 

 aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability aps remains committed to seeking proposals from the competitive wholesale market for filling its future resource needs including renewable resource capacity 

  reserve margin 

aps’ 2007 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on august 13 2007 at 7545100 kw compared with the 2006 peak of 7652000 kw recorded on july 21 2006 taking into account additional capacity then available to aps under longterm purchased power contracts as well as aps generating capacity aps had capacity of 6783000 kw to meet system demand on august 13 2007 for an installed reserve margin of negative 113 the power actually available to 

aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages and technical problems the available capacity from sources actually operable at the time of the 2007 peak amounted to 5839000 kw for a margin of a negative 335 firm purchases totaling 3484000 kw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unitcontingent purchases were in place at the time of the peak ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement with an actual reserve margin of 101 

transmission and distribution facilities 

aps’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5759 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 45 miles of underground lines 5535 miles of which are located in arizona aps’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 12471 miles of overhead lines and approximately 16210 miles of underground primary cable all of which are located in arizona aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’ jointlyowned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 

 

plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands 

the navajo generating station and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under easements from the federal government the easement and lease for the navajo generating station expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for four corners expire in 2016 each of the leases contains an option to extend for an additional 25year period from the end of the existing lease term for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index the easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or extension of the easements may be imposed the ultimate cost of renewal of the navajo generating station and four corners leases and easements is uncertain as noted above under “portfolio resources — coal fueled generating facilities” the coal contracted for use in these plants is also located on indian reservations 

certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rightsofway that are effective for specified periods some of these rightsofway have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes other rights expire at various times in the future and will have to be acted on for renewal by the applicable tribe at that time the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation the four corners and navajo generating station plant leases provide navajo nation consent to certain of the rightsofway for transmission lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the 

rightsofway and for a like payment in any renewal period in addition a 1985 amendment to the leases provides a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rightsofway however some of our rightsofway are not covered by the leases or are granted by other indian tribes in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rightsofway certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rightsofway or that are typical for similar permits across nonindian lands however we are unaware of the underlying agreements andor specific circumstances surrounding these renewals the ultimate cost of renewal of the rightsofway for our transmission lines is uncertain we are monitoring these rightsofway and easement issues and are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter 

construction program 

during the years 2005 through 2007 aps incurred approximately 24 billion in capital expenditures aps’ capital expenditures for the years 2008 through 2010 are expected to be primarily for expanding transmission and distribution capabilities to meet growing customer needs for upgrading existing utility property and for environmental purposes aps’ capital expenditures were approximately 900 million in 2007 aps’ capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental control facilities for the years 2008 through 2010 have been estimated as follows dollars in millions 

 

the above amounts do not include any impacts from the recent changes in the line extension policy see note 3 in addition the amounts exclude capitalized interest costs and include capitalized property taxes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately 90 million to 120 million per year are also included as part of our planning and cost control process aps conducts a continuing review of its construction program 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 for additional information about aps’ construction program 

environmental matters 

  epa environmental regulation 

  regional haze rules on april 22 1999 the epa announced final regional haze rules these regulations required states to submit state implementation plans sips by december 2007 to demonstrate “reasonable progress” towards achieving natural visibility conditions in certain “class i areas” including several on the colorado plateau sips are required to consider and potentially apply “best available retrofit technology” bart for certain older major stationary sources the 

rules allow nine western states and indian tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and schedule for the class i areas this alternate implementation plan is known as the annex rule 

on june 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air visibility rule which amends the 1999 regional haze rules by providing guidelines known as the bart guidelines for states to use in determining which facilities must install controls and the type of controls the facilities must use the epa also issued a revised annex rule on october 13 2006 to address a previous challenge and court remand of that rule 

adeq is currently undertaking a rulemaking process to amend its sip to reconcile it with the revised annex rule and to implement the clean air visibility rule requirements adeq’s regional haze sips were due to epa region 9 in december 2007 but are actually expected to be submitted during 2008 as part of the rulemaking process adeq is requiring certain sources in the state to conduct bart analyses cholla and west phoenix received letters from adeq asserting that the plants are potentially subject to bart and requesting that we either perform a bart analysis on each plant or provide information demonstrating that we are not subject to bart we recently completed a bart analysis for cholla and submitted our bart recommendations to adeq on february 4 2008 adeq will now review our submission and determine what constitutes bart for cholla our recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that we believe constitutes bart once we receive adeq’s final determination we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by adeq however in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities we are currently implementing our recommended plan for cholla on a voluntary basis costs related to the implementation of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – capital expenditures” in item 7 

because we believed that adeq’s baseline modeling for west phoenix may have contained some errors we reperformed the baseline modeling using correct input and have determined that west phoenix is not subject to bart we submitted these findings for west phoenix to adeq and adeq has verbally informed us that west phoenix is not subject to bart 

in addition epa region 9 requested us to perform a bart analysis for four corners we recently completed the analysis and submitted it to the epa on january 30 2008 the epa will now review our submission and determine what constitutes bart for four corners our recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that we believe constitutes bart once we receive the epa’s final determination we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by epa region 9 until the epa makes a final determination on this matter we cannot accurately estimate the expenditures that may be required as a result our current environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – capital expenditures” in item 7 do not include amounts for four corners bart expenditures 

while we continue to monitor this matter at the present time we cannot predict whether the agencies will agree with our bart recommendations or if the agencies disagree with our recommendations the nature of the bart controls the agencies may ultimately mandate and the resulting financial or operational impact 

  mercury on march 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air mercury rule camr to control mercury emissions from coalfired power plants this rule establishes performance standards 

limiting mercury emissions from coalfired power plants and establishes a two phased marketbased emissions trading program under the trading program the epa has assigned each state a mercury emissions “budget” and each state must submit to the epa a plan detailing how it will meet its “budget” in the first phase of the program beginning in 2010 mercury emissions from all coalfired power plants in the country will be reduced from a total of 48 tons per year to 38 tons in 2018 those emissions will be further reduced to 15 tons 

in november 2006 adeq submitted a sip to the epa to implement the camr adeq’s sip generally incorporates the epa’s model capandtrade program but it includes additional requirements including the requirement to meet a 90 mercury removal control level or 00087 lbsgwh whichever is greater the requirement to obtain mercury allowances at a 21 ratio for any emissions that fall below the specified control level and the requirement beginning in 2013 to consider clean coal technologies as part of permitting any new generation 

on february 8 2008 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the camr and the epa rule that allowed for the creation of the camr while we continue to monitor this matter we cannot predict the timing of the court’s issuance of a mandate to vacate the rules the response of adeq or the scope timing or impact of any alternate rules that may be proposed to address mercury emissions 

we have installed and may continue to install certain of the equipment necessary to meet these mercury standards however due to the recent us court of appeals decision we will monitor the type and timing of any necessary equipment installation the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next three years for such equipment are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – capital expenditures” in item 7 

  federal implementation plan in september 1999 the epa proposed fips to set air quality standards at certain power plants including four corners and the navajo generating station on september 12 2006 the epa proposed revised fips to establish air quality standards at both of these plants 

  four corners fip 

on april 30 2007 the epa adopted a source specific fip to set air quality standards at four corners the fip essentially federalizes the requirements contained in the new mexico state implementation plan which four corners has historically followed the fip also includes a requirement to maintain and enhance dust suppression methods on july 2 2007 aps filed a petition for review in the united states district court of appeals for the tenth circuit seeking revisions to the fip to clarify certain requirements and allow operational flexibility the sierra club has intervened in this action on july 6 2007 the sierra club and other parties filed a petition for review with the same court challenging the fip’s compliance with the clean air act and we have intervened in their action in our lawsuit we challenge two key provisions of the fip a 20 opacity limit on certain fugitive dust emissions which the epa filed a motion to remand and vacate in early december 2007 and a 20 stack opacity limit on units 4 and 5 briefing in this case is now complete and the court is next expected to determine whether to hold oral arguments on the matter as requested by the epa although we cannot predict the outcome or the timing of these matters we do not believe that they will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  navajo generating station fip 

the proposed fip for the navajo generating station is still pending aps cannot currently predict the effect of this proposed fip on its financial position results of operations or cash flows or whether the proposed fip will be adopted in its current form 

  superfund superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized at the present time neither aps nor pinnacle west can accurately estimate the expenditures that may be required 

  manufactured gas plant sites aps is currently investigating properties which it now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors that were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo generating station are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation see “portfolio resources – coal fueled generating facilities” above for additional information regarding these plants 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the navajo acts the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo generating station on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo generating station the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo tribal council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the regulations fail to recognize that the navajo nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over four corners and the navajo generating station on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of the operating permit regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo generating station and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement “vca” to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act on march 21 2006 the epa determined that the navajo nation was eligible for “treatment as a state” for the purpose of entering into a supplemental delegation agreement with the epa to administer the clean air act title v part 71 federal permit program over four corners and the navajo generating station the epa entered into the supplemental delegation agreement with the navajo nation on the same day because the epa’s approval was consistent with the requirements of the vca aps sought dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court as well as the pending litigation in the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act and the courts have dismissed the claims accordingly the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

climate change 

in 2007 six western states arizona california new mexico oregon utah and washington and two canadian provinces british columbia and manitoba entered into an accord the western climate initiative the “initiative” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and certain industries including utilities in august 2007 the initiative participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 15 below 2005 levels by 2020 by august 2008 the initiative participants intend to develop a plan for implementation of this goal any such implementation would require independent action by each individual state’s or province’s legislature or governor to adopt a version of the plan while we continue to monitor the impact of the initiative at the present time we cannot predict what form it will ultimately take whether it will be implemented or if it is implemented what impact it will have on our operations 

we are currently developing a climate management report to comply with an acc order in which the acc directed aps to undertake a climate management plan carbon emission reduction study and commitment and action plan with public input and acc review we expect to complete the report in 2008 

in january 2008 aps joined the climate registry as a founding reporter founding reporters are companies that voluntarily join the nonprofit organization before may 2008 to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions in a common accurate and transparent manner consistent across industry sectors and borders pinnacle west also makes available on its website  wwwpinnaclewestcom  its annual corporate responsibility report which provides information related to the company its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance the information on pinnacle west’s website including the corporate responsibility report is not incorporated by reference into this report 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions 

both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve 

aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’ other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court denied the petition in may 2007 and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’ groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and therefore is potentially at issue in the case aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights a number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation neither aps nor pinnacle west expects that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on future operations of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

federal energy legislation 

on august 8 2005 the president signed the energy policy act of 2005 into law the act includes a wide range of provisions addressing many aspects of the energy industry specifically with respect to the electric utility industry the act includes provisions that among other things repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 through enactment of the public utility holding company act of 2005 effective as of february 8 2006 creates incentives for the construction of transmission infrastructure eliminates the statutory restrictions on ownership of qualifying facilities by electric utilities establishes civil penalty authority over electric utilities and expands the authority of the ferc to include overseeing the reliability of the bulk power system while we continue to monitor the impact of this new federal legislation we cannot predict the impact of this act on our operations at this time

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  aps is subject to comprehensive government regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business and results of operations the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and aps’ issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates while approved electric rates are intended to permit aps to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which are before or which may come before the acc 

aps is required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate aps’ business the ferc the nrc the epa and the acc regulate many aspects of our utility operations including siting and construction of facilities customer service and as noted in the preceding paragraph the rates that aps can charge customers we believe the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for aps’ existing operations and that aps’ business is 

conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or both depending upon the nrc’s assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved in early 2007 the nrc placed palo verde unit 3 in the “multiplerepetitive degraded cornerstone” column of the nrc’s action matrix “column 4” which has resulted in an enhanced nrc inspection regime including onsite indepth inspections of palo verde equipment and operations although only palo verde unit 3 is in nrc’s column 4 in order to adequately assess the need for improvements aps management has been conducting sitewide assessments of equipment and operations aps continues to cooperate fully with the nrc throughout this process the enhanced nrc inspection regime and aps’ ongoing commitment to the conservatively safe operation of palo verde could result in nrc action or an aps decision to shut down one or more units in the event of noncompliance with operating requirements or in light of other operational considerations 

  aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase its cost of operations impact its business plans or expose it to environmental liabilities 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid waste and hazardous waste these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other approvals if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations we cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

in addition we may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

we cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’ customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  concern over climate change could result in significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions or related litigation which may increase aps’ cost of operations 

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co 2  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions in addition lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gasses including a recent lawsuit filed against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change in the past several years the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions but such bills have not received sufficient congressional approval to date to become law however there is growing consensus that some form of regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which we operate ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases any resulting limitations on generation facility co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coal fired facilities including ours 

  there are inherent risks in the operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

through aps we have an ownership interest in and operate on behalf of a group of owners palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime which could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved see the first risk factor above for a discussion of the enhanced nrc inspection regime currently in effect at palo verde and the related operational and regulatory implications in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

the operation of palo verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed andor extended we do not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses however as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict 

  the operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power outages or reduced output which could materially affect our results of operations 

the operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business if aps’ facilities operate below expectations we may lose revenue or incur additional expenses 

  deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and our financial results 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’ service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

as a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers nonutility generators independent power producers and wholesale power marketers and brokers this increased competition could affect aps’ load forecasts plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues as a result of the changing regulatory environment and the relatively low barriers to entry we expect wholesale competition to increase 

  changes in technology may adversely affect our business 

research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce power including fuel cells micro turbines clean coal and coal gasification photovoltaic solar cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’ generating facilities less competitive in addition advances in technology could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’ business 

  our results of operations can be adversely affected by weather conditions 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 

  our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries 

we conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries accordingly our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us 

the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our subsidiaries 

because we are structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities none of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit markets which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 

we rely on access to shortterm money markets longerterm capital markets and the bank markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings however certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets such disruptions could include 

 

 

 

changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

 

recent subprime mortgage issues have adversely affected the overall financial markets generally resulting in increased interest rates reduced access to the capital markets and actual or potential downgrades of bond insurers among other negative matters the interest rates on certain issues of aps’ pollution control bonds are periodically reset through auction processes these bonds are supported by bond insurance policies provided by ambac and the interest rates on those bonds are directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer accordingly interest rates on these bonds have recently increased we do not expect however that any such increase will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could limit our access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business and changing interest rates and market conditions could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

our operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices and subject to specified risk parameters engaging in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions allowances we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity 

derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default resulting in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

changing interest rates affect interest paid on variablerate debt and interest earned on variablerate securities in our pension plan other postretirement benefit plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are also impacted by the discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates impact the discount rate and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income the pension plan other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning trust funds also have risks associated with changing market values of fixed income and equity investments a significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices 

  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  we may enter into credit and other agreements from time to time that restrict our ability to pay dividends 

payment of dividends on our common stock may be restricted by credit and other agreements entered into by us from time to time there are currently no material restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under any such agreement 

  suncor’s business and financial performance could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting the real estate market 

suncor’s business and financial performance could continue to be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting the real estate market including downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions the potential overvaluation of land and new homes which could result in an economic down cycle for the homebuilding industry future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home which could prevent potential customers from buying homes in suncor’s developments competition for homebuyers or commercial customers or partners which could reduce suncor’s profitability supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials which could increase costs and delay deliveries government regulations which could increase the cost and limit the availability of suncor’s development homebuilding and commercial projects and inflation which could result in increased costs that suncor may not be able to recoup if demand declines

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and aps’ financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report 

overview 

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so customer growth in aps’ service territory is above the national average and remains an important driver of our revenues and earnings 

our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates aps’ retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc aps’ capital expenditure requirements which are discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources” are substantial because of customer growth in aps’ service territory and inflationary impacts on the capital budget highlighting aps’ need for the timely recovery through rates of these and other expenditures on june 28 2007 the acc issued an order in a general rate case granting aps retail base rate increases the acc rate case decision and other retail and wholesale rate matters are discussed in note 3 

suncor our real estate development subsidiary has been an important source of earnings in recent years although suncor’s earnings in 2007 and expected earnings in 2008 reflect a slowdown in the western united states real estate markets see discussion below in “pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook – subsidiaries” our subsidiary apses provides energyrelated products and services and competitive commodityrelated energy services to commercial and industrial retail customers in the western united states recently apses has deemphasized its commodityrelated energy services el dorado our investment subsidiary owns minority interests in several energyrelated investments and arizona communitybased ventures 

we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities in the delivery area we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction we plan to expand longterm energy resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability 

see “pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook” below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results

  capital expenditure requirements 

the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for 2005 2006 and 2007 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 

capital expenditures dollars in millions 

 

 

 distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems in addition these amounts do not include any impacts from the recent changes in the line extension policy see note 3 major transmission projects are driven by regional customer growth 

generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear plants examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment installation of new steam generators in palo verde unit 3 was completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 at an approximate cost of 70 million aps’ share which completed the steam generator replacement program for all three units environmental expenditures are estimated at approximately 70 million to 120 million per year for 2008 2009 and 2010 we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters which depending on their final outcome could require additional environmental expenditures see “business of arizona public service company – environmental matters – regional haze rules” in item 1 generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately 90 million to 120 million per year for 2008 2009 and 2010 

capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash andor external financings which may include issuances of longterm debt and pinnacle west common stock 

  pinnacle west parent company 

our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our longterm debt the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

on january 23 2008 the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0525 per share of common stock payable on march 3 2008 to shareholders of record on february 1 2008 

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external debt and equity financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries primarily suncor for the years 2005 through 2007 total dividends from aps were 510 million and total distributions from suncor were 70 million for 2007 cash contributions from aps were 170 million and distributions from suncor were 10 million an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and prohibits aps from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2007 aps’ common equity ratio as defined was approximately 54 

at december 31 2007 pinnacle west’s outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was 175 million pinnacle west has a 300 million revolving credit facility that terminates in december 2010 this line of credit is available to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit at december 31 2007 pinnacle west had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving line of credit at december 31 2007 we had 115 million of commercial paper outstanding 

pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries irs regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation the assets in the plan are comprised of fixedincome equity and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions we contributed approximately 52 million in 2007 the contribution to our pension plan in 2008 is estimated to be approximately 50 million the expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2008 is estimated to be approximately 20 million aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions aps’ share is approximately 96 of both plans 

  significant financing activities – 2007 on january 4 2007 the ferc issued an order permitting pinnacle west to transfer its marketbased rate tariff and wholesale power sales agreements to a newlycreated pinnacle west subsidiary pinnacle west marketing  trading pinnacle west completed the transfer on february 1 2007 which resulted in pinnacle west no longer being a public utility under the federal power act as a result pinnacle west is no longer subject to ferc jurisdiction in connection with its issuance of securities or its incurrence of longterm debt

  aps 

aps’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of longterm debt aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations equity infusions from pinnacle west and to the extent necessary external financings aps has historically paid its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west as noted above in may 2007 pinnacle west infused approximately 40 million of equity into aps 

aps’ outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was approximately 29 billion at december 31 2007 aps has two committed lines of credit totaling 900 million that are available either to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit the 400 million line terminates in december 2010 and the 500 million line terminates in september 2011 at december 31 2007 aps had borrowings of 218 million under its revolving line of credit the amount drawn was used for general corporate purposes 

  significant financing activities –2007 although provisions in aps’ articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that aps may issue aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements on october 30 2007 the acc issued a financing order in which it approved aps’ request subject to specified parameters and procedures to increase a aps’ shortterm debt authorization from 7 of aps’ capitalization to i 7 of aps’ capitalization plus ii 500 million and b aps’ longterm debt authorization from approximately 32 billion to 42 billion in light of the projected growth of aps and its customer base and the resulting projected financing needs 

  significant financing activities –2006 on august 3 2006 aps issued 400 million of debt as follows 250 million of its 625 notes due 2016 and 150 million of its 6875 notes due 2036 a portion of the proceeds was used to pay at maturity approximately 84 million of aps’

during the past three years suncor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings suncor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures during 2007 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years suncor expects to fund its future capital requirements with cash from operations and external financings 

suncor entered into a secured construction loan on april 13 2007 in the amount of 60 million of which 48 million was outstanding at december 31 2007 the loan matures on april 19 2009 and may be extended one year if certain conditions are met 

on july 31 2007 suncor borrowed 12 million under a new secured construction loan the loan matures on july 31 2009 and may be extended annually up to two years 

suncor’s total outstanding debt was approximately 246 million as of december 31 2007 including 94 million of debt classified as current maturities of longterm debt under revolving lines of credit totaling 170 million suncor’s longterm debt including current maturities was 238 million and total shortterm debt was 8 million at december 31 2007 see note 6 

el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 

apses expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 

  debt provisions 

pinnacle west’s and aps’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios certain of aps’ bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2007 the ratio was approximately 50 for pinnacle west and 47 for aps the provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps the interest coverage was approximately 47 times under aps’ bank financing agreements as of december 31 2007 failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings 

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’ bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings 

see note 6 for further discussions 

  credit ratings 

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 25 2008 are shown below the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’ securities and serve to increase the cost of and access to capital it may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments natural gas transportation fuel supply and other energyrelated contracts 

 

 

   offbalance sheet arrangements 

in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and accordingly do not consolidate them see note 9 

aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur under certain circumstances for example the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had occurred as of december 31 2007 aps would have been required to assume approximately 194 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately 170 million 

  guarantees and letters of credit 

we have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries our parental guarantees for pinnacle west marketing  trading and aps relate to commodity energy products our credit support instruments enable apses to offer energyrelated products and commodity energy nonperformance or nonpayment under the original contract by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond no liability is currently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to pinnacle west’s current outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates we had 625 million including 111 million related to the psa of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 

also included in the balance of regulatory assets at december 31 2007 is a regulatory asset of 338 million in accordance with sfas no 158 for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 

in addition we had 643 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 which primarily are related to removal costs see notes 1 and 3 for more information 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2007 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2007 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2007 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2007 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

derivative accounting 

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we 

use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 

the fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable in some cases we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions see “market risks – commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 

other accounting matters 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement is effective for us on january 1 2008 we are currently evaluating this new guidance but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas no 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value sfas no 159 is effective for us on january 1 2008 we are currently evaluating this new guidance but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in april 2007 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fin 391 “amendment of fasb interpretation no 39 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts” fsp fin 391 under fsp fin 391 a reporting entity is permitted to offset the fair value amounts recognized for cash collateral paid or cash collateral received against the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement this new guidance is effective for us on january 1 2008 with early application permitted we are currently evaluating the impacts of fsp fin 391 on our balance sheet we do not expect the guidance to have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

see note 4 for a discussion of fin 48 on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which we adopted january 1 2007 

pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook 

factors affecting operating revenues fuel and purchased power costs 

  general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states for the years 2005 through 2007 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 84 of 

our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer growth variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer electricity rates and tariffs and the recovery of psa deferrals offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps’ retail customers through the psa these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including demand and prices competitive retail sales of energy and energyrelated products and services are made by apses in certain western states that have opened to competition 

  rate proceedings our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates aps’ retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc aps’ capital expenditure requirements which are discussed above under “liquidity and capital resources” are substantial because of customer growth in aps’ service territory and inflationary impacts on the capital budget highlighting aps’ need for the timely recovery through rates of these and other expenditures on june 28 2007 the acc issued an order in a general rate case granting aps retail base rate increases the acc rate case decision and other retail and wholesale rate matters are discussed in note 3 

  fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas our hedging program for managing such costs and since april 1 2005 psa deferrals and the amortization thereof see “psa modifications” and “2006 deferrals” in note 3 for information regarding the psa including the 2006 deferrals aps’ recovery of psa deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and if necessary periodic psa adjustments 

  customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers and sales to them customer growth in aps’ service territory was 33 during 2007 customer growth averaged 40 a year for the three years 2005 through 2007 and we currently expect customer growth to decline averaging about 1 to 2 per year for 2008 through 2010 due to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in arizona for the three years 2005 through 2007 aps’ actual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours grew at an average annual rate of 48 adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations such retail sales growth averaged 38 a year we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will grow 1 to 2 on average per year during 2008 through 2010 excluding the effects of weather variations we currently expect our retail sales growth in 2008 to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate increases see note 3 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  weather in forecasting retail sales growth we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  wholesale market our marketing and trading activities focus primarily on managing aps’ risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand our marketing and trading activities include subject to specified parameters marketing hedging and trading in electricity fuels and emission allowances and credits see “rate requests for transmission and ancillary services” in note 3 for information regarding aps’ recent filing with the ferc requesting an increase in transmission rates 

other factors affecting financial results 

  operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant operations maintenance of utility plant including generation transmission and distribution facilities inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 

  depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation transmission and distribution facilities and changes in depreciation and amortization rates see “capital expenditures” above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 

  property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessment ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 83 of the assessed value for 2007 89 of assessed value for 2006 and 92 for 2005 we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant including new generation transmission and distribution facilities and as we improve our existing facilities see “capital expenditures” above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 

  interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities and internally generated cash flow capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

  retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail electric service providers providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional electric service providers will reenter aps’ service territory 

  subsidiaries suncor’s net income was 24 million in 2007 61 million in 2006 and 56 million in 2005 see note 17 for further discussion we currently expect suncor’s net income in 2008 to be approximately 20 million this estimate reflects continuation of the slowdown in the western united states real estate markets 

the historical results of apses pinnacle west marketing  trading and el dorado are not indicative of future performance 

  general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors see “forwardlooking statements” below for further information on such factors which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 

market risks 

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 

  interest rate and equity risk 

we have exposure to changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 12 the nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks associated with the changing market value of its investments nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas and emissions allowances our ermc consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities

regulatory matters 

see “pinnacle west consolidated – results of operations — regulatory matters” above for information about the acc’s order in aps’ general retail rate case and the psa 

2007 compared with 2006 

our net income for 2007 was 284 million compared with 270 million for 2006 aps’ net income increased approximately 14 million primarily due to higher retail sales related to customer growth the effects of weather on retail sales and impacts of the retail rate increase these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense primarily due to increased generation costs including increased maintenance and overhauls and the palo verde performance improvement plan customer service and other costs higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances higher interest expense due to higher debt balances and higher rates lower other income net of expense primarily due to miscellaneous asset sales in the prior year and lower interest income as a result of lower investment balances and a regulatory disallowance see note 3 in addition higher fuel and purchased power costs related to commodity price increases were partially offset by the deferral of such costs in accordance with the psa see note 3 for further discussion 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table dollars in millions 

 

electric operating revenues were 278 million higher for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of 

 

 

2006 compared with 2005 

aps’ net income for 2006 was 270 million compared with 170 million for the comparable prior year the 100 million increase was primarily due to an 84 million aftertax regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in 2005 income also increased due to higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth higher marketing and trading gross margin primarily due to higher marktomarket gains income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006 and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances partially offset by lower depreciation rates and higher interest expense in addition higher fuel and purchased power costs of 74 million aftertax were partially offset by the deferral of 45 million aftertax costs in accordance with the psa

regulation and competition 

retail 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet their own energy requirements 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’ retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers in 2000 an arizona superior court found that the rules were unconstitutional primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision to date the acc has taken no action on either the rules or the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision as a result at present only limited electric retail competition exists in 

arizona and only with certain entities not regulated by the acc aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

wholesale 

  general 

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services during 2006 approximately 44 of aps’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’ marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps’ fuel and purchased power risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer energy requirements the division also sells in the wholesale market aps’ generation output that is not needed for aps’ native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally the marketing and trading division subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades principally in electricity and fuels 

business of arizona public service company 

general 

aps was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of the state of arizona and currently has approximately 1052000 customers aps does not distribute any products during 2006 no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 61 of electric revenues see “overview – general” and “regulation and competition” above for additional background information about aps’ business 

at december 31 2006 aps employed approximately 6600 people including employees at jointlyowned generating facilities for which aps serves as the generating facility manager aps’ principal executive offices are located at 400 north fifth street po box 53999 phoenix arizona 850723999 telephone 6022501000 

purchased power and generating fuel 

see “properties – capacity” in item 2 for information about aps’ power plants by fuel types 

  2006 energy mix 

aps’ sources of energy during 2006 were purchased power – 350 coal – 312 gas – 173 and nuclear – 165 in accordance with gaap a substantial portion of aps’ purchased power contracts was netted against wholesale sales contracts on the statements of income see note 18 in item 8 

  coal supply 

  cholla cholla is a coalfired power plant located in northeastern arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps aps purchases most of cholla’s coal requirements from coal suppliers that mine all of the coal under longterm leases of coal reserves with the navajo nation the federal government and private landholders aps may purchase a portion of cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options and to supplement 

coal required for increased operating capacity aps believes that the current fuel contracts and competitive fuel supply options ensure the continued operation of cholla for its useful life in addition aps has a longterm coal transportation contract 

  four corners four corners is a coalfired power plant located in the northwestern corner of new mexico it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps aps purchases all of four corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a longterm lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation the four corners coal contract runs through july 2016 with options on aps’ part to extend the contract for five to fifteen additional years beyond the current plant site lease expiration in 2017 

  navajo generating station the navajo generating station is a coalfired power plant located in northern arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by salt river project the navajo generating station’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo generating station is under contract with its coal supplier through 2011 with options to extend through the current plant site lease expiration in 2019 the navajo generating station lease waives certain taxes through the lease expiration in 2019 items that may impact the fuel price include lease provisions that allow for a renegotiation of the coal royalty in 2007 and 2017 and a fuel contract requirement for a fiveyear price review in 2007 

see “legal proceedings” in item 3 for information about a lawsuit relating to royalties for coal paid by the participants at the navajo generating station 

see “properties – capacity” in item 2 for information about aps’ ownership interests in cholla four corners and the navajo generating station see note 11 in item 8 for information regarding aps’ coal mine reclamation obligations 

  natural gas supply 

see note 11 in item 8 for a discussion of aps’ natural gas supply 

  nuclear fuel supply 

  palo verde fuel cycle palo verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of phoenix arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

 

the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2007 and for approximately 70 of uranium concentrates and conversion services in 2008 the participants have 

also contracted for all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2010 80 of enrichment services through 2013 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services until at least 2015 

  spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal see “palo verde nuclear generating station” in note 11 in item 8 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal 

  purchased power 

in addition to its own available generating capacity see “properties” in item 2 aps purchases electricity under various arrangements one of the most important of these is a longterm contract with salt river project the amount of electricity available to aps is based in large part on customer demand within certain areas now served by aps pursuant to a related territorial agreement the generating capacity available to aps pursuant to the contract is 350 mw in 2006 aps received 550567 mwh of energy under the contract and paid about 661 million for capacity availability and energy received this contract may be canceled by salt river project on three years’ notice by letter dated june 7 2004 salt river project gave notice to aps to reduce capacity by 150 mw effective june 16 2007 to date this letter is the only notice salt river project has given under the contract aps may also cancel the contract on five years’ notice 

in september 1990 aps entered into a thirtyyear seasonal capacity exchange agreement with pacificorp under this agreement aps receives electricity from pacificorp during the summer peak season from may 15 to september 15 and aps returns electricity to pacificorp during the winter season from october 15 to february 15 until 2020 aps and pacificorp each has 480 mw of capacity and a related amount of energy available to it under the agreement for its respective seasons in 2006 aps received 571181 mwh of energy under the capacity exchange aps must also make additional offers of energy to pacificorp each year through october 31 2020 pursuant to this requirement during 2006 pacificorp received offers of 1105125 mwh and purchased 309750 mwh 

aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability consistent with the terms of the 2004 settlement agreement and as a result of seeking proposals from the competitive wholesale market aps entered into a number of agreements under which aps is entitled to purchase power including several agreements aggregating 650 mw running through 2015 covering aps’ peak periods aps has also entered into an agreement under which aps is entitled to the output of a 510 mw power plant from june 1 2007 through may 31 2017 aps has also agreed to purchase approximately 100 mw of renewable power wind geothermal and landfill gas under contracts that expire between 2025 and 2029 aps remains committed to seeking proposals from the competitive wholesale market for filling its future resource needs including for renewable capacity 

construction program 

during the years 2004 through 2006 aps incurred approximately 2 billion in capital expenditures aps’ capital expenditures for the years 2007 through 2009 are expected to be primarily for expanding transmission and distribution capabilities to meet growing customer needs for upgrading existing utility property and for environmental purposes aps’ capital expenditures were approximately 662 million in 2006 aps’ capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental control facilities for the years 2007 through 2009 net of contributions in aid of construction have been estimated as follows dollars in millions 

 

the above amounts exclude capitalized interest costs and include capitalized property taxes nuclear fuel of approximately 50 million in 2007 and 75 million per year for 2008 and 2009 is also included aps conducts a continuing review of its construction program 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – capital needs and resources” in item 7 for additional information about aps’ construction programs 

environmental matters 

epa environmental regulation 

  regional haze rules on april 22 1999 the epa announced final regional haze rules these regulations require states to submit state implementation plans sips by 2008 to demonstrate “reasonable progress” towards achieving natural visibility conditions in certain “class i areas” including several on the colorado plateau the sip is required to consider and potentially apply “best available retrofit technology” bart for certain older major stationary sources 

the rules allow nine western states and tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and schedule for the class i areas this alternate implementation plan is known as the annex rule five western states including arizona have submitted proposed sips to the epa to implement the annex rule 

on february 18 2005 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia granted a petition for review of the annex rule filed by the center for energy and economic development ceed aps phelps dodge corporation and the environmental defense were intervenors in the litigation in support of the epa and the annex rule although the court concluded that the epa has the authority to promulgate a bart alternative the court ruled that the epa must first conduct a bart analysis of eligible sources to demonstrate that the alternate plan would achieve greater emissions reductions than under an application of bart 

on june 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air visibility rule which amends the 1999 regional haze rules by providing guidelines known as the bart guidelines for states to use in determining which facilities must install controls and the type of controls the facilities must use on october 13 2006 the epa issued a final rule reconciling the annex rule with the ceed decision 

the arizona department of environmental quality adeq is currently undertaking a rulemaking process to amend its sip to reconcile with the annex rule litigation and sips to implement the clean air visibility rule requirements as part of the rulemaking process the adeq will require certain sources in the state to conduct bart analyses potentially including cholla and 

other aps plants the adeq’s regional haze sips are due to epa region 9 in december 2007 in addition we anticipate that epa region 9 may require four corners to conduct a bart analysis the company cannot currently predict the outcome of these proceedings 

  mercury on march 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air mercury rule camr to control mercury emissions from coalfired power plants this rule establishes performance standards limiting mercury emissions from coalfired power plants and establishes a two phased marketbased emissions trading program under the trading program the epa has assigned each state a mercury emissions “budget” and each state must submit to the epa a plan detailing how it will meet its “budget” in the first phase of the program beginning in 2010 mercury emissions from all coalfired power plants in the country will be reduced from a total of 48 tons per year to 38 tons in 2018 those emissions will be further reduced to 15 tons aps is currently evaluating the potential impact of this rule and as a result cannot currently estimate the expenditures which may be required 

in november 2006 the adeq submitted a sip to the epa to implement the camr adeq’s sip generally incorporates the epa’s model capandtrade program but it includes additional requirements including the requirement to meet a 90 mercury removal control level or 00087 lbsgwh whichever is greater the requirement to obtain mercury allowances at a 21 ratio for any emissions that fall below the specified control level and the requirement beginning in 2013 to consider clean coal technologies as part of permitting any new generation aps is evaluating the potential impacts of the proposed rule and cannot currently estimate the expenditures that may be required 

  federal implementation plan in september 1999 the epa proposed a fip to set air quality standards at certain power plants including the navajo generating station and the four corners power plant on july 26 2006 the sierra club sued the epa in an attempt to force the epa to issue a final fip to limit emissions at the four corners power plant on september 12 2006 the epa proposed a revised fip to establish air quality standards at four corners and the navajo generating station on september 18 2006 aps filed a motion to intervene in the sierra club’s lawsuit against the epa in order to assure that its interests are protected on november 22 2006 the court granted aps’ motion to intervene in the lawsuit in december 2006 the court issued a consent decree signed by the sierra club and the epa the consent decree requires epa to take “final action” on the proposed fip by april 30 2007 aps cannot currently predict the effect of the proposed fip on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity or whether the proposed fip will be adopted in its current form 

in addition on august 21 2006 the epa proposed a fip to implement “minor new source review” on indian reservations the fip if finalized would apply to four corners and the navajo generating station and would require preconstruction review and permitting of plant projects that meet specified criteria aps does not currently expect this fip to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  superfund superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within 

ou3 because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized neither aps nor pinnacle west can currently estimate the expenditures which may be required 

  manufactured gas plant sites aps is currently investigating properties which it now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors that were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo generating station are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation aps is the four corners operating agent aps owns all of four corners units 1 2 and 3 and a 15 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 aps owns a 14 interest in navajo generating station units 1 2 and 3 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the navajo acts the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo generating station on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo generating station the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo tribal council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the regulations fail to recognize that the navajo nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over four corners and the navajo generating station on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of the operating permit regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project as the operating agent for the navajo generating station and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement “vca” to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act on march 21 2006 the epa determined that the navajo nation was eligible for “treatment as a state” for the purpose of entering into a supplemental delegation agreement with the epa to administer the clean air act title v part 71 federal permit program over four corners and the navajo generating station the epa entered into the supplemental delegation agreement with the navajo nation on the same day because the epa’s approval was consistent with the requirements of the vca aps sought dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court as well as the pending litigation in the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act and the courts have dismissed the claims accordingly the agreement does not address or 

resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  west phoenix power plant 

during the period from november 2004 through march 2005 the maricopa county air quality department “mcaqd” issued a series of notices of violation “novs” to aps’ west phoenix power plant that generally allege that the plant failed to comply with applicable permit requirements the mcaqd subsequently rescinded most of the novs and imposed a penalty of approximately 20000 for the remaining novs which was paid in october 2006 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions 

both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding filed march 13 1975 before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ rights and the rights of the palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as operating agent of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’ other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court has not yet ruled on the petition no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court which was originally filed on september 5 1985 aps’ groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and is therefore potentially at issue in the case aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such 

rights a number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation neither aps nor pinnacle west expects that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on operations of the plant for 2007 and later years the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners 

federal energy legislation 

on august 8 2005 the president signed the energy policy act of 2005 into law the act includes a wide range of provisions addressing many aspects of the energy industry specifically with respect to the electric utility industry the act includes provisions which among other things repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 through enactment of the public utility holding company act of 2005 effective as of february 8 2006 creates incentives for the construction of transmission infrastructure eliminates the statutory restrictions on ownership of qualifying facilities by electric utilities establishes civil penalty authority over electric utilities and expands the authority of the ferc to include overseeing the reliability of the bulk power system while we continue to monitor the impact of this new federal legislation we cannot predict the impact of the act on our operations at this time

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries including aps 

  aps is subject to comprehensive government regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affect its business and results of operations 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business and results of operations the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and aps’ issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates while approved electric rates are intended to permit aps to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge consequently our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc 

aps is required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate aps’ business the ferc the nrc the epa and the acc regulate many aspects of our utility operations including siting and construction of facilities customer service and as noted in the preceding paragraph the rates that aps can charge customers we believe the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for aps’ existing operations and that aps’ business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects however changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 

on february 22 2007 the nrc issued a “white” finding low to moderate safety significance following an inspection of the palo verde emergency diesel generators after a palo verde unit 3 generator did not activate during routine inspections on july 25 and september 22 2006 this finding coupled with a previous nrc “yellow” finding relating to a 2004 matter involving palo verde’s safety injection systems will result in an enhanced nrc inspection regimen 

  aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase its cost of operations impact its business plans or expose it to environmental liabilities 

aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid waste and hazardous waste these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other approvals if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if aps fails to obtain maintain or comply with any such approval operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses in addition failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations we cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

in addition we may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

we cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps’ 

customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  concern over climate change could result in significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

concern over climate change deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions in 1998 the united states became a signatory to the kyoto protocol of the united nations framework convention on climate change  the kyoto protocol which became effective in february 2005 calls for developed nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to specified levels by 2012 co2 which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel is a greenhouse gas that would be regulated under the kyoto protocol the united states senate indicated that it would not enact the kyoto protocol and in 2002 president bush confirmed that the united states would not enter into the kyoto protocol instead the president indicated that the united states would support voluntary measures for reducing greenhouse gases and technologies that would use or dispose of co2 effectively and economically as the kyoto protocol becomes effective in other countries there is increasing pressure for sources in the united states to be subject to mandatory restrictions on co2 emissions in the last year the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions but such bills have not received sufficient congressional approval to date to become law if the united states ultimately ratifies the kyoto protocol andor if the united states congress or individual states or groups of states in which we operate ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases any resulting limitations on generation facility co2 emissions could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coal fired facilities including ours 

  there are inherent risks in the operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

through aps we have an ownership interest in and operate on behalf of a group of owners palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

the operation of palo verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed andor extended we do not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses however as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict 

  the operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power outages or reduced output which could materially affect our results of operations 

the operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency unscheduled outages including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business if aps’ facilities operate below expectations we may lose revenue or incur additional expenses 

  deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and our financial results 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’ service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

as a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers nonutility generators independent power producers and wholesale power marketers and brokers this increased competition could affect aps’ load forecasts plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues as a result of the changing regulatory environment and the relatively low barriers to entry we expect wholesale competition to increase 

  changes in technology may adversely affect our business 

research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce power including fuel cells micro turbines clean coal and coal gasification photovoltaic solar cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment such as more efficient gas turbines advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production making aps’ generating facilities less competitive in addition advances in technology could reduce the demand for power supply which could adversely affect aps’ business 

  our results of operations can be adversely affected by milder weather 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a 

result our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aps has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 

  our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries 

we conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries accordingly our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us 

the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us an acc financing order requires aps to indefinitely maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold the common equity ratio as defined in the acc order is common equity divided by common equity plus longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt 

  our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our subsidiaries 

because we are structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities none of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  if we are not able to access capital at competitive rates our ability to implement our financial strategy will be adversely affected 

we rely on access to shortterm money markets longerterm capital markets and the bank markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings however certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets such disruptions could include 

 

 

changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

 

  a further reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could limit our access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business and changing interest rates and market conditions could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

our operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices and subject to specified risk parameters engaging in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions allowances we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to 

hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default resulting in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

changing interest rates affect interest paid on variablerate debt and interest earned on variablerate securities in our pension plan other postretirement benefit plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are also impacted by the discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations declining interest rates impact the discount rate and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs cash contributions regulatory assets and charges to other comprehensive income the pension plan other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning trust funds also have risks associated with changing market values of fixed income and equity investments a significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices 

  actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

 

 

  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  we may enter into credit and other agreements from time to time that restrict our ability to pay dividends 

payment of dividends on our common stock may be restricted by credit and other agreements entered into by us from time to time there are currently no material restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under any such agreement 

  suncor’s business and financial performance could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting the real estate market 

suncor’s business and financial performance could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting the real estate market including downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions the potential overvaluation of land and new homes which could result in an economic down cycle for the homebuilding industry future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home which could prevent potential customers from buying homes in suncor’s developments competition for homebuyers or commercial customers or partners which could reduce suncor’s profitability supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials which could increase costs and delay deliveries government regulations which could increase the cost and limit the availability of suncor’s development homebuilding and commercial projects and inflation which could result in increased costs that suncor may not be able to recoup if demand declines 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2006 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

regulated electricity segment properties 

capacity 

aps’ present generating facilities have capacities as follows 

 

reserve margin 

aps’ 2006 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 21 2006 at 7652000 kw compared with the 2005 peak of 6999600 kw recorded on july 18 2005 taking into account additional capacity then available to aps under longterm purchased power contracts as well as aps’ generating capacity aps’ capability of meeting system demand on july 21 2006 amounted to 6783000 kw for an installed reserve margin of negative 127 the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages and technical problems the available capacity from sources actually operable at the time of the 2006 peak amounted to 5706000 kw for a margin of a negative 356 firm purchases totaling 3522000 kw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases were in place at the time of the peak ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement with an actual reserve margin of 70 

see “business of arizona public service company – purchased power and generating fuel – purchased power” in item 1 for information about certain of aps’ longterm power agreements 

plant sites leased from navajo nation 

the navajo generating station and four corners are located on land held under easements from the federal government and also under leases from the navajo nation these are longterm agreements and the leases contain options to extend aps does not believe that the risks with respect to enforcement of these easements and leases are material the majority of coal contracted for use in these plants and certain associated transmission lines are also located on indian reservations see “business of arizona public service company – purchased power and generating fuel – coal supply” in item 1 

palo verde nuclear generating station 

  regulatory 

operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 the full power operating licenses each valid for a period of approximately 40 years authorize aps as operating agent for palo verde to operate the three palo verde units at full power 

see “nrc inspection” in note 11 in item 8 for information regarding an nrc finding relating to an nrc inspection that will result in an enhanced nrc inspection regimen 

  nuclear decommissioning costs 

the nrc rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs through costofservice rates or through a “nonbypassable charge” the “nonbypassable systems benefits” charge is the charge that the acc has approved for aps’ recovery of certain types of costs including costs for low income programs demand side management consumer education environmental renewables etc “nonbypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider” other than aps the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s aps electric bill 

other mechanisms are prescribed including prepayment if the requirements for exclusive reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’ acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable “system benefits” charge which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism see note 12 in item 8 for additional information about aps’ nuclear decommissioning costs

  jointlyowned facilities 

aps shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’ interests in those jointlyowned facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 

 

 

 

  palo verde leases 

in 1986 aps sold about 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions aps accounts for these leases as operating leases the leases which have terms of 295 years contain options to renew the leases and to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms see notes 9 and 20 in item 8 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

transmission and distribution facilities 

aps’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5712 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 43 miles of underground lines 5486 miles of which are located within the state of arizona aps’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 12355 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 15222 miles of underground lines all of which are located within the state of arizona

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and arizona public service company’s financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report 

overview 

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so customer growth in aps’ service territory is about three times the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates the key issue affecting pinnacle west’s and aps’ financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc as discussed in greater detail in note 3 these proceedings consist of 

 

suncor our real estate development subsidiary has been and is expected to be an important source of earnings see discussion below in “pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook – subsidiaries” our subsidiary aps energy services provides competitive commodityrelated energy services and energyrelated products and services to commercial and industrial retail customers in the western united states el dorado our investment subsidiary owns minority interests in several energyrelated investments and arizona communitybased ventures 

pinnacle west energy was a subsidiary that owned and operated unregulated generating plants pursuant to the acc’s april 7 2005 order in aps’ retail rate settlement on july 29 2005 pinnacle west energy transferred the pwec dedicated assets to aps pinnacle west energy sold its 75 interest in silverhawk to npc on january 10 2006 see note 22 for a discussion of discontinued operations as a result pinnacle west energy no longer owned any generating plants and was dissolved as of august 31 2006 

we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities in the delivery area we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction we plan to expand longterm resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability 

see “pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook” below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results 

pinnacle west consolidated – earnings contribution by business segment 

pinnacle west’s two principal business segments are 

 

our reportable business segments reflect a change from the previously reported information as of december 31 2006 our marketing and trading activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate reporting or disclosure the marketing and trading activities consist of our competitive energy business including wholesale marketing and trading and retail commodityrelated energy services these activities have decreased as a result of fewer market opportunities and the company’s intention to deemphasize that part of our business these activities are now reported as part of the “other” category in the table below the corresponding information for earlier periods has been reclassified 

the following table summarizes income from continuing operations by segment for december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 and reconciles to net income in total dollars in millions

pinnacle west consolidated – results of operations 

general 

throughout the following explanations of our results of operations we refer to “gross margin” with respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading contributions gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs “gross margin” is a “nongaap financial measure” as defined in accordance with sec rules exhibit 9929 reconciles this nongaap financial measure to operating income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses 

deferred fuel and purchased power costs 

our subsidiary aps settled its 2003 general retail rate case effective april 1 2005 as part of the settlement the acc approved the psa which permits aps to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs subject to specified parameters in accordance with the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates aps’ recovery of psa deferrals from its customers is subject to the acc’s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications see “power supply adjustor” in note 3 

since the inception of the psa aps has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through aps’ current base rates primarily due to the use of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the psa the balance of aps’ psa deferrals at december 31 2006 was approximately 160 million the recovery of psa deferrals through acc approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollarfordollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power 

aps operated palo verde unit 1 at reduced power levels from december 25 2005 until march 18 2006 due to vibration levels in one of the unit’s shutdown cooling lines during an outage at unit 1 from march 18 2006 to july 7 2006 aps performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation aps estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and other unplanned palo verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately 88 million during 2006 the related impact on the psa deferrals was an increase of approximately 79 million these palo verde replacement power costs were partially offset by 42 million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to aps’ other generating units during 2006 which decreased psa deferrals by 38 million 

the psa deferral balance at december 31 2006 includes a 45 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2005 palo verde outages and b 79 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at palo verde the psa deferrals associated with these unplanned palo verde outages 

and reduced power operations are the subject of acc prudence reviews the acc staff has recommended disallowance of 17 million of the 2005 costs the recommendation will be considered as part of aps’ general rate case currently before the acc see “psa deferrals related to unplanned palo verde outages” in note 3 the acc staff recommendation does not change management’s belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and therefore are recoverable see note 3 

2006 compared with 2005 

our consolidated net income for 2006 was 327 million compared with 176 million for the comparable prioryear period the prior year included a net loss from discontinued operations of 47 million which was related to the sale and operations of silverhawk partially offset by income from sales of real estate commercial properties at suncor income from continuing operations increased 94 million in the periodtoperiod comparison reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment

2005 compared with 2004 

our consolidated net income for 2005 was 176 million compared with 243 million for the prior year the 2005 net income included an aftertax net loss from discontinued operations of 47 million compared with a 4 million aftertax loss in the prior year which for both years is related primarily to the sale and operations of silverhawk partially offset by sales of commercial properties at suncor income from continuing operations decreased 24 million in the periodtoperiod comparison reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment 

 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income are contained in the following table dollars in millions

  capital expenditure requirements 

the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for the year ended 2006 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 

capital expenditures dollars in millions 

 

 

 distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include lines substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems major transmission projects are driven by strong regional customer growth 

generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear plants and the replacement of palo verde steam generators see below examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment environmental expenditures are estimated at approximately 80 million to 100 million per year for 2007 2008 and 2009 generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately 50 million for 2007 and approximately 75 million per year for 2008 and 2009 

the palo verde owners have approved the manufacture of one additional set of steam generators these generators will be installed in unit 3 and are scheduled for completion in the fall of 2007 at an approximate cost of 70 million aps’ share approximately 30 million of the unit 3 steam generator costs have been incurred through december 31 2006 with the remaining 40 

million included in the capital expenditures table above capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash andor external financings 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 

   offbalance sheet arrangements 

in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and accordingly do not consolidate them 

aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur under certain circumstances for example the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had occurred as of december 31 2006 aps would have been required to assume approximately 214 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately 177 million 

  guarantees and letters of credit 

we and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of credit in support of our unregulated businesses we have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of aps energy services we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to these obligations we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit 

  credit ratings 

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february 28 2007 are shown below the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’ securities and serve to increase the cost of and access to capital it may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments see note 18 

 

 

 47 

  debt provisions 

pinnacle west’s and aps’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios certain of aps’ bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements for both pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 at december 31 2006 the ratio was approximately 48 for pinnacle west and 46 for aps the provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps the interest coverage was approximately 47 times under aps’ bank financing agreements as of december 31 2006 failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt see further discussion of “crossdefault” provisions below 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however in the event of a rating downgrade pinnacle west andor aps may be subject to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements 

all of pinnacle west’s loan agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’ bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings

capital needs and resources 

  pinnacle west parent company 

our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our longterm debt on october 18 2006 our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated annual rate of 210 per share from 200 per share effective with the december 1 2006 dividend payment the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries primarily suncor for the years 2004 through 2006 total dividends from aps were 510 million and total distributions from suncor were 145 million for 2006 cash contributions from aps were 170 million and distributions from suncor were 10 million an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and prohibits aps from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold as defined in the acc order the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2006 aps’ common equity ratio as defined was approximately 53 

at december 31 2006 pinnacle west’s outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was 175 million pinnacle west has a 300 million revolving credit facility that terminates in december 2010 this line of credit is available to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit at december 31 2006 we had 28 million of commercial paper outstanding 

pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a nonqualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and its subsidiaries irs regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation the assets in the plan are comprised of common stocks bonds fixedincome securities and domestic equity securities and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on fund performance and plan asset valuation assumptions we contributed approximately 47 million in 2006 the contribution to our pension plan in 2007 is estimated to be approximately 24 million the expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2007 is estimated to be approximately 25 million aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions aps’ share is approximately 97 of both plans 

in january 2006 pinnacle west infused into aps 210 million of the proceeds from the sale of silverhawk see “equity infusions” in note 3 for more information 

on february 28 2006 pinnacle west entered into an uncommitted master shelf agreement with prudential investment management inc “prudential” and certain of its affiliates the agreement provides the terms under which pinnacle west may offer up to 200 million of its senior notes for purchase by prudential affiliates at any time prior to december 31 2007 the maturity of notes issued under the agreement cannot exceed five years pursuant to the agreement on february 28 2006 pinnacle west issued and sold to prudential affiliates 175 million of its 591 senior notes series a due february 28 2011 the “series a notes” 

on april 3 2006 pinnacle west repaid 300 million of its 640 senior notes due april 2006 pinnacle west used the proceeds of the series a notes cash on hand and commercial paper proceeds to repay these notes 

on january 4 2007 the ferc issued an order permitting pinnacle west to transfer its market based rate tariff and wholesale power sales agreements to a newlycreated pinnacle west subsidiary pinnacle west marketing  trading pinnacle west completed the transfer on february 1 2007 which resulted in pinnacle west no longer being a public utility under the federal power act as a result pinnacle west is no longer subject to ferc jurisdiction in connection with its issuance of securities or its incurrence of longterm debt 

  aps 

aps’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of longterm debt aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external financings aps has historically paid its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a 

discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 

although provisions in aps’ articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that aps may issue aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements on december 15 2006 aps filed a financing application with the acc requesting an increase in aps’ current longterm debt authorization approximately 32 billion to approximately 42 billion in light of the projected growth of aps and its customer base and the resulting projected future financing needed to fund aps’ capital expenditure and maintenance program and other cash requirements 

on august 3 2006 aps issued 400 million of debt as follows 250 million of its 625 notes due 2016 and 150 million of its 6875 notes due 2036 a portion of the proceeds was used to pay at maturity approximately 84 million of aps’ 675 senior notes due november 15 2006 the remainder may be used to fund its construction program and other general corporate purposes 

on september 28 2006 aps put in place an additional 500 million revolving credit facility that terminates in september 2011 aps may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum facility of 600 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions aps will use the facility for general corporate purposes the facility can also be used for the issuance of letters of credit interest rates are based on aps’ senior unsecured debt credit ratings 

see “deferred fuel and purchased power costs” above and “power supply adjustor” in note 3 for information regarding the psa approved by the acc although aps defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis aps’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to the acc’s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications during 2006 aps recovered approximately 265 million of psa deferrals which provided cash flow but had no effect on earnings because of amortization of the same amount recorded as fuel and purchased power expense 

aps’ outstanding debt was approximately 29 billion at december 31 2006 aps has two committed lines of credit totaling 900 million that are available either to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit the 400 million line terminates in december 2010 and the 500 million line terminates in september 2011 at december 31 2006 aps had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings aps ended 2006 in an invested cash position 

see “cash flow hedges” in note 18 for information related to decreased collateral provided to us by counterparties and the change in our margin account 

  other subsidiaries 

during the past three years suncor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings suncor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures during 2006 and projected capital expenditures for the next 

three years suncor expects to fund its future capital requirements with cash from operations and external financings 

suncor’s total outstanding debt was approximately 189 million as of december 31 2006 including 118 million of debt classified as longterm debt under a 170 million line of credit suncor’s longterm debt including current maturities was 181 million and total shortterm debt was 8 million at december 31 2006 see note 6 

see note 22 for a discussion of the sale of pinnacle west energy’s 75 ownership interest in silverhawk 

el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 

aps energy services and pinnacle west marketing  trading expect minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates we had 846 million including 160 million related to the psa of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 included in the 160 million is approximately 45 million related to the 2005 unplanned palo verde outages and 79 million related to the 2006 unplanned outages which currently are the subject of inquiry by the acc 

at december 31 2006 aps recorded a regulatory asset of 473 million in accordance with sfas no 158 for pension and other postretirement benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci 

in addition we had 635 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 which primarily are related to removal costs see notes 1 3 and 8 for more information about regulatory assets aps’ general rate case and the psa 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2006 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2006 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2006 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2006 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

derivative accounting 

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met for fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 

the fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable in some cases we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions see “market risks – commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 

other accounting matters 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” this guidance requires us to recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating this new guidance and believe it will not have a material impact on retained earnings 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating this new guidance 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas no 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value sfas no 159 is effective for us on january 1 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard 

see the following notes for information about new accounting standards 

 

pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook 

factors affecting operating revenues fuel and purchased power costs 

  general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states for the years 2004 through 2006 retail electric revenues comprised approximately 82 of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix customer growth average usage per customer electricity rates and tariffs variations in weather from period to period and amortization of psa deferrals competitive retail sales of energy and energyrelated products and services are made by aps energy services in certain western states that have opened to competition offsystem sales of excess generation output purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because the gross margin is credited to aps’ retail customers through the psa see note 3 these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including demand and prices competitive wholesale transactions are made by the marketing and trading group through structured trading opportunities involving matched sales and purchases of commodities 

  retail rate proceedings the key issue affecting pinnacle west’s and aps’ financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc which are discussed in greater detail in note 3 the most significant pending retail rate proceedings are aps’ general rate case request and an application for a 19 psa surcharge or temporary rate increase related to incremental replacement power costs incurred by aps in 2005 in connection with 

unplanned outages at palo verde which is subject to the acc’s review of the unplanned outages these matters have been consolidated procedurally and a decision on them by the acc is expected in the second quarter of 2007 in addition the acc staff is conducting a review of the prudence of approximately 79 million in psa deferrals related to 2006 unplanned outages at palo verde 

  fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our income statements are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas our hedging program for managing such costs and since april 1 2005 psa deferrals and amortization thereof see “power supply adjustor” in note 3 for information regarding the psa including psa deferrals related to palo verde unplanned outages and reduced power operations that are the subject of acc prudence reviews see “natural gas supply” in note 11 for more information on fuel costs aps’ recovery of psa deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to the acc’s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications 

  customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to native load customers and sales to them customer growth in aps’ service territory was 44 during 2006 such growth averaged 41 a year for the three years from 2004 through 2006 and we currently expect customer growth to average about 40 per year from 2007 to 2009 for the three years 2004 through 2006 aps’ actual retail electricity sales in kilowatthours grew at an average rate of 42 adjusted to exclude effects of weather variations such retail sales growth averaged 46 a year we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will grow 32 on average from 2007 through 2009 before the effects of weather variations we currently expect our retail sales growth in 2007 to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the retail rate increases proposed by aps see note 3 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  weather in forecasting retail sales growth we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  wholesale market conditions the marketing and trading group focuses primarily on managing aps’ risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand the marketing and trading group subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades in electricity fuels and emission allowances and credits 

other factors affecting financial results 

  operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant additions and operations inflation outages highertrending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 

  depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property which include generation construction changes in depreciation and amortization rates and changes in regulatory asset amortization 

  property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by the value of property inservice and under construction assessed valuation ratios and tax rates the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 89 of assessed value for 2006 and 92 for 2005 and 2004 we expect property taxes to increase as new power plants including the sundance plant acquired in 2005 and additions to our transmission and distribution facilities are included in the property tax base 

  interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures longterm debt maturities and internally generated cash flow capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 

  retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

  subsidiaries suncor’s net income was 61 million in 2006 56 million in 2005 and 45 million in 2004 see note 22 for further discussion we currently expect suncor’s net income in 2007 will be between 30 million and 35 million this estimate reflects a slowdown in the western united states residential real estate markets 

aps energy services’ and el dorado’s historical results are not indicative of future performance 

  general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors see “forwardlooking statements” for further information on such factors which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 

market risks 

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 

  interest rate and equity risk 

we have exposure to changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 12 the nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks associated with the changing market value of its investments nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions allowances we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps our ermc consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities in addition subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ermc we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements 

the marktomarket value of derivative instruments related to our risk management and trading activities are presented in two categories

 credit risk 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties see note 1 “derivative accounting” for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy see note 18 for further discussion of credit risk 

arizona public service company – results of operations 

general 

throughout the following explanations of our results of operations we refer to “gross margin” gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs gross margin is a “nongaap financial measure” as defined in accordance with sec rules exhibit 9930 reconciles this nongaap financial measure to operating income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses 

deferred fuel and purchased power costs 

the settlement of our 2003 general retail rate case became effective april 1 2005 as part of the settlement the acc approved the psa which permits aps to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs subject to specified parameters in accordance with the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates aps’ recovery of psa deferrals from its customers is subject to the acc’s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications see “power supply adjustor” in note 3 

since the inception of the psa aps has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through aps’ current base rates primarily due to the use of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the psa the balance of aps’ psa deferrals at december 31 2006 was approximately 160 million the recovery of psa deferrals through acc approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollarfordollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power 

aps operated palo verde unit 1 at reduced power levels from december 25 2005 until march 18 2006 due to vibration levels in one of the unit’s shutdown cooling lines during an outage at unit 1 from march 18 2006 to july 7 2006 aps performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation aps estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and other unplanned palo verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately 88 million during 2006 the related impact on the psa deferrals was an increase of 

approximately 79 million these palo verde replacement power costs were partially offset by 42 million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to aps’ other generating units during 2006 which decreased psa deferrals by 38 million 

the psa deferral balance at december 31 2006 includes a 45 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2005 palo verde outages and b 79 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at palo verde the psa deferrals associated with these unplanned palo verde outages and reduced power operations are the subject of acc prudence reviews the acc staff has recommended disallowance of 17 million of the 2005 costs the recommendation will be considered as part of aps’ general rate case currently before the acc see “psa deferrals related to unplanned palo verde outages” in note 3 the acc staff recommendation does not change management’s belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and therefore are recoverable see note 3 

2006 compared with 2005 

aps’ net income for the 2006 was 270 million compared with 170 million for the comparable prioryear period the 100 million increase was primarily due to an 84 million aftertax regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in 2005 income also increased due to higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth higher marketing and trading gross margin primarily due to higher marktomarket gains income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006 and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances partially offset by lower depreciation rates and higher interest expense in addition higher fuel and purchased power costs of 74 million aftertax were partially offset by the deferral of 45 million aftertax of costs in accordance with the psa see discussion – “deferred fuel and purchased power costs” above 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income are contained in the following table dollars in millions 

 

regulated electricity revenues 

regulated electricity revenues were 396 million higher for 2006 compared with the prioryear period primarily as a result of 

 

 

marketing and trading revenues 

marketing and trading revenues were 8 million lower for 2006 compared with the prioryear period primarily as a result of 

 

2005 compared with 2004 

aps’ net income for 2005 was 170 million compared with 200 million for the prior year the 30 million decrease was primarily due to the regulatory disallowance of plant costs in accordance with the aps retail rate case settlement higher fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to higher prices and more plant outage days higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service costs and higher property taxes due to increased plant in service these negative factors were partially offset by deferred fuel and purchased power costs a retail price increase effective april 1 2005 higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth lower depreciation due to lower depreciation rates lower regulatory asset amortization and effects of weather on retail sales 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income are contained in the following table dollars in millions 

 

regulated electricity revenues 

regulated electricity revenues were 193 million higher for 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of 

 

marketing and trading revenues

regulation and competition 

retail 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona as a result as of january 1 2001 all of aps’ retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers in 2000 an arizona superior court found that the rules were unconstitutional primarily on procedural grounds and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona in 2004 the arizona court of appeals invalidated some but not all of the rules in 2005 the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision to date the acc has taken no action on either the rules or the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision as a result at present only limited electric retail competition exists in arizona and only with certain entities not regulated by the acc aps cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned utilities in arizona such as tucson electric power company and southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit 6 

organizations principally salt river project aps also faces competition from lowcost hydroelectric power and parties that have access to lowpriced preferential federal power and other governmental subsidies in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet their own energy requirements 

wholesale 

  general 

the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services during 2005 approximately 53 of aps’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services aps’ marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps’ fuel and purchased power risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer energy requirements the division also sells in the wholesale market aps’ generation output that is not needed for aps’ native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers additionally the marketing and trading division subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades principally in electricity and fuels 

  regional transmission organizations 

in a december 1999 order the ferc established characteristics and functions that must be met by utilities in forming and operating rtos the characteristics for an acceptable rto include independence from market participants operational control over a region large enough to support efficient and nondiscriminatory markets and exclusive authority to maintain shortterm reliability on october 16 2001 aps and other owners of electric transmission lines in the southwestern us filed with the ferc a request for a declaratory order confirming that their proposal to form westconnect rto llc would satisfy the ferc’s requirements for the formation of an rto on october 10 2002 the ferc issued an order finding that the westconnect proposal if modified to address specified issues could meet the ferc’s rto requirements and provide the basic framework for a standard market design for the southwestern united states since that time aps and other supporters of the westconnect efforts have been evaluating a phased approach to rto implementation of regional structures in the desert southwest

at december 31 2005 aps employed approximately 6400 people including employees at jointlyowned generating facilities for which aps serves as the generating facility manager aps’ principal executive offices are located at 400 north fifth street po box 53999 phoenix arizona 850723999 telephone 6022501000 

purchased power and generating fuel 

see “properties – capacity” in item 2 for information about aps’ power plants by fuel types 

  2005 energy mix 

aps’ sources of energy during 2005 were purchased power – 518 coal – 263 nuclear – 151 and gas – 68 in accordance with gaap a substantial portion of our purchased power contracts was netted against wholesale sales contracts on the statements of income see note 18 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  coal supply 

  cholla cholla is a coalfired power plant located in northeastern arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps aps purchases most of cholla’s coal requirements from coal suppliers that mine all of the coal under a longterm lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation the federal government and private landholders aps may purchase a portion of cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options and to supplement coal required for increased operating capacity aps believes that the current fuel contracts and competitive fuel supply options ensure the continued operation of cholla for its useful life in addition aps has a longterm coal transportation contract 

  four corners four corners is a coalfired power plant located in the northwestern corner of new mexico it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps aps purchases all of four corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a longterm lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation the four corners coal contract runs through july 2016 with options to extend the contract for five to fifteen additional years beyond the current plant site lease expiration in 2017 

  navajo generating station the navajo generating station is a coalfired power plant located in northern arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by salt river project the navajo generating station’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with longterm leases from the navajo nation and the hopi tribe the navajo generating station is under contract with its coal supplier through 2011 with options to extend through the current plant site lease expiration in 2019 the navajo generating station lease waives certain taxes through the lease expiration in 2019 items that may impact the fuel price include lease provisions that allow for a renegotiation of the coal royalty in 2007 and 2017 and a fuel contract requirement for a fiveyear price review in 2007 in addition the december 31 2005 closure of the mohave generating station has not had a significant impact on the cost structure for the black mesa – kayenta mine complex aps does not have an ownership interest in the mohave generating station but understands the plant could be restarted however if the mohave generating station is permanently closed there is a potential for increased costs to the navajo generating station which is served by the kayenta mine aps does not currently expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity

  nuclear fuel supply 

  palo verde fuel cycle palo verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of phoenix arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages 

 

the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2008 the palo verde participants have also contracted for all of palo verde’s enrichment services through 2010 80 of enrichment services through 2013 and all of palo verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services until at least 2015 

  spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal see “palo verde nuclear generating station” in note 11 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal 

  purchased power 

in addition to its own available generating capacity see “properties” in item 2 aps purchases electricity under various arrangements one of the most important of these is a longterm contract with salt river project the amount of electricity available to aps is based in large part on customer demand within certain areas now served by aps pursuant to a related territorial agreement the generating capacity available to aps pursuant to the contract is 350 mw in 2005 aps received 552014 mwh of energy under the contract and paid about 666 million for capacity availability and energy received this contract may be canceled by salt river project on three years’ notice by letter dated june 7 2004 salt river project gave notice to aps to reduce capacity by 150 mw effective june 16 2007 to date this letter is the only notice salt river project has given under the contract aps may also cancel the contract on five years’ notice which may be given no earlier than december 31 2006 

in september 1990 aps entered into a thirtyyear seasonal capacity exchange agreement with pacificorp under this agreement aps receives electricity from pacificorp during the summer peak season from may 15 to september 15 and aps returns electricity to pacificorp during the winter season from october 15 to february 15 until 2020 aps and pacificorp each has 480 mw 9 

of capacity and a related amount of energy available to it under the agreement for its respective seasons in 2005 aps received 571492 mwh of energy under the capacity exchange aps must also make additional offers of energy to pacificorp each year through october 31 2020 pursuant to this requirement during 2005 pacificorp received offers of 1090700 mwh and purchased 372473 mwh 

aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability under the terms of the 2004 settlement agreement aps committed to seek proposals from the competitive wholesale market for filling its future resource needs the current reliability rfp identifies the amount of capacity and energy needed to reliably meet expected customer demands and sought proposals for at least 1000 mw of new generating capacity for 2007 and beyond aps has entered into contracts for more than 650 mw of capacity and expects to finalize the remaining contract by the end of the first quarter of 2006 

aps also has a renewable rfp seeking at least 100 mw of renewable capacity with a capability of producing at least 250000 mwh annually in accordance with the terms of the 2004 settlement agreement power must be deliverable to the aps transmission system and its pricing must not exceed 125 of conventional resource alternatives during 2005 aps conducted a competitive procurement process for renewable energy resources the process resulted in the acquisition of approximately 145 mw of renewable energy resources via purchased power agreements at an acc open meeting on november 8 2005 the acc approved aps’ acquisition of outofstate renewable resources the acc also ordered aps to work with the acc staff to evaluate two instate projects and report back within two months aps has completed this evaluation process and has filed a report with the acc the acc agreed with aps’ evaluation that the instate projects were not economical 

construction program 

during the years 2003 through 2005 aps incurred approximately 17 billion in capital expenditures aps’ capital expenditures for the years 2006 through 2008 are expected to be primarily for expanding transmission and distribution capabilities to meet growing customer needs for upgrading existing utility property and for environmental purposes aps’ capital expenditures were approximately 809 million in 2005 aps’ capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental control facilities for the years 2006 through 2008 net of contributions in aid of construction have been estimated as follows dollars in millions 

 

the above amounts exclude capitalized interest costs and include capitalized property taxes and approximately 35 million per year for nuclear fuel aps conducts a continuing review of its construction program 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – capital needs and resources by company” in item 7 for additional information about aps’ construction programs 

environmental matters 

  epa environmental regulation 

  regional haze rules on april 22 1999 the epa announced final regional haze rules these regulations require states to submit state implementation plans by 2008 to make reasonable progress towards achieving natural visibility conditions in certain specified areas including class i areas in the colorado plateau and to consider and potentially apply the best available retrofit technology “bart” for major stationary sources 

the rules allow nine western states and tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and schedule for the class i areas this alternate implementation plan is known as the annex rule five western states including arizona have submitted proposed state implementation plans to the epa to implement the annex rule 

on february 18 2005 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia granted a petition for review of the annex rule filed by the center for energy and economic development ceed aps phelps dodge corporation and the environmental defense were intervenors in the litigation in support of the epa and the annex rule although the court concluded that the epa has the authority to promulgate a bart alternative the court ruled that the epa must first conduct a bart analysis of eligible sources to demonstrate that the alternate plan would achieve greater emissions reductions than bart on june 15 2005 epa issued the clean air visibility rule which amends the 1999 regional haze rules by providing guidelines known as the bart guidelines for states to use in determining which facilities must install controls and the type of controls the facilities must use on august 1 2005 the epa proposed a rule to among other things reconcile the annex rule with the ceed decision we are currently evaluating the impact of this proposed rule the company cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  mercury on march 15 2005 the epa issued the clean air mercury rule to regulate mercury emissions from coalfired power plants this rule establishes performance standards limiting mercury emissions from coalfired power plants and establishes a two phased marketbased trading program under the trading program the epa has assigned each state a “budget” for reducing coalfired power plant mercury emissions and each state must submit to the epa a plan detailing how it will meet its “budget” in the first phase of the program beginning in 2010 mercury emissions will be reduced from a total of 48 tons per year to 38 tons in 2018 mercury emissions will be further reduced to 15 tons aps is currently evaluating the potential impact of this rule and as a result cannot currently estimate the expenditures which may be required 

by november 2006 the adeq will submit a state implementation plan to the epa to implement the clean air mercury rule or an alternative mercury program as authorized by the epa the mercury program for four corners will be implemented by epa region ix or if it seeks and obtains program approval by the navajo nation aps is still evaluating the potential impacts of the state implementation plan on cholla and of the clean air mercury rule on cholla and four corners and cannot currently estimate the expenditures which may be required 

  federal implementation plan in september 1999 the epa proposed a fip to set air quality standards at certain power plants including the navajo generating station and four corners the fip is similar to current arizona regulation of the navajo generating station and new mexico regulation of four corners with minor modifications aps does not currently expect the fip to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  superfund superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps prps may be strictly and often jointly and severally liable for cleanup on september 3 2003 the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola 52 nd street superfund site operable unit 3 ou3 in phoenix arizona aps has facilities that are within this superfund site aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou3 because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized neither aps nor pinnacle west can currently estimate the expenditures which may be required 

  manufactured gas plant sites aps is currently investigating properties which it now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors that were at one time sites of or sites associated with manufactured gas plants aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

  navajo nation environmental issues 

four corners and the navajo generating station are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation aps is the four corners operating agent aps owns all of four corners units 1 2 and 3 and a 15 interest in four corners units 4 and 5 aps owns a 14 interest in navajo generating station units 1 2 and 3 

in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively the navajo acts the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide activities including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo generating station on october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation window rock district challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo generating station the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 

in april 2000 the navajo tribal council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act aps believes the regulations fail to recognize that the navajo nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over four corners and the navajo generating station on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of the operating permit regulations those proceedings have been stayed pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

on may 18 2005 aps salt river project and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement “vca” to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act the fundamental premise of the vca is that the navajo nation epa may regulate air issues for four corners and the navajo generating station only because the participants have agreed to submit to such regulation for the term of the agreement and under certain circumstances if the epa approves the navajo nation’s air programs consistent with the vca aps would seek dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the pending litigation in the navajo nation district court to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 

  west phoenix power plant 

during the period from november 2004 through march 2005 the maricopa county air quality department “mcaqd” issued a series of notices of violation “novs” to aps’ west phoenix power plant that generally allege that the plant failed to comply with applicable permit requirements aps is currently engaged in discussions with mcaqd concerning the novs we do not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

water supply 

assured supplies of water are important for aps’ generating plants at the present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions 

both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps’ operations have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding before a state court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985 however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication the navajo nation will provide for an agreed upon cost sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 

a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior court palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ rights and the rights of the palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action as project manager of palo verde aps filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights five of aps’ other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court in december 2005 aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting 

interlocutory review of a september 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights the court has not yet ruled on the petition no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court aps’ groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and is therefore potentially at issue in the case aps’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights a number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps’ water rights claims has been set in this matter 

although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation neither aps nor pinnacle west expects that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position results of operations cash flows or liquidity 

the four corners region in which four corners is located has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect if any on operations of the plant for 2006 and later years the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price thereof from four corners

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

  we are subject to comprehensive government regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affect our business and our results of operations 

aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business and results of operations the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and aps’ issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us aps and our respective affiliates our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc see note 3 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aps is required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate aps’ business the ferc the nrc the epa and the acc regulate many aspects of our utility operations including siting and construction of facilities customer service and as noted in the preceding paragraph the rates that aps can charge customers we believe the necessary permits approvals and certificates have been obtained for aps’ existing operations however changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 

we cannot predict the outcome of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc 

as noted above our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc these proceedings consist of a general retail rate case an application for an emergency interim rate increase and an application for two separate surcharges under the psa see note 3 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 we cannot predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings or the resulting levels of regulated revenues 

  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations impact our business plans or expose us to environmental liabilities 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations including air emissions water quality wastewater discharges solid 

waste and hazardous waste these laws and regulations can result in increased capital operating and other costs particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations these laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other approvals both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations we cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

in addition we may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 

we cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from aps’ customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  there are inherent risks in the operation of nuclear facilities such as environmental health and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 

through aps we have an ownership interest in and operate on behalf of a group of owners palo verde which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states palo verde is subject to environmental health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems we maintain nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize our financial exposure to some of these risks however it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde if an incident did occur it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

  deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and our financial results 

in 1999 the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on us due to an impairment of assets a loss of retail customers lower profit margins or increased costs of capital although some very limited retail competition existed in the service area of aps in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

as a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers nonutility generators independent power producers and wholesale power marketers and brokers this increased competition could affect our load forecasts plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues as a result of the changing regulatory environment and the relatively low barriers to entry we expect wholesale competition to increase 

  our results of operations can be adversely affected by milder weather 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities electric power demand is generally a seasonal business in arizona demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time as a result our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder as a result unusually mild weather could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 

  our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries 

we conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries accordingly our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us 

the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us an acc financing order requires aps to indefinitely maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold as defined in the acc financing order approving the arrangement common equity ratio is common equity divided by common equity plus longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2005 aps’ common equity ratio as defined was approximately 54 

  our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our subsidiaries 

because we are structured as a holding company all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities none of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available in the first instance to service their own debt and other obligations our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 

  if we are not able to access capital at competitive rates our ability to implement our financial strategy will be adversely affected 

we rely on access to shortterm money markets longerterm capital markets and the bank markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings however certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets such disruptions could include 

 

changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans additionally an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by 

 

  a further reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any downgrade could increase our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in addition borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings a downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties if our shortterm ratings were to be lowered it could limit our access to the commercial paper market we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

  the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business and changing interest rates and market conditions could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 

our operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices and subject to specified risk parameters engaging in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions allowances we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our overall risk management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity 

we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default resulting in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 

changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and interest earned on variablerate securities in our pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt the pension plan is also impacted by the discount rate which is the interest rate used to discount future pension obligations declining interest rates impact the discount rate and may result in increases in pension costs cash contributions and charges to other comprehensive income the pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds also have risks associated with changing market values of fixed income and equity investments a significant portion of the pension costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices 

actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management must often make estimates and assumptions 

that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

 

 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

in addition the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  we may enter into credit and other agreements from time to time that restrict our ability to pay dividends 

payment of dividends on our common stock may be restricted by credit and other agreements entered into by us from time to time at december 31 2005 there were no material restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under any such agreement 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

neither pinnacle west nor aps has received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2005 fiscal year and that remain unresolved  




 item 2 properties 

capacity 

aps’ present generating facilities have capacities as follows 

 

 

 reserve margin 

aps’ 2005 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july 18 2005 at 6999600 kw compared with the 2004 peak of 6402100 kw recorded on august 11 2004 taking into account additional capacity then available to aps under longterm purchase power contracts as well as aps’ generating capacity aps’ capability of meeting system demand on july 18 2005 amounted to 6383000 kw for an installed reserve margin of negative 133 the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages and technical problems the available capacity from sources actually operable at the time of the 2005 peak amounted to 3820000 kw for a margin of a negative 514 firm purchases totaling 4653000 kw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases were in place at the time of the peak ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement with an actual reserve margin of 193 

see “business of arizona public service company – purchased power and generating fuel – purchased power” in item 1 for information about certain of aps’ longterm power agreements 

plant sites leased from navajo nation 

the navajo generating station and four corners are located on land held under easements from the federal government and also under leases from the navajo nation these are longterm agreements with options to extend and aps does not believe that the risks with respect to enforcement of these easements and leases are material the majority of coal contracted for use in these plants and certain associated transmission lines are also located on indian reservations see “business of arizona public service company – purchased power and generating fuel – coal supply” in item 1 

palo verde nuclear generating station 

  regulatory 

operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 the full power operating licenses each valid for a period of approximately 40 years authorize aps as operating agent for palo verde to operate the three palo verde units at full power 

in 2004 the nrc determined that there had been a safety concern with palo verde’s procedures related to safety injection system piping this led to a “yellow” finding under the nrc’s inspection criteria and put palo verde in the “degraded safety cornerstone” column of the nrc’s performance matrix resulting in a supplemental nrc inspection the nrc completed its supplemental inspection during 2005 and issued its report closing one finding and indicating it would follow up on another finding at some later time upon notice from aps 

  nuclear decommissioning costs 

the nrc rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs through costofservice rates or through a “nonbypassable charge” the “nonbypassable systems benefits” charge is the charge that the acc has approved for aps’ recovery of certain types of costs including costs for low income programs demand side management consumer education environmental renewables etc “nonbypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider” other than aps the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s aps electric bill 

other mechanisms are prescribed including prepayment if the requirements for exclusive reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for its interests in palo verde units 1 2 and 3 the decommissioning costs of palo verde units 1 2 and 3 are currently included in aps’ acc jurisdictional rates decommissioning costs are recoverable through a nonbypassable “system benefits” charge which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism see note 12 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about aps’ nuclear decommissioning costs 

  palo verde liability and insurance matters 

see “palo verde nuclear generating station” in note 11 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants including aps for palo verde 

property not held in fee or subject to encumbrances 

  jointlyowned facilities 

aps shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other companies the following table shows aps’ interests in those jointlyowned facilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2005 

 

 

   palo verde leases 

in 1986 aps sold about 42 of its share of palo verde unit 2 and certain common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions aps accounts for these leases as operating leases the leases which have terms of 295 years contain options to renew the leases and to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms see notes 9 and 20 of notes to pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding the palo verde unit 2 sale leaseback transactions 

transmission access 

aps’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5613 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 42 miles of underground lines 5457 miles of which are located within the state of arizona aps’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 12262 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 14430 miles of underground lines all of which are located within the state of arizona

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis 

of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west’s consolidated financial statements and arizona public service company’s financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report 

overview 

pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so customer growth in aps’ service territory is about three times the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings 

the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates the key issue affecting pinnacle west’s and aps’ financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc as discussed in greater detail in note 3 aps has pending before the acc 

 

aps has been operating palo verde unit 1 at reduced power levels since december 25 2005 due to a nonsafety related acoustic impact in one of the unit’s shutdown cooling lines unit 1 is currently operating at approximately 25 power aps has concluded after comprehensive analysis that the preferred solution will require unit 1 to undergo an outage of approximately five weeks in order for aps to effect the necessary modifications to the unit aps anticipates that unit 1 will begin this outage in the june timeframe in addition an outage for preparatory work of approximately one week beginning march 18 2006 will take place prior to this outage this preferred solution was initially planned for installation in the spring of 2007 aps estimates that through february 28 2006 unit 1’s reduced power level has resulted in incremental replacement power costs of approximately 20 million after income taxes approximately 18 million of which has been incurred since january 1 2006 based on current forward market energy prices aps estimates that a operating unit 1 at reduced power levels until the assumed outage in the june timeframe will result in additional incremental replacement power costs of approximately 25 million after income taxes and b the june unit 1 outage will result in additional incremental replacement power costs of approximately 15 million after income taxes aps estimates that these reduced power levels and the june unit 1 outage will result in additional psa deferrals of 50 million after tax 85 million pretax in 2006 see “deferred fuel and purchased power costs” below 

suncor our real estate development subsidiary has been and is expected to be an important source of earnings and cash flow our subsidiary aps energy services provides competitive commodityrelated energy services and energyrelated products and services to commercial and 

industrial retail customers in the western united states el dorado our investment subsidiary owns minority interests in several energyrelated investments and arizona communitybased ventures 

pinnacle west energy is our subsidiary that previously owned and operated unregulated generating plants pursuant to the acc’s april 7 2005 order in aps’ 2003 rate case on july 29 2005 pinnacle west energy transferred the pwec dedicated assets to aps see “aps 2003 rate case” in note 3 pinnacle west energy sold its 75 interest in silverhawk to npc on january 10 2006 as a result pinnacle west energy no longer owns any generating plants and has ceased operations 

we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities in the delivery area we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction we plan to expand longterm resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability 

see “pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook” below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results 

pinnacle west consolidated – earnings contribution by business segment 

we have three principal business segments determined by products services and the regulatory environment 

 

 

the following table summarizes net income for 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars in millions 

 

 

 pinnacle west consolidated — results of operations 

general 

throughout the following explanations of our results of operations we refer to “gross margin” with respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs “gross margin” is a “nongaap financial measure” as defined in accordance with securities and exchange commission rules exhibit 9929 reconciles this nongaap financial measure to operating income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in addition we have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our currentperiod presentation 

sale of silverhawk 

in june 2005 we entered into an agreement to sell our 75 interest in silverhawk to npc as a result of the sale we recorded an aftertax loss from discontinued operations of approximately 56 million in the second quarter of 2005 the marketing and trading segment discontinued operations in the chart above include this loss as well as revenues and expenses related to the operations of silverhawk the sale was completed on january 10 2006 

deferred fuel and purchased power costs 

the settlement of aps’ 2003 general retail rate case became effective april 1 2005 as part of the settlement the acc approved a 42 annual retail rate increase and the psa which provides mechanisms for adjusting rates to reflect variations in fuel and purchased power costs in accordance with the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs net of offsystem sales margins and the amount for such costs currently included in base rates the current base rate for fuel and purchased power costs is based on 2003 price levels and spot prices for natural gas and wholesale power have increased over 40 since then although aps defers actual fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis aps’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual psa adjustments and acc approval of periodic surcharge applications 

actual fuel and purchased power costs are higher than in prior periods primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased plant outage days 

aps’ pretax psa deferrals were approximately 173 million at december 31 2005 based on recent forward market prices for natural gas and purchased power which are subject to change and assuming no interim rate relief aps estimates that its pretax psa deferrals in 2006 will be approximately 240 million to 250 million in january 2006 the acc approved the first annual adjustment under the psa mechanism which is expected to recover approximately 110 million of the 2005 balance of 173 million from retail customers over twelve months beginning february 1 2006 in this same order the acc granted aps the authority to continue to defer fuel costs in excess of the 7762 million annual fuel cost cap established in the 2005 rate order and to seek recovery of those amounts in a future proceeding on february 2 2006 aps filed a request with the acc to recover the remainder of the retail portion of the 2005 deferred fuel balance of 173 million — approximately 60 million — through two surcharges the first surcharge is to recover 15 million over a twelvemonth period proposed to begin with the date of the acc’s decision in aps’ pending emergency interim rate case the second surcharge is to recover approximately 45 million over a twelvemonth period proposed to begin no later than the acc’s completion of its inquiry regarding unplanned 2005 outages at palo verde the 45 million of psa deferrals represents additional replacement power costs associated with these outages see note 3 see “overview” in this item 7 for information about palo verde unit 1 operating at reduced power levels and the related economic impact 

2005 compared with 2004 

our consolidated net income for 2005 was 176 million compared with 243 million for the prior year the currentyear net income included an aftertax net loss from discontinued operations of 47 million compared with a 4 million aftertax loss in the prior year which for both years is related primarily to the sale and operations of silverhawk see “sale of silverhawk” above partially offset by sales of commercial properties at suncor income from continuing operations decreased 24 million in the periodtoperiod comparison reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment 

 

 

 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income are contained in the following table dollars in millions 

 

  regulated electricity segment revenues 

regulated electricity segment revenues were 202 million higher for 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of 

 

  marketing and trading segment revenues 

marketing and trading segment revenues were 49 million lower for 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of 

 

  real estate revenues

  capital expenditure requirements 

the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for the year ended 2005 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 

capital expenditures dollars in millions 

 

 

 distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include lines substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems major transmission projects are driven by strong regional customer growth 

generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear plants the acquisition of the sundance plant and the replacement of palo verde steam generators see below examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately 35 million annually for 2006 through 2008 

replacement of the steam generators at palo verde unit 1 was completed during the fall 2005 outage at a cost to aps of approximately 70 million the palo verde owners have approved the manufacture of one additional set of steam generators these generators will be installed in unit 3 and are scheduled for completion in the fall of 2007 at an approximate cost of 75 million aps’ share approximately 20 million of the unit 3 steam generator costs have been incurred through 2005 with the remaining 55 million included in future years in the capital expenditure table above capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash or external financings 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes pinnacle west’s consolidated contractual requirements as of december 31 2005 dollars in millions 

 

 

   offbalance sheet arrangements 

in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and accordingly do not consolidate them 

aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur under 

certain circumstances for example the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had occurred as of december 31 2005 aps would have been required to assume approximately 234 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately 185 million 

  guarantees and letters of credit 

we and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of credit in support of our unregulated businesses we have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of aps energy services we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to these obligations we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit 

  credit ratings 

the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of march 7 2006 are shown below the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west’s or aps’ securities and serve to increase those companies’ cost of and access to capital it may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments see note 18 

 

  debt provisions 

pinnacle west’s and aps’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include a debt to capitalization ratio certain of aps’ bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements for each of 

pinnacle west and aps these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization cannot exceed 65 at december 31 2005 the ratio was approximately 49 for pinnacle west and 47 for aps the provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps the interest coverage is approximately 4 times under aps’ bank financing agreements as of december 31 2005 failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could crossdefault other debt 

neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade however in the event of a further rating downgrade pinnacle west andor aps may be subject to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements 

all of pinnacle west’s bank agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements all of aps’ bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings

capital needs and resources 

  pinnacle west parent company 

our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our longterm debt on october 19 2005 our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated annual rate of 200 per share from 190 per share effective with the december 1 2005 dividend payment the level of our common dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions 

our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries primarily suncor for the years 2003 through 2005 total dividends from aps were 510 million and total cash contributions from suncor were 243 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash contributions from aps were approximately 170 million and distributions from suncor were approximately 50 million an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and prohibits aps from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold at december 31 2005 aps’ common equity ratio as defined was approximately 54 

at december 31 2005 pinnacle west’s outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was 299 million in december 2005 we replaced the existing revolving credit facility with a 300 million revolving credit facility that terminates in december 2010 this line of credit is available to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit at december 31 2005 we had no commercial paper or shortterm borrowings outstanding we ended 2005 in an invested position 

pinnacle west sponsors a qualified pension plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of the fund assets and our pension obligation the assets in the plan are comprised of common stocks bonds common and collective trusts and shortterm investments future year contribution amounts are dependent on fund performance and fund valuation assumptions we contributed 53 million in 2005 the contribution to our pension plan in 2006 is estimated to be approximately 50 million the expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2006 is estimated to be approximately 29 million aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions aps’ share is approximately 96 of both plans 

on may 2 2005 pinnacle west redeemed at par all of its 165 million floating rate senior notes due november 1 2005 the company used cash on hand to redeem the notes 

on may 2 2005 pinnacle west issued 6095000 shares of its common stock at an offering price of 42 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately 248 million pinnacle west used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including making capital contributions to aps which in turn used a portion of such funds to acquire the sundance plant and fund other capital expenditures to meet the growing needs of aps’ service territory 

on february 28 2006 pinnacle west entered into an uncommitted master shelf agreement with prudential investment management inc “prudential” and certain of its affiliates the agreement provides the terms under which pinnacle west may offer up to 200 million of its senior notes for purchase by prudential affiliates at any time prior to december 31 2007 the maturity of notes issued under the agreement cannot exceed five years pursuant to the agreement on february 28 2006 pinnacle west issued and sold to prudential affiliates 175 million aggregate principal amount of its 591 senior notes series a due february 28 2011 the “series a notes” pinnacle west will use the proceeds of the series a notes to repay at maturity a portion of the 300 million aggregate principal amount of its 640 senior notes due april 1 2006 or for other general corporate purposes

  aps 

aps’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of longterm debt aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external financings aps has historically paid its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 

on january 15 2005 aps repaid its 100 million 625 notes due 2005 aps used cash on hand to redeem these notes 

on march 1 2005 maricopa county arizona pollution control corporation issued 164 million of variable interest rate pollution control bonds 2005 series ae due 2029 the bonds were issued to refinance 164 million of outstanding pollution control bonds the series ae bonds are payable solely from revenues obtained from aps pursuant to a loan agreement between aps and maricopa county arizona pollution control corporation these bonds are classified as longterm debt on our balance sheets 

on may 12 2003 aps issued 500 million of debt and made a 500 million loan to pinnacle west energy pinnacle west energy distributed the net proceeds of that loan to pinnacle west to fund the repayment of a portion of the debt incurred to finance the construction of the pwec dedicated assets on april 11 2005 this loan was repaid with the proceeds of a new debt issuance by pinnacle west energy

aps’ outstanding debt was approximately 26 billion at december 31 2005 in december 2005 aps replaced its 325 million revolving credit facility that would have terminated in may 2007 with a 400 million revolving credit facility that terminates in december 2010 this line of credit is available either to support the issuance of up to 250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings including issuances of letters of credit at december 31 2005 aps had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings aps ended 2005 in an invested position 

although provisions in aps’ articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that aps may issue aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements 

see “deferred fuel and purchased power costs” above and “power supply adjustor” in note 3 for information regarding the psa approved by the acc although aps defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis aps’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual psa adjustments and acc approval of periodic surcharge applications 

see “cash flow hedges” in note 18 for information related to increased collateral provided to us by counterparties

el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 

aps energy services expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

regulatory accounting 

regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates we had 324 million including 173 million related to the psa of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2005 included in the 173 million is approximately 45 million related to the 2005 unplanned palo verde outages which currently are the subject of inquiry by the acc in addition we had 592 million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 

2005 which primarily are related to removal costs see notes 1 and 3 for more information about regulatory assets aps’ general rate case and power supply adjustor 

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting 

changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 

the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2005 projected benefit obligation our december 31 2005 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2005 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december 31 2005 accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and our 2005 reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on pinnacle west’s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 

 

 

 see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

derivative accounting 

derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met for fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 

the fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable in some cases we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions see “market risks – commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 

pinnacle west consolidated – factors affecting our financial outlook 

factors affecting operating revenues fuel and purchased power costs 

  general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states these revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix customer growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity rates and tariffs and variations in weather from period to period competitive sales of energy and energyrelated products and services are made by aps energy services in certain western states that have opened to competition 

  retail rate proceedings the key issue affecting pinnacle west’s and aps’ financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps’ retail rate proceedings pending before the acc as discussed in greater detail in note 3 aps has pending before the acc a general retail rate case an application for an emergency interim rate increase and an application for two separate surcharges under the psa 

  fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance transmission availability or constraints prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service variances in deferrals and amortization of fuel and purchased power beginning on april 1 2005 and our hedging program for managing such costs see “power supply adjustor” in note 3 for information regarding the psa approved by the acc see “natural gas supply” in note 11 for more information on fuel costs see “overview” in this item 7 for information about palo verde unit 1 operating at reduced power levels and the related economic impact 

  customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to native load customers and sales to them customer growth in aps’ service territory averaged about 38 a year for the three years 2003 through 2005 we currently expect customer growth to average about 38 per year from 2006 to 2008 we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will grow 37 on average from 2006 through 2008 before the effects of weather variations customer growth for 2005 was 43 

actual sales growth excluding weatherrelated variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and responses to retail price changes our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatthour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  weather in forecasting retail sales growth we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of 20 million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to 10 million 

  wholesale power market conditions the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps’ risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand the marketing and trading division subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades in electricity fuels and emission allowances and 

credits our future earnings will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market 

other factors affecting financial results 

  operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant additions and operations inflation outages higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 

  depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property which include generation construction or acquisition changes in depreciation and amortization rates see note 1 and changes in regulatory asset amortization see note 7 for information on aps’ acquisition of the sundance plant in 2005 see “purchased power” in part i item 1 of this report for more information on requests for proposal to acquire additional longterm resources in 2006 and 2007 

  property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by tax rates and the value of property inservice and under construction the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 92 of assessed value for 2005 and 2004 we expect property taxes to increase as new power plants the acquisition of the sundance plant and our additions to transmission and distribution facilities are included in the property tax base 

  interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt the primary factors affecting borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital requirements and our internally generated cash flow capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation interest expense is also affected by interest rates on variablerate debt 

  retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory 

  subsidiaries suncor’s net income was 56 million in 2003 45 million in 2004 and 56 million in 2005 see note 22 for further discussion 

aps energy services’ and el dorado’s historical results are not indicative of future performance 

  general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors see “forwardlooking statements” for further information on such factors which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 

market risks 

our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 

  interest rate and equity risk 

our major financial market risk exposure is to changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and interest earned by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 12 our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt the nuclear decommissioning fund also has risk associated with the changing market value of equity investments nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices 

the tables below present contractual balances of our consolidated longterm and shortterm debt at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair value of those instruments on december 31 2005 and 2004 the interest rates presented in the tables below represent the weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2005 and 2004 dollars in thousands

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions allowances we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps our ermc consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities in addition subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ermc we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements 

the marktomarket value of derivative instruments related to our risk management and trading activities are presented in two categories consistent with our business segments

arizona public service company – results of operations 

general 

throughout the following explanations of our results of operations we refer to “gross margin” gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs gross margin is a “nongaap financial measure” as defined in accordance with sec rules exhibit 9930 reconciles this nongaap financial measure to operating income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in addition we have reclassified certain priorperiod amounts to conform to our currentperiod presentation 

deferred fuel and purchased power costs 

the settlement of aps’ 2003 general retail rate case became effective april 1 2005 as part of the settlement the acc approved a 42 annual retail rate increase and the psa which provides mechanisms for adjusting rates to reflect variations in fuel and purchased power costs in accordance with the psa aps defers for future rate recovery 90 of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs net of offsystem sales margins and the amount for such costs currently included in base rates the current base rate for fuel and purchased power costs is based on 2003 price levels and spot prices for natural gas and wholesale power have increased over 40 since then although aps defers actual fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis aps’ recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual psa adjustments and acc approval of periodic surcharge applications 

actual fuel and purchased power costs are higher than in prior periods primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased plant outage days 

aps’ pretax psa deferrals were approximately 173 million at december 31 2005 based on recent forward market prices for natural gas and purchased power which are subject to change and assuming no interim rate relief aps estimates that its pretax psa deferrals in 2006 will be approximately 240 million to 250 million in january 2006 the acc approved the first annual adjustment under the psa mechanism which is expected to recover approximately 110 million of the 2005 balance of 173 million from retail customers over twelve months beginning february 1 2006 in this same order the acc granted aps the authority to continue to defer fuel costs in excess of the 7762 million annual fuel cost cap established in the 2005 rate order and to seek recovery of those amounts in a future proceeding on february 2 2006 aps filed a request with the acc to recover the remainder of the retail portion of the 2005 deferred fuel balance of 173 million — approximately 60 million — through two surcharges the first surcharge is to recover 15 million over a twelvemonth period proposed to begin with the date of the acc’s decision in aps’ pending emergency interim rate case the second surcharge is to recover approximately 45 million over a twelvemonth period proposed to begin no later than the acc’s completion of its inquiry regarding unplanned 2005 outages at palo verde the 45 million of psa deferrals represents additional replacement power costs associated with these outages see note 3 see “overview” in this item 7 for information about palo verde unit 1 operating at reduced power levels and the related economic impact 

2005 compared with 2004 

aps’ net income for 2005 was 170 million compared with 200 million for the prior year the 30 million decrease was primarily due to the regulatory disallowance of plant costs in accordance with the aps retail rate case settlement higher fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to higher prices and more plant outage days higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service costs and higher property taxes due to increased plant in service these negative factors were partially offset by deferred fuel and purchased power costs a retail price increase effective april 1 2005 higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth lower depreciation due to lower depreciation rates lower regulatory asset amortization and effects of weather on retail sales 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income are contained in the following table dollars in millions 

 

regulated electricity revenues 

regulated electricity revenues were 193 million higher for 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of 

 

 

  marketing and trading revenues 

marketing and trading revenues were 120 million lower for 2005 compared with the prioryear period primarily as a result of 

 

2004 compared with 2003 

aps’ net income for 2004 was 200 million compared with 181 million for the prior year the 19 million increase in the periodtoperiod comparison reflects lower regulatory asset amortization the benefit of customer growth decreased purchased power and fuel costs primarily due to lower prices for capacity purchases increased interest income and lower replacement power costs due to fewer unplanned outages these positive factors were partially offset by increased operations and maintenance costs related to increased generation customer service and personnel costs the effects of weather on retail sales higher depreciation and amortization related to increased delivery and other assets lower realized margins on energy trading due to higher wholesale electricity prices a retail electricity price reduction lower income tax credits and higher interest expense primarily due to increased utility plant in service 

additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income for 2004 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table dollars in millions

  testimony the acc staff recommended among other things that the acc decrease aps’ rates by approximately 8 approximately 143 million annually not allow the pwec dedicated assets to be included in aps’ rate base and not allow aps to recover any of the 234 million written off as a result of the 1999 settlement agreement the acc staff recommendations if implemented as proposed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position liquidity dividend sustainability credit ratings and access to capital markets we believe that aps’ rate case requests are supported by among other things aps’ demonstrated need for the pwec dedicated assets aps’ need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in aps’ highgrowth service territory and the conditions in the western energy market as a result we believe it is unlikely that the acc would adopt the acc staff recommendations in their present form although we can give no assurances in that regard the hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin on may 25 2004 we believe the acc will be able to make a decision by the end of 2004 employees at december 31 2003 we employed about 7200 people including the employees of our subsidiaries of these employees about 6000 were employees of aps including employees at jointlyowned generating facilities for which aps serves as the generating facility manager about 1200 people were employed by pinnacle west and our other subsidiaries our principal executive offices are located at 400 north fifth street phoenix arizona 85004 telephone 6022501000 available information we make available free of charge on or through our internet website wwwpinnaclewestcom the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec our annual report on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 the information on our website is not part of this report forwardlooking statements this document contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues except as required by applicable law these forwardlooking statements are often identified by words such as “predict” “hope” “may” “believe” “anticipate” “plan” “expect” “require” “intend” “assume” and similar words because actual results may differ materially from expectations we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements a number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by us these factors include but are not limited to  5 

    regulation and competition retail the acc regulates aps’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west aps and their respective affiliates see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the status of electric industry restructuring in arizona the electric utility industry has undergone significant regulatory change in the last few years designed to encourage competition in the sale of electricity and related services however the experience in california with deregulation has caused many states including arizona to reexamine retail electric competition 6 

  as of january 1 2001 all of aps’ retail customers were eligible to choose an alternate energy supplier however there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory also regulatory developments and legal challenges to the acc’s electric competition rules have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric competition and of electric restructuring in arizona see “retail electric competition rules” in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investorowned utilities in arizona such as tucson electric power company and southwest gas corporation as well as cooperatives municipalities electrical districts and similar types of governmental or nonprofit organizations principally salt river project aps also faces competition from lowcost hydroelectric power and parties that have access to lowpriced preferential federal power and other governmental subsidies in addition some customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate generation facilities to meet their own energy requirements wholesale   general the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services during 2003 approximately 19 of our electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services in early 2003 we moved our marketing and trading division from pinnacle west to aps for all future marketing and trading activities existing wholesale contracts remained at pinnacle west as a result of the acc’s track a order prohibiting the previously required transfer of aps’ generating assets to pinnacle west energy see “track a order” in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps’ purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer energy requirements the division also sells in the wholesale market aps and pinnacle west energy generation output that is not needed for aps’ native load and in doing so competes with other utilities power marketers and independent power producers see “track b order” in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding an accmandated process by which aps must competitively procure energy additionally the marketing and trading division subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades in electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits   regional transmission organizations   federal in a december 1999 order the ferc established characteristics and functions that must be met by utilities in forming and operating rtos the characteristics for an acceptable rto include independence from market participants operational control over a region large enough to support efficient and nondiscriminatory markets and exclusive authority to maintain shortterm reliability additionally in a pending notice of proposed rulemaking the ferc is considering implementing a standard market design for wholesale markets 7

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item 8 of this report overview we own all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a verticallyintegrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of the tucson metropolitan area and about onehalf of the phoenix metropolitan area through its marketing and trading division aps also generates sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western united states aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings growth in aps’ service territory is about three times the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings pinnacle west energy is our unregulated generation subsidiary we formed pinnacle west energy in 1999 as a result of the acc’s requirement that aps transfer all of its competitive assets and services to an affiliate or to a third party by the end of 2002 we planned to transfer aps’ generation assets to pinnacle west energy additionally pinnacle west energy constructed several power plants to meet growing energy needs 1790 mw in arizona and 570 mw in nevada in september 2002 the acc issued the track a order which prohibited aps from transferring its generation assets to pinnacle west energy as a result of the track a order we are seeking to transfer the plants built by pinnacle west energy in arizona to aps to unite the arizona generation under one common owner as originally intended suncor our real estate development subsidiary has been and is expected to be an important source of earnings and cash flow particularly during the years 2003 through 2005 due to accelerated asset sales activity our subsidiary aps energy services provides competitive commodityrelated energy services and energyrelated products and services to commercial industrial and institutional retail customers in the western united states the earnings contributions of our marketing and trading segment significantly decreased over the past two years due to lower market liquidity and deteriorating counterparty credit in the wholesale power markets in the western united states the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps’ purchased power and fuel risks in connection with aps’ costs of serving retail customer energy requirements we currently expect contributions from our trading activities to be negligible for 2004 and approximately 10 million pretax annually thereafter we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities in the generation area 2003 represented the twelfth consecutive year palo verde was the largest power producer in the united states in the delivery area we focus on superior reliability and expanding our transmission and distribution system to meet growth and sustain reliability 27   we believe aps’ general rate case pending before the acc is the key issue affecting our outlook as discussed in greater detail in note 3 in item 8 in this rate case aps has requested among other things a 98 retail rate increase approximately 175 million annually rate treatment for the pwec dedicated assets and the recovery of 234 million written off by aps as part of the 1999 settlement agreement in its filed testimony the acc staff recommended among other things that the acc decrease aps’ rates by approximately 8 approximately 143 million annually not allow the pwec dedicated assets to be included in aps’ rate base and not allow aps to recover any of the 234 million written off as a result of the 1999 settlement agreement the acc staff recommendations if implemented as proposed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position liquidity dividend sustainability credit ratings and access to capital markets we believe that aps’ rate case requests are supported by among other things aps’ demonstrated need for the pwec dedicated assets aps’ need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in aps’ highgrowth service territory and the conditions in the western energy market as a result we believe it is unlikely that the acc would adopt the acc staff recommendations in their present form although we can give no assurances in that regard the hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin on may 25 2004 we believe the acc will be able to make a decision by the end of 2004 other factors affecting our past and future financial results include customer growth purchased power and fuel costs operations and maintenance expenses including those relating to plant outages weather variations depreciation and amortization expenses which are affected by net additions to existing utility plant and other property and changes in regulatory asset amortization and the expected performance of our subsidiaries suncor and el dorado earnings contributions by subsidiary and business segments we have three principal business segments determined by products services and the

needs and resources   capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2003 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years capital expenditures dollars in millions   delivery capital expenditures are comprised of td infrastructure additions and upgrades capital replacements new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs 38   examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include td lines and substations line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems aps completed the southwest valley transmission project in 2003 at a cost of approximately 70 million major transmission projects are driven by strong regional customer growth aps will begin major projects each year for the next several years and expects to spend about 200 million on major transmission projects during the 2004 to 2006 time frame these amounts are included in “apsdelivery” in the table above completion of these projects will stretch from 2005 through at least 2008 generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps’ existing fossil and nuclear plants and the replacement of palo verde steam generators examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines boilers and environmental equipment generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately 30 million annually for 2004 to 2006 replacement of the steam generators in palo verde unit 2 was completed during the fall outage of 2003 at a cost to aps of approximately 70 million the palo verde owners have approved the manufacture of two additional sets of steam generators these generators will be installed in unit 1 scheduled completion in 2005 and unit 3 scheduled completion in 2007 our portion of steam generator expenditures for units 1 and 3 is approximately 140 million which will be spent through 2008 in 2004 through 2006 approximately 90 million of the unit 1 and unit 3 costs are included in the generation capital expenditures table above and will be funded with internallygenerated cash or external financings   contractual obligations the following table summarizes contractual requirements as of december 31 2003 dollars in millions  39      offbalance sheet arrangements in 2003 we adopted fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” as it applies to specialpurpose entities fin no 46r requires that we consolidate a vie if we have a majority of the risk of loss from the vie’s activities or we are entitled to receive a majority of the vie’s residual returns or both a vie is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate spe lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap see note 9 for further information about the sale leaseback transactions based on our assessment of fin no 46r we are not required to consolidate the palo verde vies certain provisions of fin no 46r have a future effective date we do not expect these provisions to have a material impact on our financial statements aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur under certain circumstances for example the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had occurred as of december 31 2003 aps would have been required to assume approximately 268 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately 200 million   guarantees and letters of credit we and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of credit in support of our unregulated businesses we have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of aps energy services we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to these obligations see note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit   credit ratings the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of march 11 2004 are shown below and are considered to be “investmentgrade” ratings the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market 40   price of pinnacle west’s or aps’ securities and serve to increase those companies’ cost of and access to capital it may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments see note 18    debt provisions pinnacle west’s and aps’ debt covenants related to their respective financing arrangements include a debttototalcapitalization ratio and an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet the covenant requirement levels the ratio of debt to total capitalization cannot exceed 65 for each of the company and aps individually at december 31 2003 the ratio was approximately 54 for pinnacle west at december 31 2003 the ratio was approximately 53 for aps the provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for each of the company and aps based on 2003 results the coverages were approximately 4 times for the company 4 times for the aps bank financing agreements and 15 times for the aps mortgage indenture failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants neither pinnacle west’s nor aps’ financing agreements contain “ratings triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade however in the event of a ratings downgrade pinnacle west andor aps may be subject to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements all of pinnacle west’s bank agreements contain “crossdefault” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under other agreements all of aps’ bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under other agreements pinnacle west’s and aps’ credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in financial condition or financial prospects 41   capital needs and resources by company   pinnacle west parent company our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders interest payments and optional and mandatory repayments of principal on our longterm debt see the table above for our contractual requirements including our debt repayment obligations but excluding optional repayments and equity infusions into our subsidiaries primarily pinnacle west energy on october 22 2003 our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated annual rate of 180 per share from 170 per share effective with the december 1 2003 dividend payment the level of our common dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries primarily suncor for the years 2001 through 2003 total dividends from aps were 510 million and total distributions from suncor were 121 million for the year ended december 31 2003 dividends from aps were approximately 170 million and distributions from suncor were approximately 108 million we expect suncor to make cash distributions to the parent company of 80 to 100 million annually in 2004 and 2005 due to anticipated accelerated asset sales activity as discussed in note 3 under “acc financing orders” aps must maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 and may not pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold as defined in the financing order common equity ratio is common equity divided by common equity plus longterm debt including current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2003 aps’ common equity ratio was approximately 46 on may 12 2003 aps issued 500 million of debt as follows 300 million aggregate principal amount of its 465 notes due 2015 and 200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5625 notes due 2033 also on may 12 2003 aps made a 500 million loan to pinnacle west energy and pinnacle west energy distributed the net proceeds of that loan to us to fund our repayment of a portion of the debt incurred to finance the construction of the pwec dedicated assets see “acc financing order” in note 3 for additional information with pinnacle west energy’s distribution to us on may 12 2003 we repaid the outstanding balance 167 million under a credit facility we used a portion of the remaining proceeds to redeem our 250 million floating rate notes due 2003 on june 2 2003 and to repay other shortterm debt on november 12 2003 we issued 165 million of our floating rate senior notes due 2005 at december 31 2003 the parent company’s outstanding longterm debt including current maturities was 681 million at december 31 2003 we had unused credit commitments from various banks totaling 275 million which were available to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings at december 31 2003 we had no commercial paper outstanding and no shortterm borrowings we ended 2003 in an invested position pinnacle west sponsors a pension plan that covers employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of the fund assets and our pension obligation we elected to contribute cash to our pension plan in each of the last five years our minimum required contributions during each of 42   those years was zero specifically we contributed 73 million for 2002 46 million of which was contributed in june 2003 24 million for 2001 44 million for 2000 20 million of which was contributed in 2001 and 25 million for 1999 aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the pension contribution of which aps represents approximately 89 of the total funding amounts described above the assets in the plan are mostly domestic common stocks bonds and real estate future year contribution amounts are dependent on fund performance and fund valuation assumptions under current law we are required to contribute approximately 100 million to our pension plans in 2004 and expect to contribute approximately 50 million to our other postretirement benefit plan in 2004 if currently pending legislation is enacted our required pension contribution in 2004 would decrease to the 25 to 50 million range   aps aps’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of longterm debt see “pinnacle west parent company” above and note 3 for discussion of the 500 million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west energy approved by the acc in 2003 and discussion of a 125 million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and to the extent necessary external financings aps has historically paid for its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations see “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west on april 7 2003 aps redeemed approximately 33 million of its first mortgage bonds 8 series due 2025 and on august 1 2003 aps redeemed approximately 54 million of its first mortgage bonds 725 series due 2023 on february 15 2004 125 million of aps 5875 notes due 2004 were redeemed at maturity and on march 1 2004 80 million of aps’ first mortgage bonds 6625 series due 2004 were redeemed at maturity aps used cash from operations and shortterm debt to redeem the maturing debt aps’ outstanding debt was approximately 26 billion at december 31 2003 at december 31 2003 aps had unused credit commitments from various banks totaling about 250 million which were available either to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings at december 31 2003 aps had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings aps ended 2003 in an invested position although provisions in aps’ first mortgage bond indenture articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of additional first mortgage bonds debt and preferred stock that aps may issue aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements   pinnacle west energy the costs of pinnacle west energy’s construction of 2360 mw of generating capacity from 2000 through 2004 are expected to be about 14 billion of which 135 billion has been incurred 43   through december 31 2003 this does not reflect the proceeds from an anticipated sale in 2004 to snwa of a 25 interest in the 570 mw silverhawk combined cycle plant 20 miles north of las vegas nevada which would equal about 100 million plus capitalized interest of pinnacle west energy’s cumulative capital expenditures in the project snwa has agreed to purchase a 25 interest in the project upon completion such purchase is subject to an appropriation of funds by snwa pinnacle west energy’s capital requirements are currently funded through capital infusions from pinnacle west which finances those infusions through debt and equity financings and internallygenerated cash see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures in 2003 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years see note 3 and “pinnacle west parent company” above for a discussion of the 500 million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west energy authorized by the acc pursuant to the financing order   other subsidiaries during the past three years suncor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings suncor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures in 2003 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years suncor expects to fund its capital requirements with cash from operations and external financings in 2003 suncor acquired or issued 10 million in longterm debt and redeemed refinanced or repaid 1 million in longterm debt see note 6 suncor’s outstanding long and shortterm debt was approximately 104 million as of december 31 2003 suncor’s total shortterm debt was 86 million at december 31 2003 suncor had a 120 million line of credit under which 50 million of shortterm borrowings were outstanding at december 31 2003 suncor’s longterm debt including current maturities totaled 18 million at december 31 2003 we expect suncor to make cash distributions to the parent company of 80 to 100 million annually in 2004 and 2005 due to anticipated accelerated asset sales activity el dorado funded its cash requirements during the past three years primarily for nac in 2002 with cash infused by the parent company and with cash from operations el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments aps energy services’ cash requirements during the past three years were funded with cash infusions from the parent company and with cash from operations see the capital expenditures table above regarding aps energy services’ actual capital expenditures for 2003 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues 44   expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had 165 million of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 see notes 1 and 3 for more information about regulatory assets and aps’ general rate case pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the 2003 projected benefit obligation our 2003 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2003 reported pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on our consolidated statements of income dollars in millions   the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the 2003 accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and our 2003 45   reported other postretirement benefit expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants on our consolidated statements of income dollars in millions   see note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts will determine whether we use accrual accounting or fair value marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that changes in fair value be recorded in earnings or if certain hedge accounting criteria are met in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss see “market risks  commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting marktomarket accounting the market value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable in some cases we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions see “market risks  commodity price risk” below for quantitative analysis see note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 46   other accounting matters accounting for derivative and trading activities we adopted eitf 0311 effective october 1 2003 eitf 0311 provides guidance on whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net or gross basis and concluded such classification is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances in the electricity business some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy this is called “bookout” and usually occurs in contracts that have the same terms quantities and delivery points and for which power does not flow we netted these bookouts reducing both revenues and purchased power and fuel costs in 2003 2002 and 2001 but this did not impact our financial condition net income or cash flows we adopted eitf 023 in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a 66 million aftertax charge in net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated unrealized marktomarket on energy trading contracts that did not meet the accounting definition of a derivative our energy trading contracts that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value under sfas no 133 contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received in 2001 we adopted sfas no 133 and recorded a 15 million aftertax charge in net income and a 72 million aftertax credit in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income both as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 18 for further information on accounting for derivatives asset retirement obligations on january 1 2003 we adopted sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” the standard requires the fair value of asset retirement obligations to be recorded as a liability along with an offsetting plant asset when the obligation is incurred accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the longlived asset see note 1 for more information regarding our previous accounting for removal costs we determined that we have asset retirement obligations for our nuclear facilities nuclear decommissioning and certain other generation transmission and distribution assets on january 1 2003 we recorded a liability of 219 million for our asset retirement obligations including the accretion impacts a 67 million increase in the carrying amount of the associated assets and a net reduction of 192 million in accumulated depreciation related primarily to the reversal of previously recorded accumulated decommissioning and other removal costs related to these obligations additionally we recorded a regulatory liability of 40 million for our asset retirement obligations related to our regulated utility this regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount currently being recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated under sfas no 143 we believe we can recover in regulated rates the transition costs and ongoing current period costs calculated in accordance with sfas no 71 “accounting for the effects of certain types of 47   regulation” see note 1 and sfas no 143 see note 12 adopting sfas no 143 had no impact on our consolidated statements of income or our consolidated statements of cash flow variable interest entities see “liquidity and capital resources  offbalance sheet arrangements” and note 20 for discussion of vies factors affecting our financial outlook aps general rate case we believe aps’ general rate case pending before the acc is the key issue affecting our outlook as discussed in greater detail in note 3 in this rate case aps has requested among other things a 98 retail rate increase approximately 175 million annually rate treatment for the pwec dedicated assets and the recovery of 234 million written off by aps as part of the 1999 settlement agreement in its filed testimony the acc staff recommended among other things that the acc decrease aps’ rates by approximately 8 approximately 143 million annually not allow the pwec dedicated assets to be included in aps’ rate base and not allow aps to recover any of the 234 million written off as a result of the 1999 settlement agreement the acc staff recommendations if implemented as proposed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position liquidity dividend sustainability credit ratings and access to capital markets we believe that aps’ rate case requests are supported by among other things aps’ demonstrated need for the pwec dedicated assets aps’ need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in aps’ highgrowth service territory and the conditions in the western energy market as a result we believe it is unlikely that the acc would adopt the acc staff recommendations in their present form although we can give no assurances in that regard the hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin on may 25 2004 we believe the acc will be able to make a decision by the end of 2004 wholesale power market conditions the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps’ purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer demand we moved this division to aps in early 2003 for future marketing and trading activities existing wholesale contracts remained at pinnacle west as a result of the acc’s track a order prohibiting aps’ transfer of generating assets to pinnacle west energy additionally the marketing and trading division subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades in electricity fuels and emission allowances and credits our future earnings will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market the market has suffered a substantial reduction in overall liquidity because there are fewer creditworthy counterparties and because several key participants have exited the market or scaled back their activities based on the erosion in the market and on the market outlook we currently expect contributions from our trading activities to be negligible for 2004 and approximately 10 million pretax annually thereafter generation construction program see “liquidity and capital resources  pinnacle west energy” for information regarding pinnacle west energy’s generation construction program which is nearing completion the 48   additional generation is expected to increase revenues fuel expenses operating expenses and financing costs   factors affecting operating revenues   general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states these revenues are expected to be affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix customer growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity prices and variations in weather from period to period competitive sales of energy and energyrelated products and services are made by aps energy services in western states that have opened to competitive supply   customer growth customer growth in aps’ service territory averaged about 34 a year for the three years 2001 through 2003 we currently expect customer growth to average about 35 per year from 2004 to 2006 we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will grow 49 on average from 2004 through 2006 before the retail effects of weather variations the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to native load customers customer growth for the year ended december 31 2003 compared with the prior year period was 33   retail rate changes as part of the 1999 settlement agreement aps agreed to a series of annual retail electricity price reductions of 15 on july 1 for each of the years 1999 to 2003 for a total of 75 the final price reduction was implemented july 1 2003 see “1999 settlement agreement” in note 3 for further information in addition the company has requested a 98 retail rate increase to be effective july 1 2004 see “aps general rate case and retail rate adjustment mechanisms” in note 3 for further information   other factors affecting future financial results   purchased power and fuel costs purchased power and fuel costs are impacted by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel our power plant performance prevailing market prices new generating plants being placed in service and our hedging program for managing such costs see “natural gas supply” in note 11 for more information on fuel costs   operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth power plant additions and operations inflation outages higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors   depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to existing utility plant and other property changes in regulatory asset amortization and our generation construction program west phoenix unit 4 was placed in service in june 2001 redhawk units 1 and 2 and the new saguaro unit 3 began commercial operations in july 2002 west phoenix unit 5 was placed in service in july 2003 and silverhawk is expected to be in service in mid2004 the regulatory assets to be recovered under the 1999 settlement agreement are currently being amortized as follows dollars in millions 49      property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes which are affected by tax rates and the value of property inservice and under construction the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns the majority of our property was 93 of assessed value for 2003 and 97 for 2002 we expect property taxes to increase primarily due to our generation construction program as the plants phasein to the property tax base over a fiveyear period and our additions to existing facilities   interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt the primary factors affecting borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital requirements and our internally generated cash flow capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation as noted above we placed new power plants in commercial operation in 2001 2002 and 2003 and we expect to bring an additional plant online in 2004 interest expense is also affected by interest rates on variablerate debt and interest rates on the refinancing of the company’s future liquidity needs in addition see note 1 for a discussion of afudc   retail competition the regulatory developments and legal challenges to the rules discussed in note 3 have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric competition and of electric restructuring in arizona although some very limited retail competition existed in aps’ service area in 1999 and 2000 there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps’ customers as a result we cannot predict when and the extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps’ service territory   subsidiaries in the case of suncor efforts to accelerate asset sales activities in 2003 were successful a portion of these sales have been and additional amounts may be required to be reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of income the annual earnings contribution from suncor was 56 million after tax in 2003 see note 22 for further discussion we anticipate suncor’s annual earnings contributions in 2004 and 2005 will be in the 3040 million range after tax the annual earnings contribution from aps energy services is expected to be positive over the next several years due primarily to a number of retail electricity contracts in california aps energy services had after tax earnings of 16 million in 2003 we expect suncor and aps energy services to have combined earnings of approximately 10 million per year after tax beyond 2005 el dorado’s historical results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for el dorado in addition we do not currently expect material losses related to nac in the future   general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors see “forwardlooking statements” below for further information on such factors which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 50   market risks our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and investments held by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and our pension plans   interest rate and equity risk our major financial market risk exposure is changing interest rates changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and interest earned by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 12 our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt on january 29 2004 we entered into a fixedforfloating interest rate swap transaction see note 6 for additional information the nuclear decommissioning fund also has risk associated with changing market values of

and overthecounter forwards options and swaps our ermc consisting of officers and key management personnel oversees companywide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies as part of our risk management program we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities in addition subject to specified

overview of arizona regulatory developments

     as discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations  factors affecting our financial outlook
in item 7 we believe pending arizona regulatory matters are among the key
factors affecting our financial outlook

     general

     on september 21 1999 the acc approved rules that provided a framework for
the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona on september 23
1999 the acc approved a comprehensive settlement agreement among aps and
various parties related to the implementation of retail electric competition in
arizona under the rules as modified by the 1999 settlement agreement aps was
required to transfer all of its competitive electric assets and services to an
unaffiliated party or parties or to a separate corporate affiliate or affiliates
no later than december 31 2002 consistent with that requirement aps had been
addressing the legal and regulatory requirements necessary to complete the
transfer of its generation assets to pinnacle west energy on or before that

                                       5

date on september 10 2002 the acc issued the track a order which among
other things directed aps not to transfer its generation assets to pinnacle
west energy see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8
for additional information about the 1999 settlement agreement the rules
including legal challenges to the rules and the track a order

     aps financing application

     on september 16 2002 aps filed an application with the acc requesting the
acc to allow aps to borrow up to 500 million and to lend the proceeds to
pinnacle west energy or to the company to guarantee up to 500 million of
pinnacle west energys or the companys debt or a combination of both not to
exceed 500 million in the aggregate in its application aps stated that the
accs reversal of the generation asset transfer requirement and the resulting
bifurcation of generation assets between aps and pinnacle west energy under
different regulatory regimes result in pinnacle west energy being unable to
attain investmentgrade credit ratings this in turn precludes pinnacle west
energy from accessing capital markets to refinance the bridge financing that we
provided to fund the construction of pinnacle west energy generation assets or
from effectively competing in the wholesale markets on march 27 2003 the acc
authorized aps to lend up to 500 million to pinnacle west energy guarantee up
to 500 million of pinnacle west energy debt or a combination of both not to
exceed 500 million in the aggregate see acc applications in note 3 of notes
to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information

     competitive procurement process

     on september 10 2002 the acc issued an order that among other things
established a requirement that aps competitively procure certain power
requirements on march 14 2003 the acc issued the track b order which
documented the decision made by the acc at its open meeting on february 27
2003 addressing this requirement under the order aps will be required to
solicit bids for certain estimated capacity and energy requirements for periods
beginning july 1 2003 for 2003 aps will be required to solicit competitive
bids for about 2500 mw of capacity and about 4600 gigawatthours of energy or
approximately 20 of aps total retail energy requirements the bid amounts are
expected to increase in 2004 and 2005 based largely on growth in aps retail
load and aps retail energy sales the track b order also confirmed that it was
not intended to change the current rate base status of aps existing assets
the order recognizes aps right to reject any bids that are unreasonable
uneconomical or unreliable

     aps expects to issue requests for proposals in march 2003 and to complete
the selection process by june 1 2003 pinnacle west energy will be eligible to
bid to supply aps electricity requirements see track b order in note 3 of
notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information

     aps general rate case

     as required by the 1999 settlement agreement on or before june 30 2003
aps will file a general rate case with the acc in this rate case aps will
update its cost of service and rate design in addition aps expects to seek

                                       6

         recovery of the 234 million pretax asset writeoff recorded by aps as
          a result of the 1999 settlement agreement and

         recovery of costs incurred by aps in preparation for the previously
          required transfer of generation assets to pinnacle west energy

we assume that the acc will make a decision in this general rate case by the end
of 2004

retail

     the acc regulates aps retail electric rates and its issuance of
securities the acc must also approve any transfer of aps utility property and
certain transactions between aps and affiliated parties see managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
factors affecting our financial outlook in item 7 and note 3 of notes to
consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the status of
electric industry restructuring in arizona

     aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other utilities in
arizona such as tucson electric power company southwest gas corporation and
citizens communications company as well as cooperatives municipalities
electrical districts and similar types of governmental organizations
principally salt river project aps also faces competition from lowcost
hydroelectric power and parties that have access to lowpriced preferential
federal power and other subsidies in addition some customers particularly
industrial and large commercial customers may own and operate facilities to
generate their own electric energy requirements although some very limited
retail competition existed in aps service area in 1999 and 2000 there are
currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other
utility services to aps customers as a result we cannot predict when and the
extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps service territory as
competition in the electric industry continues to evolve we will continue to
evaluate strategies and alternatives that will position us to compete
effectively in a restructured industry

wholesale

     general

     the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission
services during 2002 approximately 20 of our electric operating revenues
resulted from such sales and services in early 2003 we moved our marketing and
trading division from pinnacle west to aps for all future marketing and trading
activities existing wholesale contracts will remain at pinnacle west as a
result of the accs track a order prohibiting the previously required transfer
of aps generating assets to pinnacle west energy see overview of arizona
regulatory developments above the marketing and trading division sells in
the wholesale market aps and pinnacle west energy generation output that is not
needed for aps native load and in doing so competes with other utilities
power marketers and independent power producers the division focuses primarily
on managing aps purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of
serving retail customer energy requirements see track b order in note 3 of

     regional transmission organizations

     on december 20 1999 the ferc issued its order no 2000 regarding regional
transmission organizations in its order the ferc set minimum characteristics
and functions that must be met by utilities that participate in rtos the
characteristics for an acceptable rto include independence from market

                                       8
page
participants operational control over a region large enough to support
efficient and nondiscriminatory markets and exclusive authority to maintain
shortterm reliability

     as stated in order no 2000 the ferc believes that a number of benefits
will result from the formation of rtos throughout the country and it has moved
aggressively to ensure that all public utilities participate in an rto or
demonstrate why such participation is not feasible according to the ferc the
benefits it expects to result from rto formation include 1 improvements in
transmission system operations with resulting enhancements to interregional
trade congestion management reliability and coordination and 2 improved
performance of energy markets including greater incentives for efficient
generator performance and enhanced potential for demand response

     on october 16 2001 aps and other owners of electric transmission lines in
the southwest filed with the ferc a request for a declaratory order confirming
that their proposal to form westconnect rto llc would satisfy the fercs
requirements for the formation of an rto aps and the other filing parties have
agreed to fund the startup of westconnects operations which are subject to
ferc approval westconnect has been structured as a forprofit rto and evolved
from desertstar a notforprofit corporation in which aps participated which
was originally designed to serve as an rto for the southwestern united states
the success of westconnect will be largely dependent on participation by all
major transmission owners in the southwest the success is also dependent on
support from the affected state regulatory commissions

     on october 10 2002 the ferc issued an order finding that the westconnect
proposal if modified to address specified issues could meet the fercs rto
requirements and provide the basic framework for a standard market design for
the southwest in its order the ferc also stated that its approval of various
westconnect provisions addressed in the order would not be overturned or
affected by the final rule the ferc intends to ultimately adopt in response to
its july 31 2002 notice of proposed rulemaking regarding a standard market
design for the electric utility industry see federal in note 3 of notes to
consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding
the notice of proposed rulemaking on november 12 2002 aps and other owners
filed a request for rehearing and clarification on portions of the october 10
2002 order

     on december 23 2002 the ferc issued its order on rehearing in it the
ferc clarified the rto elements that it had approved in its order the ferc
stated that it envisions the seams steering group  western interconnection
ssgwi as the entity that will facilitate a common market design for the west
the ssgwi consists of western transmission owners including members of
westconnect the ferc also noted that its prior westconnect order did not
address other elements of market design that are currently being considered in
the pending smd proposal andor through the ssgwi process the ferc clarified
that there are only three areas that would be subject to the final smd rule 1
transmission credits 2 resource adequacy and 3 market monitoring

     the order also stated that the fercs approval of the forprofit structure
will not predetermine its decision in the final smd rule regarding whether a
forprofit independent transmission company should be permitted to perform all
the functions of an independent transmission provider to the extent that the
ferc has not addressed aspects of westconnects forprofit proposal or
westconnects proposed particular functions such elements will be subject to
review for consistency with order no 2000 and other related decisions regarding

                                       9
page
functions that may be performed by an independent transmission company the
westconnect applicants sought further clarification of that aspect of the
rehearing order the ferc has indicated that it will issue an order on the
westconnect applicants motion for clarification before april 14 2003

     the acc rules also required the formation and implementation of an arizona
independent scheduling administrator the purpose of the aisa is to oversee the
application of operating protocols to ensure statewide consistency for
transmission access the aisa is anticipated to be a temporary organization
until the implementation of an independent system operator or rto aps
participated in the creation of the aisa a notforprofit entity and the
filing at the ferc for approval of its operating protocols the operating
protocols were partially rejected and the remainder are currently under review
on february 8 2002 the accs chief alj issued a procedural order which
consolidated the acc docket relating to the aisa with several other pending acc
dockets in its track b order the acc directed that a hearing be held on
whether or not aps should be required to continue funding the aisa

     in a pending ferc proceeding el paso natural gas company has proposed
allocating its gas pipeline capacity in such a way that the gas transportation
rights of aps and pinnacle west energy and other companies with the same
contract type could be significantly impacted various parties including aps
and pinnacle west energy have challenged this allocation as being inconsistent
with el paso natural gas companys existing contractual obligations and a 1996
settlement on may 31 2002 the ferc issued an order requiring the conversion

november 1 2002 to may 1 2003 and approving the reallocation of costs for the
transportation service aps and other full requirements contract holders have
sought rehearings of this ferc order the ferc has indicated that it intends to
issue an order on the merits in this proceeding by april 14 2003 although we
cannot predict the outcome of this matter we currently do not expect this
matter to have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of
operations or liquidity we are continuing to analyze the market to determine
the most favorable source and method of meeting our natural gas requirements

     nuclear fuel supply

     palo verde fuel cycle palo verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50
miles west of phoenix arizona it is a jointlyowned facility operated by aps
the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages

         mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates
         conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride
         enrichment of uranium hexafluoride
         fabrication of fuel assemblies
         utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and
         storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel

     the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verdes
requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2008
except for a small percentage of 2003 uranium concentrates and 2004 conversion
requirements that will be obtained under contracts currently being finalized
the palo verde participants have also contracted for all of palo verdes
enrichment services through 2010 and fuel assembly fabrication services until at
least 2015

     spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal nuclear power plant operators are
required to enter into spent nuclear fuel disposal contracts with the doe and
the doe is required to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other
highlevel radioactive wastes generated by domestic power reactors although the
nuclear waste act required the doe to develop a permanent repository for the
storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel by 1998 the doe has announced that
the repository cannot be completed before 2010 and that it does not intend to
begin accepting spent nuclear fuel prior to that date in november 1997 the
united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc
circuit issued a decision preventing the doe from excusing its own delay but
refused to order the doe to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel based on this
decision and the does delay a number of utilities filed damages lawsuits
against the doe in the court of federal claims

     in february 2002 the us secretary of energy recommended to president
bush that the yucca mountain nevada site be developed as a permanent repository
for spent nuclear fuel the president transmitted this recommendation to
congress and the state of nevada vetoed the presidents recommendation in july
2002 congress approved the development of the yucca mountain nevada site
overriding the nevada veto it is now expected that the doe will submit a

                                       12
page
license application to the nrc late in 2004 the state of nevada has filed
several lawsuits relating to the yucca mountain site we cannot currently
predict what further steps will be taken in this area

     facility funding is a further complication while all nuclear utilities pay
an amount calculated on the basis of the output of their respective plants into
a socalled nuclear waste fund the annual congressional appropriations for the
permanent repository have been for amounts less than the amounts paid into the
waste fund the balance of which is being used for other purposes

     aps has existing fuel storage pools at palo verde and has completed a new
facility for onsite dry storage of spent nuclear fuel with the existing
storage pools and the addition of the new facility aps believes that spent
nuclear fuel storage or disposal methods will be available for use by palo verde
to allow its continued operation through the term of the operating license for
each palo verde unit see palo verde nuclear generating station in note 11 of
notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of interim
spent nuclear fuel storage costs

     although some lowlevel waste has been stored onsite in a lowlevel waste
facility aps is currently shipping lowlevel waste to offsite facilities aps
currently believes that interim lowlevel waste storage methods are or will be
available for use by palo verde to allow its continued operation and to safely
store lowlevel waste until a permanent disposal facility is available

     aps believes that scientific and financial aspects of the issues of spent
nuclear fuel and lowlevel waste storage and disposal can be resolved
satisfactorily however aps acknowledges that their ultimate resolution in a
timely fashion will require political resolve and action on national and
regional scales which aps is less able to predict aps expects to vigorously
protect and pursue its rights related to this matter

purchased power agreements

     in addition to that available from its own generating capacity see
properties in item 2 aps purchases electricity under various arrangements
one of the most important of these is a longterm contract with salt river
project the amount of electricity available to aps is based in large part on
customer demand within certain areas now served by aps pursuant to a related
territorial agreement the generating capacity available to aps pursuant to the
contract was 336 mw from january through may 2002 and starting in june 2002 it
changed to 343 mw in 2002 aps received approximately 1104973 mwh of energy
under the contract and paid about 462 million for capacity availability and
energy received this contract may be canceled by salt river project on three
years notice given no earlier than december 31 2003 aps may also cancel the
contract on five years notice given no earlier than december 31 2006

     in september 1990 aps entered into a thirtyyear seasonal capacity
exchange agreement with pacificorp under this agreement aps receives
electricity from pacificorp during the summer peak season from may 15 to
september 15 and aps returns electricity to pacificorp during the winter season
from october 15 to february 15 until 2020 aps and pacificorp each has 480 mw
of capacity and a related amount of energy available to it under the agreement
for its respective seasons in 2002 aps received approximately 571392 mwh of
energy under the capacity exchange aps must also make additional offers of
energy to pacificorp each year through october 31 2020 pursuant to this
requirement during 2002 pacificorp received offers of 1129600 mwh and
purchased about 115750 mwh

construction program

     during the years 2000 through 2002 aps incurred approximately 14 billion
in capital expenditures aps capital expenditures for the years 2003 through
2005 are expected to be primarily for expanding transmission and distribution
capabilities to meet growing customer needs for upgrading existing utility
property and for environmental purposes aps capital expenditures were
approximately 501 million in 2002 aps capital expenditures including
expenditures for environmental control facilities for the years 2003 through
2005 have been estimated as follows

                              dollars in millions

mortgage replacement fund requirements

     so long as any of its first mortgage bonds are outstanding aps is required
for each calendar year to deposit with the trustee under its mortgage cash in a
formularized amount related to net additions to its mortgaged utility plant aps
may satisfy all or any part of this replacement fund requirement by using
redeemed or retired bonds net property additions or property retirements for
2002 the replacement fund requirement amounted to approximately 161 million
certain of the bonds aps has issued under the mortgage that are callable prior
to maturity are redeemable at their par value plus accrued interest with cash
aps deposits in the replacement fund these call provisions are subject in many
cases to a period of time after the original issuance of the bonds during which
they may not be redeemed in this manner see note 6 of notes to consolidated
financial statements in item 8 for information regarding aps first mortgage
bonds

environmental matters

     epa environmental regulation

     clean air act we are subject to a number of requirements under the clean
air act the clean air act addresses among other things

         acid rain
         visibility in certain specified areas
         hazardous air pollutants and

                                       14
page
         areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards

     with respect to acid rain the clean air act established a system of
sulfur dioxide emissions allowances to offset each ton of sulfur dioxide
emitted by affected power plants based on epa allowance allocations we will
have sufficient allowances to permit continued operation of our plants at
current levels without installing additional equipment the clean air act also
requires the epa to set nitrogen oxides emissions limitations for certain
coalfired units the epa rule allows emissions from all units in a plant to be
averaged to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation currently
nitrogen oxides emissions from all of our units are within the limitations
specified under the epas rules we do not currently expect this rule to have a
material impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity

     the clean air act required the epa to establish a grand canyon visibility
transport commission to complete a study on visibility impairment in sixteen
class i areas large national parks and wilderness areas on the colorado
plateau the navajo generating station cholla and four corners are located near
several class i areas on the colorado plateau the visibility commission
completed its study and on june 10 1996 submitted its final recommendations to
the epa

     on april 22 1999 the epa announced final regional haze rules these new
regulations require states to submit by 2008 implementation plans to eliminate
all manmade emissions causing visibility impairment in certain specified areas
including class i areas in the colorado plateau the 2008 implementation plans
must also include consideration and potential application of best available
retrofit technology for major stationary sources which came into operation
between august 1962 and august 1977 such as the navajo generating station
cholla and four corners

     the rules allow the nine western states and tribes that participated in the
visibility commission process to follow an alternate implementation plan and
schedule for the class i areas considered by the visibility commission under
this option those states and tribes would submit implementation plans by 2003
which would incorporate certain regional sulfur dioxide emissions milestones for
the years 2003 2008 2013 and 2018 which include the application of best
available retrofit technology if the regional emissions in those years were
within those milestones there would be no further emission reduction
requirements and if they were exceeded then an emission trading program would
be implemented to maintain the emissions within those milestones

     the epa reviewed an annex to the visibility commission recommendations
that specify the regional sulfur dioxide emission milestones on april 26 2002
the epa proposed to accept the visibility commissions annex which had been
submitted by the western regional air partnership successor to visibility
commission in september 2000 the annex specifies regional sulfur dioxide
emission reduction milestones the epas final approval of the annex would allow
the states and tribes to pursue the alternate implementation of the regional
haze rules through 2018 any states and tribes that implement this option would
have to submit state implementation plans by 2003 to address visibility in areas
identified in the process and revised implementation plans in 2008 to address
class i areas which were not included in the process the state of arizona is in
the process of developing a state implementation plan to implement the
provisions of the annex because four corners is located on the navajo
reservation and is currently regulated by epa region ix the provisions of the
annex currently could become applicable to four corners only through a federal
implementation plan promulgated by epa region ix at this time it is uncertain

                                       15
page
how the state of arizona andor epa region ix will proceed to implement the
annex so the actual impact on aps cannot yet be determined

     in july 1997 the epa promulgated final national ambient air quality
standards for ozone and particulate matter pursuant to these rules the ozone
standard is more stringent and a new ambient standard for very fine particles
has been established congress has enacted legislation that could delay the
implementation of regional haze requirements and the particulate matter ambient
standard however the legislation does not preclude the visibility commission
states and tribes from implementing the alternate regional haze rules discussed
above because the actual level of emissions controls if any for any unit
cannot be determined at this time aps currently cannot estimate the capital
expenditures if any which would result from the final rules however aps does
not currently expect these rules to have a material adverse effect on its
financial position results of operations or liquidity

     with respect to hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam
generating units the epa has determined that mercury emissions and other
hazardous air pollutants from coal and oilfired power plants will be regulated
we expect that the epa will propose specific rules for this purpose in 2003 and
finalize them by 2004 with compliance required by 2008 because the ultimate
requirements that the epa may impose are not yet known we cannot currently
estimate the capital expenditures if any which may be required

     certain aspects of the clean air act may require aps to make related
expenditures such as permit fees aps does not expect any of these expenditures
to have a material impact on its financial position results of operations or
liquidity

     federal implementation plan in september 1999 the epa proposed a fip to
set air quality standards at certain power plants including the navajo
generating station and four corners the comment period on this proposal ended
in november 1999 the fip is similar to current arizona regulation of the navajo
generating station and new mexico regulation of four corners with minor
modifications aps does not currently expect the fip to have a material impact
on its financial position results of operations or liquidity

     superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous
substances found contaminating the soil water or air those who generated
transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among
those who are potentially responsible parties prps may be strictly and often
jointly and severally liable for cleanup the epa had previously advised aps
that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the indian bend wash superfund site
south area aps ocotillo power plant is located in this area based on the
information to date including available insurance coverage and an epa estimate
of cleanup costs aps does not expect this matter to have a material impact on
its financial position results of operations or liquidity

     manufactured gas plant sites aps is currently investigating properties
which it now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate
predecessors that were at one time sites of or sites associated with
manufactured gas plants the purpose of this investigation is to determine if

         waste materials are present
         such materials constitute an environmental or health risk and
         aps has any responsibility for remedial action

                                       16

position results of operations or liquidity

     arizona department of environmental quality

     adeq issued to aps novs dated september 25 2001 and october 15 2001
alleging among other things the burning of unauthorized materials and storage
of hazardous waste without a permit at the cholla power plant each nov requires
aps to achieve and document compliance with specific environmental requirements
aps has submitted responses to the novs as well as additional information
requested by the agency by letter dated february 28 2003 the arizona attorney
general notified aps that the adeq expects to take enforcement action against
aps regarding the violations included in the novs as well as related
violations aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect

     navajo nation environmental issues

     four corners and the navajo generating station are located on the navajo
reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as
well as leases from the navajo nation aps is the four corners operating agent
aps owns a 100 interest in four corners units 1 2 and 3 and a 15 interest in
four corners units 4 and 5 aps owns a 14 interest in navajo generating station
units 1 2 and 3

     in july 1995 the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution
prevention and control act the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the
navajo nation pesticide act collectively the navajo acts the navajo acts
purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to
promulgate regulations covering air quality drinking water and pesticide
activities including those that occur at four corners and the navajo generating
station the four corners and navajo generating station participants dispute
that purported authority and by separate letters dated october 12 and october
13 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo generating station
participants requested the united states secretary of the interior to resolve
their dispute with the navajo nation regarding whether or not the navajo acts
apply to operations of four corners and the navajo generating station on
october 17 1995 the four corners participants and the navajo generating
station participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo
nation window rock district seeking among other things a declaratory
judgment that

         their respective leases and federal easements preclude the application
          of the navajo acts to the operations of four corners and the navajo
          generating station and

         the navajo nation and its agencies and courts lack adjudicatory
          jurisdiction to determine the enforceability of the navajo acts as
          applied to four corners and the navajo generating station

on october 18 1995 the navajo nation and the four corners and navajo
generating station participants agreed to indefinitely stay these proceedings so

                                       17
page
that the parties may attempt to resolve the dispute without litigation the
secretary and the court have stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by
the parties aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter

     in february 1998 the epa issued regulations identifying those clean air
act provisions for which it is appropriate to treat indian tribes in the same
manner as states the epa has announced that it has not yet determined whether
the clean air act would supersede preexisting binding agreements between the
navajo nation and the four corners participants and the navajo generating
station participants that could limit the navajo nations environmental
regulatory authority over the navajo generating station and four corners aps
believes that the clean air act does not supersede these preexisting
agreements aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter

     in april 2000 the navajo tribal council approved operating permit
regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act we
believe that the regulations fail to recognize that the navajo nation did not
intend to assert jurisdiction over four corners and the navajo generating
station on july 12 2000 the four corners participants and the navajo
generating station participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme
court for review of the operating permit regulations we cannot currently
predict the outcome of this matter

water supply

     assured supplies of water are important for our generating plants at the
present time aps has adequate water to meet its needs however conflicting
claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have
resulted in numerous court actions

     both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps operations
have been the subject of inquiries claims and legal proceedings which will
require a number of years to resolve aps is one of a number of parties in a
proceeding before a state court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream
system from which water for four corners is derived state of new mexico in
the relation of se reynolds state engineer vs united states of america city
of farmington utah international inc et al san juan county new mexico
district court no 75184 an agreement reached with the navajo nation in 1985
however provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the
adjudication the navajo nation will provide for a thenagreed upon cost
sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss

     a summons served on aps in early 1986 required all water claimants in the
lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before
january 20 1987 in an action pending in maricopa county arizona superior
court in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila
river system and source supreme court nos wc790001 through wc 790004
consolidated wc1 wc2 wc3 and wc4 consolidated maricopa county nos
w1 w2 w3 and w4 consolidated palo verde is located within the
geographic area subject to the summons aps rights and the rights of the palo
verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are
potentially at issue in this action as project manager of palo verde aps filed
claims that dispute the courts jurisdiction over the palo verde participants
groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo
verde alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights three of aps other
power plants and two of pinnacle west energys power plants are also located
within the geographic area subject to the summons aps claims dispute the
courts jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants
alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights in november 1999 the
arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater
rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes in

                                       18
page
addition in september 2000 the arizona supreme court issued a decision
affirming the lower courts criteria for resolving groundwater claims
litigation on both of these issues will continue in the trial court no trial
date concerning aps water rights claims has been set in this matter

     aps has also filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed
in arizona in an action pending in the apache county arizona superior court
in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little
colorado river system and source supreme court no wc790006 wc6 apache
county no 6417 aps groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the
geographic area subject to the adjudication and is therefore potentially at
issue in the case aps claims dispute the courts jurisdiction over its
groundwater rights alternatively aps seeks confirmation of such rights a
number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to
certain claims in this matter other claims have been identified as ready for
litigation in motions filed with the court no trial date concerning aps water
rights claims has been set in this matter

     although the foregoing matters remain subject to further evaluation aps
expects that the described litigation will not have a material adverse impact on
its financial position results of operations or liquidity

     the four corners region in which four corners is located has been
experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants
in 2003 as well as later years if adequate moisture is not received in the
watershed that supplies the area various stakeholders in the san juan basin
including the new mexico state engineer are evaluating how water rights might
be affected by the drought conditions including water rights pursuant to the
new mexico state permit that provide approximately 30000 acre feet of water to
four corners we are assessing alternatives for temporary supplies of water and
are working with area stakeholders to minimize the effect if any on operations
of the plant the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time
and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome if any of the drought or whether
the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available or the price
thereof from four corners

reserve margin

     aps 2002 peak onehour demand on its electric system was recorded on july
9 2002 at 5802900 kw compared to the 2001 peak of 5687200 kw recorded on
july 2 2001 taking into account additional capacity then available to aps
under longterm purchase power contracts as well as aps and pinnacle west
energys generating capacity aps capability of meeting system demand on july
9 2002 amounted to 6046600 kw for an installed reserve margin of 65 the
power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time
due in part to planned outages and technical problems the available capacity
from sources actually operable at the time of the 2002 peak amounted to
3877600 kw for a margin of negative 381 firm purchases totaling 2612000
kw including shortterm seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases were
in place at the time of the peak ensuring the ability to meet the load

license from the nrc the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit 1 in
june 1985 unit 2 in april 1986 and unit 3 in november 1987 the full power
operating licenses each valid for a period of approximately 40 years authorize

     nuclear decommissioning costs

     the nrc rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning
of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive
financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated total
decommissioning costs through cost of service rates or through a nonbypassable
charge the nonbypassable systems benefits charge is the charge that the acc
has approved to recover certain types of accapproved costs including costs for
low income programs demand side management consumer education environmental

energy from an energy service provider other than aps the customer will still
have to pay this charge as part of the customers aps electric bill other
mechanisms are prescribed including prepayment if the requirements for

                              results of operations

general

     throughout the following explanations of our results of operations we
refer to gross margin with respect to our regulated electricity segment and
marketing and trading segment gross margin refers to electric operating
revenues less purchased power and fuel costs our real estate segment gross
margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of
suncor other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other
operating expenses which includes el dorados investment in nac which we began
consolidating in our financial statements in july 2002 see note 22 other
gross margin also includes amounts related to aps energy services energy
consulting services

2002 compared with 2001

     our consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2002 was 149
million compared with 312 million for the prior year we recognized a 66
million aftertax charge in 2002 for the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting for trading activities for the early adoption of eitf 023 on october
1 2002 see note 18 in 2001 we recognized a 15 million aftertax charge for
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives as required by
sfas no 133 see note 18

     our income before accounting change for the year ended december 31 2002
was 215 million compared with 327 million for the prior year the
periodtoperiod comparison was lower due to

                                       38
page
         lower earnings contributions from our marketing and trading
          activities reflecting lower liquidity and lower price volatility in
          the wholesale power markets in the western united states

         pretax losses of 59 million related to our investment in nac

         a 49 million pretax writeoff related to the cancellation of redhawk
          units 3 and 4 of which 47 million was recorded in operations and
          maintenance expense and 2 million was recorded in capitalized
          interest and

         severance costs of approximately 36 million pretax recorded in the
          second half of 2002 relating to a voluntary workforce reduction

     the above decreases were partially offset by

         increased earnings contributions from our regulated electricity
          activities reflecting lower replacement power costs for power plant
          outages retail customer growth and higher average usage per customer
          partially offset by the effects of milder weather retail electricity
          price decreases and higher costs for purchased power and gas due to
          higher hedged gas and power prices and

         increased earnings contributions from real estate operations
          primarily as a result of increased sales activities

          increase

     other income statement items

     the increase in real estate segment gross margin of 16 million was
primarily due to increased sales activities

     the decrease in other gross margin of 44 million was primarily due to
losses on el dorados investment in nac see further discussion in note 22
these losses for 2002 totaled approximately 59 million on a pretax basis and
were primarily related to nac contracts with two customers 51 million was
recorded in other gross margin and 8 million was recorded in other expense we
believe we have reserved our exposure with respect to these contracts in all
material respects and as a result we consider these charges to be
nonrecurring

     the increase in operations and maintenance expense of 54 million was due
to a 47 million writeoff related to the cancellation of redhawk units 3 and 4
severance costs of 36 million related to a 2002 voluntary workforce reduction
and other costs of 9 million partially offset by lower costs related to
generation reliability plant outages and maintenance costs of 38 million

     the increase in taxes other than income taxes of 7 million is primarily
due to increased property taxes on higher property balances

     other income decreased 11 million primarily due to an insurance recovery
recorded in 2001 related to environmental remediation costs and other costs see
note 19

     other expense was comparable with the prior year primarily due to losses
recorded related to el dorados investment in nac of approximately 8 million
see further discussion in note 22 offset by 8 million of lower miscellaneous
nonoperating costs see note 19

     net interest expense increased 16 million primarily because of higher debt
balances related to our generation construction program and lower capitalized
interest on our generation construction program due to completion of redhawk
units 1 and 2 in mid2002

2001 compared with 2000

     our consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2001 was 312
million compared with 302 million for the prior year in 2001 we recognized a
15 million aftertax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
for derivatives as required by sfas no 133 see note 18

     our income before accounting change for the year ended december 31 2001
was 327 million compared with 302 million for the prior year the
periodtoperiod comparison benefited from

         strong marketing and trading results including significant benefits
          recognized in the third quarter of 2001 from structured trading
          activities and

         retail customer growth

     the above increases were partially offset by

         lower earnings contributions from our regulated electricity
          activities reflecting higher purchased power and fuel costs due in
          part to increased power plant maintenance generation reliability
          measures and continuing retail electricity price decreases and

         2001 charges related to enron and its affiliates

     replacement of the steam generators in palo verde unit 2 is presently
scheduled for completion during the fall outage of 2003 the palo verde owners
have approved the manufacture of two additional sets of steam generators we
expect that these generators will be installed in units 1 and 3 in the 2005 to
2008 time frame our portion of steam generator expenditures for units 1 2 and
3 is approximately 145 million which will be spent from 2003 through 2008 in
2003 through 2005 94 million of the costs are included in the generation
capital expenditures table above and would be funded with internallygenerated
cash or external financings

     offbalance sheet arrangements

     in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46 consolidation of variable
interest entities fin no 46 requires that we consolidate a vie if we have a
majority of the risk of loss from the vies activities or we are entitled to
receive a majority of the vies residual returns or both a vie is a
corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure that either does
not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities
fin no 46 is effective immediately for any vie created after january 31 2003
and is effective july 1 2003 for vies created before february 1 2003

     in 1986 aps entered into agreements with three separate spe lessors in
order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit 2 the leases are
accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap see note 9 for
further information about the saleleaseback transactions based on our
preliminary assessment of fin no 46 we do not believe we will be required to
consolidate the palo verde spes however we continue to evaluate the
requirements of the new guidance to determine what impact if any it will have
on our financial statements

     aps is also exposed to losses under the palo verde saleleaseback
agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to
be reasonably likely to occur under certain circumstances for example the nrc
issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence
of specified nuclear events aps would be required to assume the debt
associated with the transactions make specified payments to the equity
participants and take title to the leased unit 2 interests which if
appropriate may be required to be written down in value if such an event had
occurred as of december 31 2002 aps would have been required to assume
approximately 285 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately
200 million

     guarantees

     we and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees in support of our
unregulated businesses we have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of aps

     debt provisions

     pinnacle wests and aps significant debt covenants related to their
respective financing arrangements include a debttototalcapitalization ratio
and an interest coverage test pinnacle west and aps are in compliance with such
covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet all the significant
covenant requirement levels the ratio of debt to total capitalization cannot
exceed 65 for both the company and aps at december 31 2002 the ratios are
approximately 54 and 48 for the parent company and aps respectively the
provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two
times the interest requirements for both the company and aps the coverages are
approximately 4 times for the parent company 5 times for the aps bank
agreements and 15 times for the aps mortgage indenture failure to comply with

                                       49
page
such covenant levels would result in an event of default which generally
speaking would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the
covenants

     neither pinnacle wests nor aps financing agreements contain ratings
triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and
principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade however in the event of
a ratings downgrade pinnacle west andor aps may be subject to increased
interest costs under certain financing agreements

     all of pinnacle wests bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions
that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under
these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under other
agreements all of aps bank agreements contain crossdefault provisions that
would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these
bank agreements if aps were to default under other agreements pinnacle wests
and aps credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders
could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in our
financial condition or financial prospects

     pinnacle west parent company

     our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders equity
infusions into our subsidiaries primarily pinnacle west energy and interest
payments and optional and mandatory repayments of principal on our longterm
debt see the table above for our contractual requirements including our debt
repayment obligations but excluding optional repayments on october 23 2002
our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated
annual rate of 170 per share from 160 per share effective with the december
1 2002 dividend payment the level of our common dividends and future dividend
growth will be dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to
payout ratio trends free cash flow and financial market conditions

     our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps external financings and
cash distributions from our other subsidiaries primarily suncor for the years
2000 through 2002 total dividends from aps were 510 million and total
distributions from suncor were 33 million for the year ended december 31
2002 dividends from aps were approximately 170 million and distributions from
suncor were approximately 13 million we expect suncor to make cash
distributions to the parent company of 80 million to 100 million annually in
2003 through 2005 due to anticipated accelerated asset sales activity

     on december 23 2002 we issued 6555000 shares of common stock no par
value which resulted in net proceeds of 199 million see note 7

     we have financed pinnacle west energys generation construction program
premised upon pinnacle west energys receipt of aps generation assets by the

outlook  regulatory matters and acc applications in note 3 for additional
information

     in 2002 the parent company issued 215 million in longterm debt and had
no repayments of longterm debt see note 6

     the parent companys outstanding long and shortterm debt was approximately
887 million at december 31 2002 at december 31 2002 our commitments totaled
475 million which were available to support the issuance of commercial paper
or to be used as bank borrowings at december 31 2002 we had about 24 million
of commercial paper outstanding and 72 million of shortterm borrowings our
longterm debt including current maturities totaled 791 million at december 31
2002

     in mid2003 we will need to refinance approximately 475 million of parent
company indebtedness including a total of 225 million we expect to borrow
under an existing credit facility we expect that this indebtedness will be
repaid through funds borrowed by pinnacle west energy from aps under the 500
million financing arrangement recently approved by the acc

     as part of a multiemployer pension plan sponsored by pinnacle west we
contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations but no
more than the maximum taxdeductible amount the minimum required funding takes
into consideration the value of the fund assets and our pension obligation we
elected to contribute cash to our pension plan in each of the last five years
our minimum required contributions during each of those years was zero
specifically we contributed 27 million for 2002 24 million for 2001 44
million for 2000 25 million for 1999 and 14 million for 1998 aps and other
subsidiaries fund their share of the pension contribution of which aps
represents approximately 90 of the total funding amounts described above the
assets in the plan are mostly domestic common stocks bonds and real estate we
currently forecast a pension contribution in 2003 of approximately 50 million
all or part of which may be required if the fund performance continues to
decline as a result of a continued decline in equity markets larger
contributions may be required in future years

     as a result of a change in irs guidance we claimed a tax deduction related
to an aps tax accounting method change on the 2001 federal consolidated income
tax return the accelerated deduction has resulted in a 200 million reduction
in the current income tax liability in 2002 we received an income tax refund
of approximately 115 million related to our 2001 federal consolidated income
tax return

extent necessary external financings aps has historically paid for its
dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations

     in 2002 aps issued 375 million in longterm debt refinanced 90 million
in longterm debt and redeemed approximately 247 million in longterm debt see

about 250 million which were available either to support the issuance of
commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings at december 31 2002 aps had
no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings

     although provisions in aps first mortgage bond indenture articles of
incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of additional
first mortgage bonds debt and preferred stock that aps may issue aps does not
expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital
requirements

                          critical accounting policies

     in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap management
must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of
the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those
judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from
those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most
critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the
underlying accounting standards and operations involved

         regulatory accounting  regulatory accounting allows for the actions
          of regulators such as the acc and the ferc to be reflected in the
          financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs
          that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period
          by unregulated companies

         pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting  changes in our
          actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other
          postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant
          impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant
          actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our
          liability and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets
          used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the longterm

         derivative accounting  derivative accounting requires evaluation of
          rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations our
          evaluation of these rules as they apply to our contracts will
          determine whether we use accrual accounting or fair value
          marktomarket accounting marktomarket accounting requires that
          changes in fair value be recorded in earnings or if certain hedge
          accounting criteria are met in other comprehensive income

                                       53
page
         marktomarket accounting  the market value of our derivative
          contracts is not always readily determinable in some cases we use
          models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value the use
          of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective
          and complex judgment actual results could differ from the results
          estimated through application of these methods our marketing and
          trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a
          portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the
          sales transactions

     see the discussion below for further details on our critical accounting
policies

regulatory accounting

     for our regulated operations we prepare our financial statements in
accordance with sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of
regulation sfas no 71 requires a costbased rateregulated enterprise to
reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements as a
result we capitalize certain costs that would be included as expense in the
current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred
costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in
customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make
refunds to customers for previous collections of costs not likely to be
incurred

     we are required to discontinue applying sfas no 71 when deregulatory
legislation is passed or a rate order is issued that contains sufficient detail
to determine its effect on the portion of the business being deregulated in
1999 we discontinued the application of sfas no 71 for aps generation
operations due to the 1999 settlement agreement with the acc see note 3 for a
discussion of the 1999 settlement agreement

     in 2002 the acc directed aps not to transfer its generation assets as
previously required by the 1999 settlement agreement see track a order in
note 3 accordingly we now consider aps generation to be costbased
rateregulated and subject to the requirements of sfas no 71 the impact of
this change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements

     management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable
of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory
environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the
same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and
regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future if
future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off
as a charge to current period earnings we had 241 million of regulatory assets
included on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2002 see notes 1
and 3 for more information

pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting

     we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a nonqualified
supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for our employees and employees of
our subsidiaries our reported costs of providing defined pension and other
postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from
actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension and other
postretirement benefit costs for example are impacted by actual employee
demographics including age compensation levels and employment periods the
level of contributions we make to the plans and earnings on plan assets changes
made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension
and other postretirement benefit costs pension and other postretirement benefit

                                       54
page
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial
assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and
the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and
pension and other postretirement benefit costs

     pinnacle wests pension and other postretirement plan assets are primarily
made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity
market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in
increased or decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs in future
periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and
the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets could also increase or
decrease recorded pension and other postretirement benefit costs

     we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas
no 87 employers accounting for pensions which requires amounts recognized
in our financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis changes in
pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately
recognized as pension costs on the income statement but generally are
recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan
participants as such significant portions of pension costs recorded in any
period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan
participants

     the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a one
percent increase or decrease in certain actuarial assumptions related to our
defined benefit pension plans each sensitivity below reflects the impact of
changing only that assumption the chart shows the increase decrease each
change in assumption would have on the 2002 projected benefit obligation our
2002 reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our 2002
reported annual pension expense after consideration of amounts capitalized or
billed to electric plant participants on the consolidated statements of income

     in 2002 we assumed that the expected longterm rate of return on plan
assets would be 10 however the plan assets have earned a rate of return
substantially less than 10 in the last three years due to sharp declines in the
equity markets for 2003 we decreased our expected longterm rate of return on
plan assets to 9 as a result of continued declines in general equity and bond
market returns

derivative accounting

     we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and
transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions allowances
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various
commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and options and
overthecounter forwards options and swaps as part of our risk management
program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of
electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in market
value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged
commodities in addition subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the
ermc we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from
market price movements

     we examine contracts at inception to determine the appropriate accounting
treatment if a contract does not meet the derivative criteria or if it
qualifies for a sfas no 133 scope exception we account for the contract on an
accrual basis with associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the
contracted commodities are delivered or received sfas no 133 provides a scope
exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and sales criteria
specified in the standard most of our nontrading electricity purchase and
sales agreements qualify as normal purchases and sales and are exempted from
recognition in the financial statements until the electricity is delivered

     for contracts that qualify as a derivative and do not meet a sfas no 133
scope exception we further examine the contract to determine if it will qualify
for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the effective portion of
derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are
recognized as either an asset or liability and in common stock equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains and losses
related to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of expected transactions
are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel expense as an offset to
the related item being hedged when the underlying hedged physical transaction
impacts earnings if a contract does not meet the hedging criteria in sfas no
133 we recognize the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in
income each period through marktomarket accounting

     on october 1 2002 we adopted eitf 023 which rescinded eitf 9810 as a
result our energy trading contracts that are derivatives continue to be
accounted for at fair value under sfas no 133 contracts that were previously
markedtomarket as trading activities under eitf 9810 that do not meet the
accounting definition of a derivative are now accounted for on an accrual basis
with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted
commodities are delivered or received additionally all gains and losses
realized and unrealized on energy trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the
consolidated statements of income on a net basis the rescission of eitf 9810
has no effect on the accounting for derivative instruments used for nontrading
activities which continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133

marktomarket accounting

     under marktomarket accounting the purchase or sale of energy commodities
is reflected at fair market value net of valuation adjustments with resulting
unrealized gains and losses recorded as assets and liabilities from risk
management and trading activities in the consolidated balance sheets

     we determine fair market value using activelyquoted prices when available
we consider quotes for exchangetraded contracts and overthecounter quotes
obtained from independent brokers to be activelyquoted

     when activelyquoted prices are not available we use prices provided by
other external sources this includes quarterly and calendar year quotes from
independent brokers we shape quarterly and calendar year quotes into monthly
prices based on historical relationships

     for options longterm contracts and other contracts for which price quotes
are not available we use models and other valuation methods the valuation
models we employ utilize spot prices forward prices historical market data and
other factors to forecast future prices the primary valuation technique we use
to calculate the fair value of contracts where price quotes are not available is
based on the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market
data for more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions
at the more illiquid delivery points we also value option contracts using a
variation of the blackscholes optionpricing model

     for nonexchange traded contracts we calculate fair market value based on
the average of the bid and offer price and we discount to reflect net present
value we maintain certain valuation adjustments for a number of risks
associated with the valuation of future commitments these include valuation
adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of
counterparties the liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that
would be incurred if all unmatched positions were closedout or hedged

     a credit valuation adjustment is also recorded to represent estimated
credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties taking into account
netting arrangements expected default experience for the credit rating of the
counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio counterparties
in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies municipalities
and local distribution companies we maintain credit policies that management
believes minimize overall credit risk determination of the credit quality of
counterparties is based upon a number of factors including credit ratings
financial condition project economics and collateral requirements when
applicable we employ standardized agreements that allow for the netting of
positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty see
factors affecting our financial outlook  market risks  commodity price risk
below and note 18 for further discussion on credit risk

     the use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market
value often requires subjective and complex judgment actual results could
differ from the results estimated through application of these methods our
marketing and trading portfolio includes structured activities hedged with a
portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales

accounting for derivative and trading activities

     during 2002 the eitf discussed eitf 023 and reached a consensus on
certain issues eitf 023 rescinded eitf 9810 and was effective october 25
2002 for any new contracts and on january 1 2003 for existing contracts with
early adoption permitted we adopted the eitf 023 guidance for all contracts in
the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a 66 million aftertax charge in net
income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated
unrealized marktomarket on energy trading contracts that did not meet the
accounting definition of a derivative as a result our energy trading contracts
that are derivatives continue to be accounted for at fair value under sfas no
133 contracts that were previously markedtomarket as trading activities under
eitf 9810 that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for
on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time
the contracted commodities are delivered or received additionally all gains
and losses realized and unrealized on energy trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the
consolidated statements of income on a net basis the rescission of eitf 9810
has no effect on the accounting for derivative instruments used for nontrading
activities which continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133

     eitf 023 requires that derivatives held for trading purposes whether
settled financially or physically be reported in the income statement on a net
basis previous guidance under eitf 9810 permitted physically settled energy
trading contracts to be reported either gross or net in the income statement
beginning in the third quarter of 2002 we netted all of our energy trading
activities on the consolidated statements of income and restated prior year
amounts for all periods presented reclassification of such trading activity to
a net basis of reporting resulted in reductions in both revenues and purchased
power and fuel costs but did not have any impact on our financial condition
results of operations or cash flows

     in 2001 we adopted sfas no 133 and recorded a 15 million aftertax
charge in net income and a 72 million aftertax credit in common stock equity
as a component of other comprehensive income both as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 18 for further information
on accounting for derivatives under sfas no 133

asset retirement obligations

     on january 1 2003 we adopted sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations the standard requires the fair value of asset
retirement obligations to be recorded as a liability along with an offsetting
plant asset when the obligation is incurred accretion of the liability due to
the passage of time will be an operating expense and the capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the longlived asset see note 1 for more
information regarding our previous accounting for removal costs

                                       59
page
     we determined that we have asset retirement obligations for our nuclear
facilities nuclear decommissioning and certain other generation transmission
and distribution assets on january 1 2003 we recorded a liability of 219
million for our asset retirement obligations including the accretion impacts a
67 million increase in the carrying amount of the associated assets and a net
reduction of 192 million in accumulated depreciation related primarily to the
reversal of previously recorded accumulated decommissioning and other removal
costs related to these obligations additionally we recorded a regulatory
liability of 40 million for our asset retirement obligations related to our
regulated utility this regulatory liability represents the difference between
the amount currently being recovered in regulated rates and the amount
calculated under sfas no 143 we believe we can recover in regulated rates the
transition costs and ongoing current period costs calculated in accordance with
sfas no 143

stockbased compensation

     in the third quarter of 2002 we began applying the fair value method of
accounting for stockbased compensation as provided for in sfas no 123
accounting for stockbased compensation we recorded approximately 500000 in
stock option expense before income taxes in our consolidated statements of
income for 2002 see notes 1 and 16 for further information on the impacts of
adopting the fair value method provided in sfas no 123

     general

     on september 21 1999 the acc approved rules that provide a framework for
the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona on september 23
1999 the acc approved a comprehensive settlement agreement among aps and
various parties related to the implementation of retail electric competition in
arizona under the rules as modified by the 1999 settlement agreement aps was
required to transfer all of its competitive electric assets and services to an
unaffiliated party or parties or to a separate corporate affiliate or affiliates
no later than december 31 2002 consistent with that requirement aps had been
addressing the legal and regulatory requirements necessary to complete the
transfer of its generation assets to pinnacle west energy on or before that
date on september 10 2002 the acc issued the track a order which among
other things directed aps not to transfer its generation assets to pinnacle
west energy

     1999 settlement agreement

     the 1999 settlement agreement has affected and will affect our results of
operations as part of the 1999 settlement agreement aps agreed to reduce
retail electricity prices for standardoffer fullservice customers with loads
less than three megawatts in a series of annual decreases of 15 on july 1
1999 through july 1 2003 for a total of 75 for customers with loads three
megawatts or greater standardoffer rates were reduced in annual increments
totaling 5 in the years 1999 through 2002

     the 1999 settlement agreement also removed as a regulatory disallowance
234 million before income taxes 183 million net present value from ongoing
regulatory cash flows aps recorded this regulatory disallowance as a net
reduction of regulatory assets and reported it as a 140 million aftertax
extraordinary charge on the 1999 consolidated statement of income as discussed
under aps general rate case below aps intends to seek recovery of this 234
million writeoff in its next general rate case

     prior to the 1999 settlement agreement the acc accelerated the
amortization of substantially all of aps regulatory assets to an eightyear
period that would have ended june 30 2004 the regulatory assets to be
recovered under the 1999 settlement agreement are currently being amortized as

     aps financing application

     on september 16 2002 aps filed an application with the acc requesting the
acc to allow aps to borrow up to 500 million and to lend the proceeds to
pinnacle west energy or to the company to guarantee up to 500 million of
pinnacle west energys or the companys debt or a combination of both not to
exceed 500 million in the aggregate in its application aps stated that the
accs reversal of the generation asset transfer requirement and the resulting
bifurcation of generation assets between aps and pinnacle west energy under
different regulatory regimes result in pinnacle west energy being unable to
attain investmentgrade credit ratings this in turn precludes pinnacle west
energy from accessing capital markets to refinance the bridge financing that we
provided to fund the construction of pinnacle west energy generation assets or
from effectively competing in the wholesale markets on march 27 2003 the acc
authorized aps to lend up to 500 million to pinnacle west energy guarantee up
to 500 million of pinnacle west energy debt or a combination of both not to
exceed 500 million in the aggregate see acc applications in note 3 for

     competitive procurement process

     on september 10 2002 the acc issued an order that among other things
established a requirement that aps competitively procure certain power
requirements on march 14 2003 the acc issued the track b order which
documented the decision made by the acc at its open meeting on february 27 2003
addressing this requirement under the accs track b order aps will be required
to solicit bids for certain estimated capacity and energy requirements for
periods beginning july 1 2003 for 2003 aps will be required to solicit
competitive bids for about 2500 mw of capacity and about 4600 gigawatthours
of energy or approximately 20 of aps total retail energy requirements the
bid amounts are expected to increase in 2004 and 2005 based largely on growth in
aps retail load and aps retail energy sales the track b order also confirmed
that it was not intended to change the current rate base status of aps
existing assets the order recognizes aps right to reject any bids that are
unreasonable uneconomical or unreliable

     aps expects to issue requests for proposals in march 2003 and to complete
the selection process by june 1 2003 pinnacle west energy will be eligible to
bid to supply aps electricity requirements see track b order in note 3 for
additional information

     aps general rate case

     as required by the 1999 settlement agreement on or before june 30 2003
aps will file a general rate case with the acc in this rate case aps will
update its cost of service and rate design in addition aps expects to seek

         rate base treatment of certain power plants currently owned by
          pinnacle west energy specifically redhawk units 1 and 2 west
          phoenix units 4 and 5 and saguaro unit 3

         recovery of costs incurred by aps in preparation for the previously
          required transfer of generation assets to pinnacle west energy

we assume that the acc will make a decision in this general rate case by the end
of 2004

     wholesale power market conditions

     the marketing and trading division which we moved to aps in early 2003 for
future marketing and trading activities existing wholesale contracts will
remain at pinnacle west as a result of the accs track a order prohibiting aps
transfer of generating assets to pinnacle west energy focuses primarily on
managing aps purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of
serving retail customer demand additionally the marketing and trading
division subject to specified parameters markets hedges and trades in
electricity fuels and emission allowances and credits earnings contributions
from our marketing and trading division were lower in 2002 compared to 2001 due
to weak wholesale power market conditions in the western united states which

                                       62
page
included a lack of market liquidity fewer creditworthy counterparties lower
wholesale market prices and resulting decreases in sales volumes our 2003
earnings will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power
market

     generation construction

     see capital needs and resources  pinnacle west energy above and note 11
for information regarding pinnacle west energys generation construction
program the planned additional generation is expected to increase revenues
fuel expenses operating expenses and financing costs

     factors affecting operating revenues

     general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity
in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale
bulk power markets in the western united states these revenues are expected to
be affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix customer
growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity prices and
variations in weather from period to period competitive sales of energy and
energyrelated products and services are made by aps energy services in western
states that have opened to competitive supply

     customer growth customer growth in aps service territory averaged about
36 a year for the three years 2000 through 2002 we currently expect customer
growth to average about 35 per year from 2003 to 2005 we currently estimate
that retail electricity sales in kilowatthours will grow 35 to 55 a year in
2003 through 2005 before the retail effects of weather variations the customer
growth and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to energy delivery
customers as previously noted under the 1999 settlement agreement we agreed
to retail electricity price reductions of 15 annually through july 1 2003
see note 3

     other factors affecting future financial results

     purchased power and fuel costs purchased power and fuel costs are impacted
by our electricity sales volumes existing contracts for purchased power and
generation fuel our power plant performance prevailing market prices new
generating plants being placed in service and our hedging program for managing
such costs

     operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are
expected to be affected by sales mix and volumes power plant additions and
operations inflation outages higher trending pension and other postretirement
benefit costs and other factors in july 2002 we implemented a voluntary
workforce reduction as part of our cost reduction program we recorded 36
million before taxes in voluntary severance costs in the second half of 2002 in
addition we are expecting to produce annual operating expense savings of
approximately 30 million beginning in 2003 as a result of this workforce
reduction

     depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization
expenses are expected to be affected by net additions to existing utility plant
and other property changes in regulatory asset amortization and our generation
construction program west phoenix unit 4 was placed in service in june 2001
redhawk units 1 and 2 and the new saguaro unit 3 began commercial operations in

     property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property
taxes which are affected by tax rates and the value of property inservice and
under construction the average property tax rate for aps which currently owns
the majority of our property was 97 of assessed value for 2002 and 93 for
2001 we expect property taxes to increase primarily due to our generation
construction program and our additions to existing facilities

     interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt
outstanding and the interest rates on that debt the primary factors affecting
borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital
requirements and our internallygenerated cash flow capitalized interest
offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under
construction we stop recording capitalized interest on a project when it is
placed in commercial operation as noted above we have placed new power plants
in commercial operation in 2001 and 2002 and we expect to bring additional
plants online in 2003 and 2004 we are continuing to evaluate our generation
construction program interest expense is affected by interest rates on
variablerate debt and interest rates on the refinancing of the companys future
liquidity needs

     retail competition the regulatory developments and legal challenges to the
rules discussed in note 3 have raised considerable uncertainty about the status
and pace of retail electric competition in arizona although some very limited
retail competition existed in aps service area in 1999 and 2000 there are
currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other
utility services to aps customers as a result we cannot predict when and the
extent to which additional competitors will reenter aps service territory

     subsidiaries in the case of suncor we are undertaking an aggressive effort
to accelerate asset sales activities to approximately double suncors annual
earnings in 2003 to 2005 compared to the 19 million in earnings recorded in
2002 a portion of these sales could be reported as discontinued operations on
the consolidated statements of income

     the annual earnings contribution from aps energy services is expected to be
positive over the next several years due primarily to a number of retail
electricity contracts in california aps energy services had pretax earnings of
28 million in 2002

performance for el dorado el dorados strategies focus on prudently realizing

see forwardlooking statements below for further information on such factors
which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek

     our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest
rates commodity prices and investments held by the nuclear decommissioning
trust fund and our pension plans

     interest rate and equity risk

     our major financial market risk exposure is changing interest rates
changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variablerate debt and
interest earned by our pension plan see note 8 and nuclear decommissioning
trust fund see note 12 our policy is to manage interest rates through the use
of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt the pension plan and
nuclear decommissioning fund also have risks associated with changing market

     commodity price risk

     we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price
and transportation costs of electricity natural gas coal and emissions
allowances we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by
utilizing various commodity derivatives including exchangetraded futures and
options and overthecounter forwards options and swaps the ermc consisting
of senior officers oversees companywide energy risk management activities and
monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance
with our stated energy risk management and trading policies as part of our risk
management program we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and
sales of electricity fuels and emissions allowances and credits the changes in
market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the
hedged commodities in addition subject to specified risk parameters monitored
by the ermc we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit
from market price movements

     prior to october 1 2002 we accounted for our energy trading contracts at
fair value in accordance with eitf 9810 on october 1 2002 we adopted eitf
023 which rescinded eitf 9810 as a result our energy trading contracts that
are derivatives continue to be accounted for at fair value under sfas no 133
contracts that were previously markedtomarket as trading activities under eitf
9810 that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for on
an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the
contracted commodities are delivered or received additionally all gains and
losses realized and unrealized on energy trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the
consolidated statements of income on a net basis the rescission of eitf 9810
has no effect on the accounting for derivative instruments used for nontrading
activities which continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133
see note 18 for details on the change in accounting for energy trading contracts
and further discussion regarding derivative accounting

                                       66

     both nontrading and trading derivatives are classified as assets and
liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the consolidated
balance sheets for nontrading derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting treatment changes in the fair value of the effective portion are
recognized in common stock equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss nontrading derivatives or any portion thereof
that are not effective hedges are adjusted to fair value through income gains
and losses related to nontrading derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges
of expected transactions are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel
expense as an offset to the related item being hedged when the underlying hedged
physical transaction impacts earnings if it becomes probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur we discontinue the use of hedge accounting and
recognize in income the unrealized gains and losses that were previously
recorded in other comprehensive income loss in the event a nontrading
derivative is terminated or settled the unrealized gains and losses remain in
other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in income when the
underlying transaction impacts earnings

     derivatives associated with trading activities are adjusted to fair value
through income derivative commodity contracts for the physical delivery of
purchase and sale quantities transacted in the normal course of business are
exempt from the requirements of sfas no 133 under the normal purchase and sales
exception and are not reflected on the balance sheet at fair value most of our
nontrading electricity purchase and sales agreements qualify as normal
purchases and sales and are exempted from recognition in the financial
statements until the electricity is delivered

     our assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities are
presented in two categories consistent with our business segments

         system  our regulated electricity business segment which consists of
          nontrading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases and sales
          of electricity and fuel for our native load requirements and

         marketing and trading  our nonregulated competitive business
          segment which includes both nontrading and trading derivative
          instruments

     the company no longer reports nonderivative energy contracts or physical
inventories at fair value since july 1 2002 the company has not recognized a
dealer profit or unrealized gain or loss at the inception of a derivative unless
the fair value of that instrument in its entirety is evidenced by quoted
market prices or current market transactions prior to the change in our policy
we recorded net gains at inception of 10 million in 2002 and 3 million in
2001 these amounts included a reasonable marketing margin

     a  these contracts are structured sales activities hedged with a
          portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the
          sales transactions
     b  these contracts are hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas
          and electricity the impact of these hypothetical price movements
          would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements
          would have on the physical exposures being hedged

credit risk

     we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by
counterparties we have risk management and trading contracts with many
counterparties including two counterparties for which a worst case exposure
represents approximately 33 of our 181 million of risk management and trading
assets as of december 31 2002 our risk management process assesses and
monitors the financial exposure of these and all other counterparties despite
the fact that the great majority of trading counterparties are rated as
investment grade by the credit rating agencies including the counterparties
noted above there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies
could default resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a
given period counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major
energy companies municipalities and local distribution companies we maintain
credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within
acceptable limits determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is
based upon a number of factors including credit ratings and our evaluation of
their financial condition in many contracts we employ collateral requirements
and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative
exposures associated with a single counterparty valuation adjustments are
established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties see critical accounting policies  marktomarket accounting
