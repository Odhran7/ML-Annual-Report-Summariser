risks related to covid19 

the company’s revenue results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing covid19 outbreak 

the company continues to closely monitor the global impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the recent resurgence of infections and associated covid19 variants which may have a significant negative effect on revenue results of operations cash flow and liquidity governmental authorities and private enterprises globally are continuing to implement actions to mitigate the covid19 pandemic including restrictions on public gatherings travel and commercial operations temporary closures or decreased operations of dental offices as well as certain government mandates to limit certain dental procedures to those that could be considered emergency only these measures and the impact of covid19 generally may result in or continue to result in 

• supply chain disruptions for products we sell including the inability to obtain raw materials the inflated price of inputs disruptions of the operations of our logistics service providers and the resulting delays in shipments 

• continuing or new partial or countrywide business lockdowns in various markets 

• temporary closures or significantly reduced operations at most of the company’s principal manufacturing and distribution locations including furloughing employees related to these locations which could reduce the company’s ability to manufacture and deliver products to customers 

• global reductions in customer demand for certain of the company’s products and services 

• a shift in service delivery options and customer expectations in regard to service delivery options 

• decreased financial viability of the company’s suppliers which could cause them to change the terms on which they are willing to provide products 

• the inability or failure of customers to timely meet payment obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties which may have a negative material impact on the companys cash flow liquidity and statements of operations 

• fear of exposure to or actual effects of the covid19 pandemic in countries where operations or customers are located and may lead to decreased procedures at dental offices the impacts include but are not limited to significant reductions or volatility in demand and increased pricing pressures for one or more of the companys products 

• a recession or prolonged period of economic slowdown which may significantly reduce the company’s cash flow and negatively impact the cost and access to capital and funding sources for the company 

• the company’s inability to maintain compliance with covenants under the revolving credit facilities or 

• the reduced availability of key employees or members of management due to quarantine or illness as a result of covid19 may temporarily affect the financial performance and results of operations if the company is unable to mitigate these or other similar risks its business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the company does not yet know the full extent of the ultimate impact of the continued covid19 pandemic on its business operations or the global economy given the dynamic nature of the covid19 outbreak it is very difficult to predict the severity of the impact on the company’s business the extent of such impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty including new information which may emerge concerning the spread and severity of outbreak including covid19 variants and actions taken to address the impacts among others there are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of the covid19 to the extent that the covid19 outbreak continues to adversely affect the business and financial performance it also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report 

risks related to our businesses 

the company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies 

as part of the restructuring plan adopted in november 2018 the company announced that it intends to grow revenues expand margins and simplify the business the company continues to generate a substantial portion of its revenue through a limited number of distributors which provide important sales distribution and service support to the enduser customers together the companys two largest distributors patterson and henry schein accounted for approximately 13 of the company’s annual revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and it is anticipated that they will continue to be the largest distribution contributors to the company’s revenue through 2022 the company may be unable to execute its key strategic activities and investments due to the competing priorities of its distribution partners which may introduce competing private label generic or lowcost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points particularly in the technologies  equipment segment products that are sold and serviced through distributor channels if these competing products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

additionally some parts of the dental market continue to be impacted by price competition which are driven in part by the consolidation of dental practices innovation and product advancements and the price sensitivity of enduser customers there can be no assurance that the company’s distribution partners will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from the company or that they will continue to purchase any products at all if patterson or henry schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from the company or if changes in the company’s promotional strategies and investments result in changes in the company’s distributor relationships or shortterm uneven growth it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies in part on its dealer and customer relationships and predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results these inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected these changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the dealers and customers economic conditions and customer preference for particular products there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory buildup or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history additionally the company periodically upgrades or replaces its various software systems including its customer relationship management systems if the company encounters unforeseen problems with new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any cyberattacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

due to the global nature of the company’s business and reliance on information systems to provide the company’s services the company uses webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering the company’s services as the breadth and complexity of company’s information systems continue to grow the company will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

• disruption impairment or failure of data centers telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms 

• security breaches of cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware and 

• excessive costs excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment 

any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” cyberattacks and other attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations the company’s network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruptions and the company may be the victim of cyberattacks targeted at the theft of financial assets intellectual property employee information personal information of individuals and customers or other sensitive information cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated like other large global companies the company has experienced in 2021 and expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time although no such cyberattacks have had a material adverse effect on the company to date the company cannot provide assurance that despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of the company’s systems and the measures that the company or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats a future cyberattack would not result in material harm to the company or its business and results of operations particularly as cyberthreats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against for example certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources these data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of the company’s information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyberattacks could also cause the company to incur significant remediation costs disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data and the daytoday management of the company’s business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data disaster recovery plans where in place might not adequately protect the company in the event of a system failure further the company currently does not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions the company take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the company’s servers 

any of the foregoing incidents could also subject the company to liability expose the company to significant expense or cause significant harm to the company’s reputation all of which could result in lost revenues while the company has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from cyberattacks technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of crossborder data transfer restrictions and other regulations may adversely affect our business 

global regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage and use of personal information such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for the company’s services or restrict the company’s ability to store and process data or in some cases impact our ability to offer future digital dentistry services in certain locations or our ability to deploy our solutions globally the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by these types of laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance any of which could harm our business 

ineffective internal controls and lack of global standardized processes andor centralization of transaction management andor execution could result in control deficiencies and impact management’s assertions and financial reporting 

the company’s implementation of its business plans restructuring plans and compliance with regulations requires that the company effectively manage its financial infrastructure including standardizing processes maintaining proper financial reporting and internal controls the company continues to focus on standardizing its processes improving its financial systems maintaining effective internal controls and centralizing transaction management andor execution so as to provide continued assurance with respect to the companys financial reports support the continued growth of the business and prevent financial misstatement or fraud nonstandardized processes and ineffective controls could result in an inability to aggregate and analyze data in a timely and accurate manner and may lead to inaccurate or incomplete financial and management reporting and delays in financial reporting to management regulators andor shareholders inaccurate or incomplete financial reporting and disclosures could also result in noncompliance with applicable business and regulatory requirements and the incurring of related penalties 

additionally internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or omissions because of certain limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud as a result even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if the company fails to maintain adequate internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if the company experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls the companys business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet the companys reporting obligations 

further the company currently has disparate systems including enterprise resource planning systems across the organization which may result in the potential inability to obtain and analyze business data and increases in budgets due to higher costs stemming from system upgrades and may pose business partner connection challenges as a result the data required to manage the business may not be complete accurate or consistent resulting in the potential for misleading or inaccurate reporting for key business decisions 

the success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions and dispositions and strategic investments 

with respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses and strategic investments the company may not achieve expected returns and benefits as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology in addition the company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities 

further acquisitions dispositions and strategic investments may distract the company’s management’s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships with customers employees suppliers or other parties however the company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the company achieve its strategic objectives and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy 

after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may prevent the company from completing the transaction in a timely manner or at all from a workforce perspective risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include among others delays in anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impacts on the company’s relationship with labor unions adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

when the company decides to sell assets or a business the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives alternatively the company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the company had anticipated or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business such as through continuing equity ownership transition service agreements guarantees indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the acquired or divested business or other conditions outside the company’s control could affect its future financial results 

in the context of acquisitions there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations the company may not achieve the full revenue growth expectations and cost synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition 

additionally if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or stimulate customer demand 

the worldwide markets for dental and medical products is highly competitive and is driven by rapid and significant technological change change in consumer preferences new intellectual property associated with that technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions additionally some markets for products are also subject to significant negative price pressures the company’s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life there can be no assurance that the company’s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the company’s investment in product development if product demand decreases our revenue and profit could be negatively impacted important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in 

• business conditions including downturns in the dental industry regional economies and the overall economy 

• the level of customers inventories 

• competitive and pricing pressures including actions taken by competitors and 

• customer product needs and customerpatient lifecycle 

if the company fails to further develop its innovation efforts or if the company’s research and development does not effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences or market competition leading to technology or product obsolescence the company may lose market share and revenue additionally if the company’s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete the companys business could be negatively affected the company has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the company’s products obsolete 

the company’s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time resulting in material operating costs and financial losses 

the company operates in more than 150 countries and the company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world potential events such as extreme weather natural disasters worker strikes and social and political actions such as trade wars or other events beyond our control could impact the company’s ongoing business operations including potential critical thirdparty vendor disruptions or failure to adhere to contractual obligations affecting our supply chain and manufacturing needs or the loss of critical information technology and telecommunications systems although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner such events could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

additionally a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products certain dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors the company may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the company’s ability to deliver products to customers 

the company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs the company has announced in the past and may announce in the future restructuring plans or other major initiatives from time to time including workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings the failure to efficiently execute such initiatives as part of the company’s business strategy could minimize the expected benefits to the organization resulting in potential impacts to ongoing operations and cost overruns 

additionally the company’s ability to achieve the benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control the company may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred 

due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities and the quarterly phasing of related investments the company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits such as the goals for net sales growth or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits and its operations and business could be disrupted company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions and implementation may require the agreement of third parties such as labor unions or works councils risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impact on the company’s relationship with labor unions or works councils adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its sales growth and other results of operations cash flows or financial condition or competitive position 

the company has recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges most recently in 2020 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges in the future 

the company acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles the company reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment at least annually the valuation models used to determine the fair value of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates 

following the recording of 35 billion in charges for impairment of certain businesses during 2017 2018 and 2020 the company had an aggregate amount of 40 billion in goodwill on its balance sheet as of december 31 2021 in preparing the financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2020 the company identified a triggering event and recorded a 157 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with one reporting unit within the technologies  equipment segment in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to these business and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 39 million for the three months ended march 31 2020 at december 31 2021 the company has 612 million in indefinitelived intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet 

the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used such as discount rates revenue growth rates perpetual revenue growth rates royalty rates and operating margin percentages of the business as well as current market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries in both the us and globally if the assumptions and projections used in the analyses are not realized it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management’s assumptions underlying the company’s discounted cash flow model the company’s current estimates could vary significantly in the future which may result in a goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charge at that time additionally valuations and impairments that are not complete accurate timely or appropriately recorded could result in potential financial misstatements and delays in impairment analysis 

the companys failure to obtain issued patents and consequently to protect the companys proprietary technology could hurt the companys competitive position 

the company’s success will depend in part on the company’s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to the company’s products technologies and processes both in the united states and in other countries risks and uncertainties that the company faces with respect to the company’s patents and patent applications include the following 

• the pending patent applications that the company has filed or to which the company has exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than the company expects to result in issued patents 

• the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection 

• the company may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable 

• the patents licensed or issued to the company may not provide a competitive advantage 

• other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to the company 

• disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by the company and the company’s respective licensors and 

• other companies may design around the technologies patented by the company 

the company’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon the company’s intellectual property rights or if the companys products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

the company’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or misappropriate dentsply sirona’s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses to protect dentsply sirona’s rights to dentsply sirona’s intellectual property dentsply sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with dentsply sirona’s employees strategic partners and others dentsply sirona cannot assure you that any of dentsply sirona’s patents any of the patents of which dentsply sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to dentsply sirona or which we may license in the future will provide dentsply sirona with a competitive advantage or afford dentsply sirona protection against infringement by others or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties including dentsply sirona’s competitors the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of dentsply sirona’s proprietary information dentsply sirona may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights effective patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which dentsply sirona will offer or intend to offer dentsply sirona’s products any failure to adequately protect dentsply sirona’s intellectual property could devalue dentsply sirona’s proprietary content and impair dentsply sirona’s ability to compete effectively further defending dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 

litigation may also be necessary to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or to defend against any claims of infringement of rights owned by third parties that are asserted against dentsply sirona in addition dentsply sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign patent governing authorities to determine the priority of inventions which could result in substantial costs acquisitions by dentsply sirona of products or businesses that are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and the resulting changes to the competitive landscape of the industry could further increase this risk 

if dentsply sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings dentsply sirona may incur substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the attention of dentsply sirona’s technical and management personnel even if dentsply sirona ultimately prevails an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities allow dentsply sirona’s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from dentsply sirona prohibit dentsply sirona from marketing dentsply sirona’s products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all if dentsply sirona cannot obtain such licenses dentsply sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing dentsply sirona’s products 

the enforcement defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights including the united states patent and trademark office’s the european patent office’s and other foreign patent offices’ interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions as a result these proceedings are costly and timeconsuming and their outcome is uncertain litigation may be necessary to 

• assert against others or defend dentsply sirona against claims of patent or trademark infringement 

• enforce patents owned by or licensed to dentsply sirona from another party 

• protect dentsply sirona’s trade secrets or knowhow or 

• determine the enforceability scope and validity of dentsply sirona’s proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others 

changes in the company’s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

the company utilizes the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time the company’s continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including global economic conditions the condition of global credit markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing operating performance and credit ratings macroeconomic conditions such as the covid19 pandemic may result in significant disruption in the credit markets which may adversely affect the company’s ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

any adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market there is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund obligations or that it will be available on 

commercially reasonable terms in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding in addition the terms of future debt agreements could include additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under the company’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

the company has debt securities outstanding of approximately 19 billion the company also has the ability to incur up to 700 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 2018 credit facility as discussed below and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

the company’s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios which the company is required to satisfy under the note purchase agreement dated december 11 2015 the company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 06 to 10 and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times in each case as such terms are defined in the note purchase agreement all of the company’s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios though no assurance can be given that the company will be able to do so the company’s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness 

breach of covenants could have negative consequences including but not limited to the following 

• making it more difficult for the company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness 

• requiring the company to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness which would reduce the funds the company has available for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures research and development and acquisitions and 

• reducing the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and market conditions 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply sirona’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

additionally dentsply sirona’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through crossdefault provisions would entitle dentsply sirona’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any crossdefault provisions are triggered or to the extent that no other parties are willing to extend financing 

the company hedging and cash management transactions may expose the company to loss or limit the company’s potential gains 

as part of dentsply sirona’s risk management program we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts while intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations these transactions may limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains or expose dentsply sirona to loss should dentsply sirona’s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions 

we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation and although dentsply sirona’s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective for accounting purposes as hedges of underlying physical transactions these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by dentsply sirona’s counterparties their failure to perform could result in dentsply sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of dentsply sirona’s exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing dentsply sirona’s exposure to changes in interest rates if such events occur dentsply sirona’s results of operations may be adversely affected 

most of dentsply sirona’s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure dentsply sirona’s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under dentsply sirona’s 2018 credit facility the failure of any bank in which we deposit dentsply sirona’s funds or that is part of dentsply sirona’s 2018 credit facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in dentsply sirona’s business 

certain of the company’s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending 

certain dental specialty products and dental equipment and related products that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in economic conditions decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect the companys business and result in a decline in sales and financial performance 

risks related to our international operations 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply sirona’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations consolidated balance sheets and cash flows of the company with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us although the company currently uses and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company 

due to the international nature of the companys business including increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately twothirds of the company’s sales are located in regions outside the united states in addition we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply sirona’s revenue operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

• economic and political instability 

• import or export licensing requirements 

• additional compliancerelated risks 

• trade restrictions and tariffs 

• product registration requirements 

• longer payment cycles 

• changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs 

• potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• trade policy changes 

specifically changes in or the imposition of tariffs could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to other countries these measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions the occurrence of a trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products our costs our customers and our suppliers which in turn could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffs regulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect our business and financial performance for example as a result of escalating tensions and the subsequent invasion of ukraine by russia the us and other countries have imposed sanctions on russia including its major financial institutions and certain other businesses and individuals russia may respond in kind and the continuation of the conflict may result in additional sanctions being enacted by the us other north atlantic treaty organization member states or other countries the impact of these sanctions along with the spillover effect of ongoing civil political and economic disturbances on surrounding areas may significantly devalue currencies utilized by the company or have other adverse impacts including increased costs of raw materials and inputs or manufacturing or shipping delays export controls implemented as part of sanctions could also restrict the sale of equipment or products containing us developed software and technology into russia 

for the year ended december 31 2021 net sales in russia and ukraine were approximately 3 of the company’s consolidated net sales and assets in these countries were 63 million the impact of these events on economic conditions in the region is currently unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

risks related to our regulatory environments 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures transfer pricing regulations country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

as a company with international operations we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made the actual outcome could differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and such differences may be material if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we take we could have additional tax liability and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and regulations and changes in interpretations of tax laws due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

our corporate structure is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability the tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for transfer pricing which could increase our effective tax rate and such increase may be material in addition certain governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that could significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities the organization for economic cooperation and development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations including in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates it is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate and such increase may be material and impact our financial position 

dentsply sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances 

dentsply sirona must obtain certain approvals by and marketing clearances from governmental authorities including the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell dentsply sirona’s products in those countries these agencies regulate the marketing manufacturing labeling packaging advertising sale and distribution of medical devices the fda enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of xray emitting devices dentsply sirona’s products are currently regulated by such authorities and dentsply sirona’s new products require approval by or marketing clearance from various governmental authorities including the fda various us states also impose manufacturing licensing and distribution regulations 

the fda review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products a 510k application is required in order to market certain classes of new or modified medical devices if specifically required by the fda a premarket approval or pma may be necessary such proceedings which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device are potentially expensive and time consuming they may delay or hinder a product’s timely entry into the marketplace moreover there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance failure to comply with the fda’s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties 

the company is also subject to other federal state and local laws regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and inadequate employee training for critical compliance and regulatory requirements may result in the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules and regulations 

similar to the fda review process the european union eu review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products such proceedings which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product’s entry into the marketplace 

the company’s products that fall into the category of class i as classified by eu medical device directive were mandated to be certified under the new european union medical device regulation “mdr” these regulations as well applied to all medical device manufacturers who market their medical devices in eu and all had to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under mdr in order to continue to sell those products in the european union “eu” although all medical device manufacturers were required to certify their class i products by may 2021 the eu mdr regulations for additional classes of medical devices is mandated to be fully enforceable by may 2024 this also includes completion of certified quality management systems to manufacturers quality management systems dentsply sirona remains focused on ensuring that all its products that are considered to be medical device will be fully certified as required by the eu mdr dates and timelines additionally the united kingdom “uk” has negotiated an exit from the eu brexit and as a result the eu ce marking will be recognized in the uk through june 2023 following june 2023 the uk may impose its own differing regulatory requirements for products being imported from the eu into the uk 

failure to comply with these rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business also these regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company to make changes in operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private regulators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other thirdparty payors for procedures using dentsply sirona’s products may cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

thirdparty payors including government health administration authorities private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and costeffectiveness of medical products and services while dentsply sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other thirdparty payors will have on future sales of our products there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

challenges may be asserted against the company’s products due to real or perceived quality health or environmental issues 

the company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products while the company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality health or environmental impact of the company’s products or certain raw material components of the company’s products dentsply sirona manufactures and sells dental filling materials that may contain bisphenola commonly called bpa bpa is found in many everyday items such as plastic bottles foods detergents and toys and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a byproduct of other ingredients that have degraded or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants the fda currently allows the use of bpa in dental materials medical devices and food packaging nevertheless public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of bpa could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the company’s products that contain mercury or bpa adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products whether or not ultimately based on fact may have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and operating results and legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation andor product limitations or discontinuation 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to dentsply sirona’s operations which could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s business 

dentsply sirona is subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders relating to health care fraud including but not limited to the us federal antikickback statute the united kingdom’s bribery act 2010 c23 brazil’s clean company act 2014 law no 12846 and chinas national health and family planning commission “nhfpc” circulars no 49 and no 50 some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payors and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payors and programs 

the us government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise dentsply sirona’s marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the us physician payment sunshine act and similar foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders such as france’s loi bertrand and rules issued by denmark’s health and medicines authority the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

failure to comply with health care fraud laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on dentsply sirona’s business also these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require dentsply sirona to make changes in dentsply sirona’s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

we cannot predict whether changes in applicable laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders or the interpretation thereof or changes in dentsply sirona’s services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s business 

dentsply sirona’s business is subject to extensive complex and changing domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes directives circulars and orders that failure to comply with which if not complied with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 

dentsply sirona is subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders which are administered by various international federal and state governmental authorities including among others the fda the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury “ofac” the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of commerce “bis” the united states federal trade commission the united states department of justice the environmental protection agency “epa” and other similar domestic and foreign authorities these laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders include but are not limited to the united states food drug and cosmetic act the european council directive 9342eec on medical devices “mdd” 1993 and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” france’s data protection act of 1978 rev 2004 the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” the us federal antikickback statute and similar international antibribery and anticorruption laws the physician payments sunshine act regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals various environmental regulations such as the federal water pollution control act the “clean water act” the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act the “health care reform law” and regulations relating to trade import and export controls and economic sanctions such laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders are complex and are subject to change 

on december 31 2020 the company acquired byte a leading provider in the directtoconsumer doctordirected clear aligner market byte’s business in the us is subject to various state laws rules and policies which govern the practice of dentistry within such state byte contracts with an expansive nationwide network of independent licensed dentists and orthodontists for the provision of clinical services including the oversight and control of each customer’s clinical treatment however there can be no assurance that such business model will not be challenged as the corporate practice of dentistry by state governmental authorities trade associations or others additionally future legislative or regulatory changes within such states may have a negative impact on byte’s business model 

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders for example most of the company’s products are classified as medical devices or pharmaceuticals which are subject to extensive regulations promulgated by the us federal government state governments and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries including the requirement to obtain licenses for the manufacture or distribution of such products failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may continue to be volatile 

dentsply sirona experiences significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors some of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to 

• the impact of covid19 

• the execution of the company’s restructuring plan 

• the complexity of the company’s organization 

• the timing of new product introductions by dentsply sirona and its competitors 

• the timing of industry trade shows 

• changes in customer inventory levels 

• developments in government or third party payor reimbursement policies 

• changes in customer preferences and product mix 

• the company’s ability to supply products to meet customer demand 

• fluctuations in manufacturing costs 

• changes in income tax laws and incentives which could create adverse tax consequences 

• competitors’ sales promotions 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 

• general economic conditions as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts which could cause its stock price to decline quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents and of delaware law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply sirona 

certain provisions of dentsply sirona’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply sirona such provisions include among others a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsply sirona’s bylaws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any “interested stockholder” with beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock 

general risks 

talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the company’s ability to grow the business 

the company’s success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage its human capital through talent acquisition engagement development and retention to achieve the company’s strategic initiatives the company needs to attract manage and retain employees with the right skills competencies and experiences to support the growth of the business and the failure to attract and retain such employees to fill key roles may adversely affect our business performance competitive position and future prospects the company also must retain a pipeline of team members to provide for continuity of succession for senior executive positions in order to attract and retain qualified employees the company must offer competitive compensation and effectively manage employee performance and development our inability to attract and retain talent may negatively impact business continuity new product launches and innovation initiatives further such organizational challenges may make it difficult to maintain the company’s culture resulting in employees not adhering to the desired values of the organization 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company faces the risk of purported securities class actions investigations by governmental agencies product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products the company has insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ insurance and product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any thirdparty intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

additionally dentsply sirona generally warrants each of the company’s products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment or installation plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer the future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material successful product warranty claims brought against dentsply sirona could reduce its profits andor impair its financial condition and damage the company’s reputation 

climate change and related natural disasters could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

the company operates in more than 150 countries and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world any natural or other disaster in such a location or the increased frequency of extreme weather could disrupt the production and distribution of our products in these locations increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change could also impact our thirdparty vendors service providers or other stakeholders including disruptions on supply chains or information technology or other necessary services for our company 

federal state and local governments are beginning to respond to climate change issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new legislation or regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide could adversely affect our operations and financial results

the impacts of covid19 and the company’s response 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility and uncertainty in the overall markets particularly in the year that followed the initial outbreak late in 2019 leading to changes in consumer behavior government restrictions on individuals and businesses and significant disruption to supply chains in several sectors including dental equipment and medical supplies 

the company’s 2020 results were materially impacted by this disruption at the outset of the pandemic including the closure or reduced operations of dental practices during 2021 demand for the company’s products has largely recovered although impacts from the pandemic continue to be experienced as evidenced by the more recent shortages and higher prices of raw materials such as electronic components transportation and shipping services and labor 

the impacts of covid19 on the company’s operations during 2021 were as follows 

• the company has seen customer demand and dental patient traffic normalize in major markets despite the resurgence of cases late in 2021 due to variants of the covid19 virus public and private dental practices largely remain open although many continue to operate at less than prepandemic capacities certain of the companys markets including regions of southeast asia have experienced setbacks in demand in the second half of the year as a result of renewed covid19 infections from recent variants of the virus while most government authorities have lifted many of their restrictions the end dates for all restrictions being lifted are still unknown and it is uncertain when customer demand will fully return to precovid19 levels upon lifting these restrictions or whether future variants of the virus may have an adverse impact on demand in affected markets 

• during 2021 the company has experienced supply chain constraints which has impacted its ability to timely produce and deliver certain products and has also resulted in increases in shipping rates to address these issues the company has taken steps to mitigate the impact of these trends including continued emphasis on cost reduction and supply chain efficiencies the company continues to monitor the impact of global supply chain issues including shipping disruption and inflation of material inputs as well as labor shortages 

• the companys covid19 infection crisis management process implemented in 2020 remains in effect during 2021 during the pandemic the company has utilized this process to manage several incidents of exposure at facilities all potential and actual cases have been reviewed to ensure that the company managed exposed employees appropriately consistently and safely none of these incidents have resulted in a material loss of production or adverse impact to the company’s operating results the company has continued to prioritize employee safety and preventing the possible spread of covid19 by encouraging ongoing workfromhome where possible and maintaining travel restrictions 

as an ongoing consequence of the publics response to the global pandemic including the restrictive measures imposed to contain its spread it is noted that dental practices have adapted to potentially longterm conventions of social distancing and remote working it is expected that the new conditions will continue to increase demand in dental care markets for the efficiencies and benefits that come from digital solutions in response to this trend which began before the pandemic the company has continued to make investments to promote the transformation of dentistry with advancements in digital workflows software upgrades 3d printing and other offerings such as clinical education that are allowing the company to quickly respond to increased demand for digital dentistry as uncertainty surrounding the pandemic continues as part of the strategic response to its longerterm implications including the increase in demand for digital solutions the company intends to continue targeting investments in this area including the related rd and sales and marketing investments that will bring these innovations to customers 

the impact of recent developments in ukraine 

in february 2022 as a result of the invasion of ukraine by russia economic sanctions were imposed by the us the european union and certain other countries on russian financial institutions and businesses while it is difficult to estimate the impact of current or future sanctions on the company’s business and financial position these sanctions could adversely impact the company’s sales cost of procuring raw materials or distribution costs in future periods refer to part i item 1a risk factors  risks related to our international operations  

as of december 31 2021 the net assets of the company’s subsidiaries in russia and ukraine were 63 million and for the year ended december 31 2021 the company’s net sales in russia and ukraine were approximately 3 of its consolidated net sales 

key performance measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business performance are 1 organic sales by segment and geographic region and 2 adjusted operating income and margins of each reportable segment which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting corporate expenses and certain other items to enhance the comparability of results period to period 

the company defines organic sales as the reported net sales adjusted for 1 net sales from acquired and divested businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition or divestiture 2 net sales attributable to discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods and 3 the impact of foreign currency changes which is calculated by translating currentperiod net sales using the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates 

the organic sales measure is not calculated in accordance with us gaap therefore this item represents a nongaap measure this nongaap measure may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap organic sales is an important internal measure for the company and its senior management who receive a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales the performance of the company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics 

the company discloses organic sales to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the company the company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying net sales trends 

business drivers 

the primary drivers of organic sales include macroeconomic factors global dental market demand innovation and new product launches by the company as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources to drive demand creation including clinical education management believes that the company’s ability to execute its strategies should allow it to grow faster than the underlying dental market over time on a shortterm basis sudden changes in the macroeconomic environment such as those caused by the impacts of covid19 supply chain challenges changes in strategy or distributor inventory levels can and have impacted the companys sales 

the company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis the company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency in addition management continues to evaluate the worldwide consolidation of operations and functions to further reduce costs while the company continues consolidation initiatives which can have an adverse impact on reported results in the short term the company expects that the continued benefits from these global efficiency efforts will improve its cost structure 

subject to the pace of the postpandemic recovery the company intends to continue pursuing opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings technologies and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships and acquisitions although the professional dental market has experienced consolidation it remains fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations in net sales and operating income price increases promotional activities as well as changes in inventory levels at distributors contribute to this fluctuation the company typically implements most of its price increases in january or october of a given year across most of its businesses distributor inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase required minimum purchase commitments under agreements with key distributors may increase inventory levels in excess of retail demand changes in dealer inventory levels have impacted the company’s consolidated net sales in the past and may continue to do so in the future in addition the company may from time to time engage in new distributor relationships that could cause fluctuations of consolidated net sales and operating income distributor inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s projections resulting in the company’s forecast of future results being different than expected 

there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory or patterns of build and liquidation timing in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history as of december 31 2021 certain dealers’ inventory of the company’s cadcam products was higher than at the end of the prior year by approximately 50 million these higher levels of dealer inventory are due to lowerthanexpected retail sales in the fourth quarter and may pose headwinds to the company’s net sales for these products in 2022 

the company anticipates that inventory levels may continue to fluctuate as dealers and customers manage the effects of covid19 and supply chain constraints on their businesses any of these fluctuations could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements for more information about the drivers of our business and related risks see part i item 1 business and part i item 1a risk factors 

restructuring programs 

in 2018 the board of directors approved a plan to restructure and simplify the company’s business which was expanded in 2020 for certain portfolio optimization objectives including the exit of the company’s traditional orthodontics business as well as portions of its laboratory business a primary goal of the restructuring has been to drive annualized net sales growth of 4 to 5 and adjusted operating income margins of 22 by the fourth quarter of 2022 the operating expense reductions have come as a result of additional leverage from continued integration and simplification of the business the expanded program is expected to result in total charges of approximately 345 million and annual cost savings of approximately 250 million since 2018 the company has incurred expenditures of approximately 321 million under these programs of which approximately 123 million were noncash charges the company expects most of the remaining charges will be recorded during the first quarter of 2022 the company has not seen and does not expect a significant impact to net sales as a result of these actions the businesses being exited as part of the portfolio optimization have been experiencing declining sales and were dilutive to the company’s operating income margin the company’s traditional orthodontics business which includes brackets bands tubes and wires had net sales of 92 million in 2020 and 132 million in 2019 the portion of the laboratory business the company is exiting manufactures removable dentures and related products and had net sales of 30 million in 2020 and 44 million in 2019 the net income of these businesses is not material to the company’s consolidated results 

impact of foreign currencies 

due to the company’s global footprint movements in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material impact on its reported net sales and pretax income with approximately twothirds of the company’s net sales originating from regions outside the united states the company’s net sales and results from operation are negatively impacted by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar compared to the primary currencies in which the company operates

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions 

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals and evaluations of existing contingencies liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date more information on the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of acquired intangible assets is included in note 1 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also performs impairment assessments more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the excess amount similarly if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized on the intangible 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is dependent on significant assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates revenue growth rates and operating margins the company may be required to recognize impairment charges 

in particular the determination of fair value involves uncertainties around the forecasted cash flows as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate future business expectations those future expectations include but are not limited to the current and ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic and new product developments the company also considers the current and projected market and economic conditions amid the ongoing pandemic for the dental industry both in the us and globally when determining its assumptions 

a change in any of these estimates and assumptions used in the annual test as well as unfavorable changes in the ongoing covid19 pandemic or in the overall markets served by these reporting units among other factors could have a negative material impact to the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets and could result in a future impairment charge there can be no assurance that the companys future goodwill and indefinitelived impairment testing will not result in a material adverse impact to the companys results of operations 

information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of business acquired goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired or if a decision is made to sell a business judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred during the course of the year such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others when testing goodwill for impairment the company may assess qualitative factors for its reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill alternatively the company may bypass this qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test it is important to note that fair values which could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among reporting units and evaluated for impairment at that level the company’s reporting units are either an operating segment or one level below its operating segments as determined in accordance with asc 350 

effective 2021 and prospectively the company is performing its required annual goodwill impairment test as of april 1 rather than as of april 30 which was the companys previous practice the company believes this change is preferable as it more closely aligns with the timing of the companys strategic business planning process this change did not result in any delay acceleration or avoidance of impairment furthermore a retrospective application to prior periods is impracticable as the company is unable to objectively determine without the use of hindsight the assumptions which would be used in earlier periods 

the quantitative evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” as its valuation technique to measure the fair value for its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value the discounted cash flow model uses five to ten year forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate the significant assumptions and estimates involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows include but are not limited to the discount rates revenue growth rates including perpetual growth rates and future operating margin percentages of the reporting unit’s business these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years in the development of the forecasted cash flows the company applies revenue gross profit and operating expense assumptions taking into consideration historical trends as well as future expectations the revenue growth rate assumptions were developed in consideration of future expectations which included but were not limited to the current and ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic distribution channel changes impact from competition and new product developments for these reporting units the company also considers the current and projected market conditions for dental and medical device industries both in the us and globally when determining its assumptions operating cash flow assumptions may also be impacted by assumptions regarding benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending and working capital changes discount rates are estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions these rates are developed based on market participant data which included assumptions regarding the company’s weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows the company reconciled the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to its market capitalization which included a reasonable control premium based on market conditions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames trademarks and inprocess research and development and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets may be impaired or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred during the course of the year such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets the company performed this annual impairment test as of april 1 2021 in conjunction with the goodwill impairment annual test 

the fair value of acquired tradenames and trademarks is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty rate which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including revenue growth rates perpetual revenue growth rates royalty rates and discount rates other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment results 

no goodwill or indefinitelived intangible impairment was identified at april 1 2021 in conjunction with the annual test and no subsequent triggering events were identified for further information see note 12 goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

during the three months ended march 31 2020 prior to performance of the annual impairment test the company concluded that due to the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic on revenue and profitability a triggering event existed for four of the companys five reporting units containing a goodwill balance and all but two of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets as of march 31 2020 the first quarter goodwill impairment test resulted in an impairment charge of 157 million in the equipment  instruments reporting unit and an impairment charge of 39 million related to certain tradenames and trademarks related to the equipment  instruments reporting unit the intangible asset impairment charge was recorded in restructuring and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations the company further performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at april 30 2020 which did not result in any additional impairment in 2020 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 the company impaired 5 million of product tradenames and trademarks within the technologies  equipment segment the impaired indefinitelived intangible assets are tradenames and trademarks held within the equipment and instrument reporting unit the impairment was the result of a change in forecasted sales related to divestitures of nonstrategic product lines 

income taxes 

income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes the company’s tax expense includes us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested 

the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely at december 31 2021 the company has a valuation allowance of 267 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 

the company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing examinations by the tax authorities the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions throughout the world and in the normal course of business is examined by taxing authorities in those jurisdictions adjustments to the uncertain tax positions are recorded when taxing authority examinations are completed statutes of limitation are closed changes in tax laws occur or as new information comes to light with regard to the technical merits of the tax position 

liquidity and capital resources 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by higher sales in the current period partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital including a slower trend in collections relative to the prior year timing of payments to vendors and a buildup in inventory during the current period to meet recovered demand for the companys products for the year ended december 31 2021 the number of days for sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased by 7 days to 61 days as compared to 54 days at december 31 2020 and the number of days of sales in inventory increased by 6 days to 108 days at december 31 2021 as compared to 102 days at december 31 2020 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions by 830 million partially offset by higher capital expenditures of 55 million and less cash proceeds from liquidation of net investment hedges of 56 million the company estimates capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately 150 million to 170 million for the full year 2022 and expects these investments to include expansion of facilities to provide incremental space for growth and to consolidate operations for enhanced efficiencies 

the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by lower net borrowings of 851 million during 2021 compared to prior year higher stock repurchases of 60 million partially offset by greater proceeds from exercises of stock options of 40 million primarily as a result of this activity combined with a decrease of 76 million due to exchange rate fluctuations on debt denominated in foreign currencies the companys total borrowings decreased by a net 182 million during the year ended december 31 2021 

during the year ended december 31 2021 the company repurchased approximately 35 million shares under its open market share repurchase plan for a cost of 200 million at a volumeweighted average price of 5747 on july 28 2021 the board of directors of the company approved an increase in the value of shares of common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase program to 1 billion at december 31 2021 890 million of authorization remains available for future share repurchases additional share repurchases if any may be made through open market purchases rule 10b51 plans accelerated share repurchases privately negotiated transactions or other transactions in such amounts and at such times as the company deems appropriate based upon prevailing market and business conditions and other factors at december 31 2021 the company held 471 million shares of treasury stock 

the companys ratio of total net debt to total capitalization was as follows 



at december 31 2021 the company had a total remaining borrowing capacity of 560 million under lines of credit including lines available under its shortterm arrangements and revolving credit facility the companys borrowing capacity includes a 700 million credit facility from 2018 available through july 28 2024 the company also has available an aggregate 500 million under a us dollar commercial paper facility the 700 million revolver serves as a backup to the commercial paper facility thus the total available credit under the commercial paper facility and the multicurrency revolving credit facility in the aggregate is 700 million the company had 170 million outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper facility at december 31 2021 resulting in 530 million remaining available under the revolving credit and commercial paper facilities the company also has access to 41 million in uncommitted shortterm financing under lines of credit from various financial institutions the lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the company and the lending institutions at december 31 2021 the company has 11 million outstanding under shortterm borrowing arrangements 

the company’s revolving credit facility term loans and senior notes contain certain covenants relating to the companys operations and financial condition the most restrictive of these covenants are a ratio of total debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed 06 and a ratio of operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times in each case as such terms are defined in the relevant agreement any breach of any such covenants would result in a default under the existing debt agreements that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle the companys other lenders to accelerate their loans at december 31 2021 the company was in compliance with these covenants 

the company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance operating cash require ments capital expenditures and debt service from the current cash cash equivalents cash flows from operations and amounts available under its existing borrowing facilities the companys credit facilities are further discussed in note 15 financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operating activities and future foreign investments the company has the ability to repatriate cash to the us which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes foreign andor us state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements at december 31 2021  management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the united states and expects this to remain for the next twelve months the company has repatriated and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its nonus subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations however these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the company 

the company continues to review its debt portfolio and may refinance additional debt or add debt in the nearterm as interest rates remain at historically low levels the company believes there is sufficient liquidity available for the next twelve months 

off balance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2021 the company held 43 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the financial institutions own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheets these consignment agreements allow the company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time which is approximately the same time and for the same price as alloys are sold to the companys customers in the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements and if the company could not obtain other comparable arrangements the company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels for additional details see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  consignment arrangements of this form 10k 

contractual obligations 

the companys scheduled contractual cash obligations at december 31 2021 were as follows 



due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2021 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 42 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 17 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage risk of exposure to interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the company hedges various currencies primarily in euros swedish kronor canadian dollars british pounds swiss francs and japanese yen the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances 

the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company these cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months and do not change the underlying longterm foreign currency exchange risk the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the most significant of which are denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen and swedish kronor the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates 

currently the company uses both derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment at december 31 2021 a 10 weakening of the us dollar against all other currencies would decrease the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately 63 million 

interest rate risk management 

the company enters into financial instruments including derivatives that expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates the company uses a combination of financial instruments including longterm and shortterm financing variablerate commercial paper and derivative interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 

at december 31 2021 an increase of 1 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would decrease the companys fair value associated with the derivative interest rate swaps by approximately 15 million 

consignment arrangements 

the company holds on a consignment basis from various financials institutions the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products under these consignment arrangements the financial institutions own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this inventory on consignment as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheet the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through these agreements are cancellable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and may revise the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2021 the company had approximately 31000 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 43 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2021 the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 11 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

risks related to covid19 

the company’s revenue results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing covid19 outbreak 

the company is closely monitoring the global impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the recent resurgence of infections which has a significant negative effect and is expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on revenue results of operations cash flow and liquidity as a result of the global outbreak of covid19 which has been declared a global pandemic by the world health organization certain actions are being taken by governmental authorities and private enterprises globally to control the outbreak including restrictions on public gatherings travel and commercial operations temporary closures or decreased operations of dental offices as well as certain government mandates to limit certain dental procedures to those that could be considered emergency only these measures as well as guidance from professional dental associations recommending practitioners only perform emergency procedures and the impact of covid19 generally may result in or continue to result in 

• continuing or new partial or countrywide business lockdowns in various markets 

• temporary closures or significantly reduced operations at most of the company’s principal manufacturing and distribution locations including furloughing employees related to these locations which could reduce the company’s ability to manufacture and deliver products to customers 

• global reductions in customer demand for certain of the company’s products and services 

• uncertainty concerning vaccine efficacy and deployment 

• fear of exposure to or actual effects of the covid19 pandemic in countries where operations or customers are located and may lead to decreased procedures at dental offices the impacts include but are not limited to significant reductions or volatility in demand and increased pricing pressures for one or more of the companys products 

• decreased financial viability of the company’s suppliers which could cause them to change the terms on which they are willing to provide products 

• the inability or failure of customers to timely meet payment obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties which may have a negative material impact on the companys cash flow liquidity and statements of operations 

• a recession or prolonged period of economic slowdown which may significantly reduce the company’s cash flow and negatively impact the cost and access to capital and funding sources for the company 

• the company’s inability to maintain compliance with covenants under the revolving credit facilities or 

• the reduced availability of key employees or members of management due to quarantine or illness as a result of covid19 may temporarily affect the financial performance and results of operations if the company is unable to mitigate these or other similar risks its business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the company does not yet know the full extent of the impact of covid19 on its business operations or the global economy given the dynamic nature of the covid19 outbreak it is very difficult to predict the severity of the impact on the company’s business the extent of such impact will depend on future developments including the efficacy and availability of the covid19 vaccinations which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty including new information which may emerge concerning the spread and severity of outbreak and actions taken to address its impact among others there are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of the covid19 to the extent that the covid19 outbreak continues to adversely affect the business and financial performance it also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report 

risks related to our businesses 

the company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies 

as part of the restructuring plan adopted in november 2018 the company announced that it intends to grow revenues expand margins and simplify the business the company continues to generate a substantial portion of its revenue through a limited number of distributors which provide important sales distribution and service support to the enduser customers the companys two largest distributors patterson and henry schein accounted for approximately 24 of the company’s annual revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 and it is anticipated that they will continue to be the largest distribution contributors to dentsply sirona’s revenue through 2021 the company may be unable to execute its key strategic activities and investments due to the competing priorities of its distribution partners which may introduce competing private label generic or low cost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points particularly in the technologies  equipment segment products that are sold and serviced through distributor channels if these competing products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

additionally some parts of the dental market continue to be impacted by price competition which are driven in part by the consolidation of dental practices innovation and product advancements and the price sensitivity of end user customers there can be no assurance that the company’s distribution partners will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from the company or that they will continue to purchase any products at all if patterson or henry schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from dentsply sirona or if changes in the company’s promotional strategies and investments result in changes in the company’s distributor relationships or shortterm uneven growth it could have a material adverse effect on dentsply sirona’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies in part on its dealer and customer relationships and predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results these inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected these changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the dealers and customers economic conditions and customer preference for particular products there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any cyberattacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

due to the global nature of the company’s business and reliance on information systems to provide the company’s services the company uses webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering the company’s services as the breadth and complexity of company’s information systems continue to grow the company will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

• disruption impairment or failure of data centers telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms 

• security breaches of cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware and 

• excessive costs excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment 

any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” cyberattacks and other attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations the company’s network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruptions and the company may be the victim of cyberattacks targeted at the theft of financial assets intellectual property employee information personal information of individuals and customers or other sensitive information cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated like other large global companies the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time for example in january 2020 the company experienced a phishing cyberattack that propagated itself to certain of the companys servers however there was no evidence of data access manipulation or exfiltration although no such cyberattacks have had a material adverse effect on the company to date the company cannot provide assurance that despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of the company’s systems and the measures that the company or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats a future cyberattack would not result in material harm to the company or its business and results of operations particularly as cyberthreats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against for example certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources these data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of the company’s information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyberattacks could also cause the company to incur significant remediation costs disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data and the daytoday management of the company’s business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data disaster recovery plans where in place might not adequately protect the company in the event of a system failure further the company currently does not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions the company take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the company’s servers 

any of the foregoing incidents could also subject the company to liability expose the company to significant expense or cause significant harm to the company’s reputation all of which could result in lost revenues while dentsply sirona has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from cyberattacks technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results 

ineffective internal controls and lack of global standardized processes andor centralization of transaction management andor execution could result in control deficiencies and impact management’s assertions and financial reporting 

the company’s implementation of its business plans restructuring plans and compliance with regulations requires that dentsply sirona effectively manage its financial infrastructure including standardizing processes maintaining proper financial reporting and internal controls during this period of restructuring and organizational changes the company continues to focus on standardizing its processes improving its financial systems maintaining effective internal controls and centralizing transaction management andor execution so as to provide continued assurance with respect to the companys financial reports support the continued growth of the business and prevent financial misstatement or fraud nonstandardized processes and ineffective controls could result in an inability to aggregate and analyze data in a timely and accurate manner and may lead to inaccurate or incomplete financial and management reporting and delays in financial reporting to management regulators andor shareholders for example the company was unable to file its annual reports on form 10k for its fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 within the respectively prescribed time periods due to factors such as impairment triggering events the estimation of the income tax impact related to the tax cuts and jobs act management turnover and the review of internal controls of an immaterial business which was being shut down inaccurate or incomplete financial reporting and disclosures could also result in noncompliance with applicable business and regulatory requirements and the incurring of related penalties 

additionally internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or omissions because of certain limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud as a result even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if dentsply sirona fails to maintain adequate internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if dentsply sirona experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls dentsply sirona’s business and operating results could be harmed and dentsply sirona could fail to meet dentsply sirona’s reporting obligations 

further the company currently has disparate systems including enterprise resource planning systems across the organization which may result in the potential inability to obtain and analyze business data and increases in budgets due to higher costs stemming from system upgrades and may pose business partner connection challenges as a result the data required to manage the business may not be complete accurate or consistent resulting in the potential for misleading or inaccurate reporting for key business decisions additionally the structure of the organization may not be aligned to support the strategic business objectives which could result in potential operational deficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships and results of operations 

the company’s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time resulting in material operating costs and financial losses 

the company operates in more than 120 countries and the company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world potential events such as extreme weather natural disasters worker strikes and social and political actions such as brexit and trade wars or other events beyond our control could impact the company’s ongoing business operations including potential critical thirdparty vendor disruptions or failure to adhere to contractual obligations affecting our supply chain and manufacturing needs or the loss of critical information technology and telecommunications systems although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner such events could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

additionally a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products certain dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors dentsply sirona may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the company’s ability to deliver products to customers 

the success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions and dispositions 

with respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses the company may not achieve expected returns and other benefits associated with business combinations as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology in addition the company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities for example following the merger of dentsply international inc and sirona dental systems inc in 2016 the combined company recorded an aggregate of 33 billion in charges for the impairment of certain businesses and in 2018 announced significant cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

further acquisitions or dispositions may distract the company’s management’s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships with customers employees suppliers or other parties however the company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the company achieve its strategic objectives and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy 

after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may prevent the company from completing the transaction in a timely manner or at all from a workforce perspective risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include among others delays in anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impacts on the company’s relationship with labor unions adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

when the company decides to sell assets or a business the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives alternatively the company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the company had anticipated or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business such as through continuing equity ownership transition service agreements guarantees indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the acquired or divested business or other conditions outside the company’s control could affect its future financial results 

in the context of acquisitions there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations the company may not achieve the full revenue growth expectations and cost synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition for example the company acquired byte on december 31 2020 for approximately 10 billion the success of the companys acquisition of byte depends upon its ability to realize anticipated benefits which may not be realized on a timely basis or at all for a variety of reasons including but not limited to the following 

• challenges due to expanding into a new customer base through the directtoconsumer channel 

• the effect of future regulatory or legislative actions on the company or the industries and market segments in which it operates 

• the ability to hire and retain key personnel 

• continued support of dentsply sirona’s products by influential dental and medical professionals 

• the potential impact on relationships with customers suppliers competitors management and other employees 

• unexpected challenges related to scaling the operations 

• the continued strength of the clear aligner market and 

• unexpected changes or increased expenses relating to competitive factors in the clear aligner market 

additionally if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

the company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs the company has announced in the past and may announce in the future restructuring plans or other major initiatives from time to time including workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings the failure to efficiently execute such initiatives as part of the company’s business strategy could minimize the expected benefits to the organization resulting in potential impacts to ongoing operations and cost overruns 

additionally the company’s ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control the company may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred consistent with these efforts in november 2018 the board of directors of the company approved a plan to restructure and simplify the company’s business the goal of this restructuring is to drive annualized net sales growth of 3 to 4 and adjusted operating income margins of 22 by the end of 2022 as well as achieve net annual cost savings of 200 million to 225 million by 2021 in july 2020 the board of directors of the company approved an expansion of this plan that is intended to further optimize the company’s product portfolio and reduces operating expenses the product portfolio optimization has resulted in the divestiture or closure of certain underperforming businesses the operating expense reductions will come as a result of additional leverage from continued integration and simplification of the business as part of this expanded plan the company announced on august 6 2020 that it will exit its traditional orthodontics business as well as both exit and restructure certain portions of its laboratory business the company had initially anticipated onetime expenditures and charges of approximately 275 million yielding annual cost savings of 200 million to 225 million by 2021 the program expansion is expected to result in total charges of approximately 375 million and annual cost savings of approximately 250 million the company expects that these expanded actions will result in incremental global headcount reductions of 6 to 7 in addition to the original projections of 6 to 8 since november 2018 the company has incurred expenditures of approximately 310 million under this program of which approximately 120 million were noncash charges 

due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities and the quarterly phasing of related investments the company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits such as the goals for net sales growth adjusted operating income margins and cost savings or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits and its operations and business could be disrupted company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions and implementation may require the agreement of third parties such as labor unions or works councils risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impact on the company’s relationship with labor unions or works councils adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its sales growth operating income margins and other results of operations cash flows or financial condition or competitive position 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products 

the worldwide markets for dental and medical products is highly competitive and is driven by rapid and significant technological change change in consumer preferences new intellectual property associated with that technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions additionally some markets for products are also subject to significant negative price pressures dentsply sirona’s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona’s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the company’s investment in product development 

if the company fails to further develop its innovation efforts or if the company’s research and development does not effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences or market competition leading to technology or product obsolescence the company may lose market share and revenue additionally if the company’s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete dentsply sirona’s business could be negatively affected dentsply sirona has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities 

additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the company’s products obsolete 

the company recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges in 2017 2018 and 2020 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future 

the company acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles the company reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually the valuation models used to determine the fair value of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates the companys significant assumption in the valuation models include but are not limited to discount rates revenue growth rates perpetual revenue growth rates and operating margin percentages of the business any changes to the assumption and estimates made by management may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinitelived assets in our reporting unit may not be recoverable 

during 2017 2018 and 2020 the company had recorded an aggregate of 35 billion in charges for the impairment of certain businesses 

• in connection with the company’s april 30 2017 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended june 30 2017 the company recorded a 1093 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the cadcam imaging and treatment center equipment businesses in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to the cadcam and imaging businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 80 million for the three months ended june 30 2017 

• in preparing the financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the company identified a triggering event and recorded a 558 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the cadcam imaging and treatment center businesses in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to these businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 267 million for the three months ended december 31 2017 

• in connection with the company’s april 30 2018 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended june 30 2018 the company recorded a 1086 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the cadcam and imaging equipment businesses and the orthodontics business in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to the equipment businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 179 million for the three months ended june 30 2018 

• in preparing the financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2020 the company identified a triggering event and recorded a 157 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the equipment  instruments reporting unit within the technologies  equipment segment in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to these business and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 39 million for the three months ended march 31 2020 

the goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used such as discount rates revenue growth rates perpetual revenue growth rates and operating margin percentages of the business as well as current market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries in both the us and globally all of which have been unfavorably impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic if the assumptions and projections used in the analysis are not realized it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management’s assumptions underlying the company’s discounted cash flow model the company’s current estimates could vary significantly in the future which may result in a goodwill impairment charge at that time additionally valuations and impairments that are not complete accurate timely or appropriately recorded could result in potential financial misstatements and delays in impairment analysis

dentsply sirona’s failure to obtain issued patents and consequently to protect dentsply sirona’s proprietary technology could hurt dentsply sirona’s competitive position 

dentsply sirona’s success will depend in part on dentsply sirona’s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to dentsply sirona’s products technologies and processes both in the united states and in other countries risks and uncertainties that dentsply sirona faces with respect to dentsply sirona’s patents and patent applications include the following 

• the pending patent applications that dentsply sirona has filed or to which dentsply sirona has exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than dentsply sirona expects to result in issued patents 

• the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection 

• dentsply sirona may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable 

• the patents licensed or issued to dentsply sirona may not provide a competitive advantage 

• other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to dentsply sirona 

• disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by dentsply sirona and dentsply sirona’s respective licensors and 

• other companies may design around the technologies patented by dentsply sirona 

dentsply sirona’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or if dentsply sironas products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

dentsply sirona’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or misappropriate dentsply sirona’s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses to protect dentsply sirona’s rights to dentsply sirona’s intellectual property dentsply sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with dentsply sirona’s employees strategic partners and others dentsply sirona cannot assure you that any of dentsply sirona’s patents any of the patents of which dentsply sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to dentsply sirona or which we may license in the future will provide dentsply sirona with a competitive advantage or afford dentsply sirona protection against infringement by others or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties including dentsply sirona’s competitors the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of dentsply sirona’s proprietary information dentsply sirona may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights effective patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which dentsply sirona will offer or intend to offer dentsply sirona’s products any failure to adequately protect dentsply sirona’s intellectual property could devalue dentsply sirona’s proprietary content and impair dentsply sirona’s ability to compete effectively further defending dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 

litigation may also be necessary to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or to defend against any claims of infringement of rights owned by third parties that are asserted against dentsply sirona in addition dentsply sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign patent governing authorities to determine the priority of inventions which could result in substantial costs acquisitions by dentsply sirona of products or businesses that are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and the resulting changes to the competitive landscape of the industry could further increase this risk 

if dentsply sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings dentsply sirona may incur substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the attention of dentsply sirona’s technical and management personnel even if dentsply sirona ultimately prevails an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities allow dentsply sirona’s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from dentsply sirona prohibit dentsply sirona from marketing dentsply sirona’s products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all if dentsply sirona cannot obtain such licenses dentsply sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing dentsply sirona’s products 

the enforcement defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights including the united states patent and trademark office’s the european patent office’s and other foreign patent offices’ interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions as a result these proceedings are costly and timeconsuming and their outcome is uncertain litigation may be necessary to 

• assert against others or defend dentsply sirona against claims of patent or trademark infringement 

• enforce patents owned by or licensed to dentsply sirona from another party 

• protect dentsply sirona’s trade secrets or knowhow or 

• determine the enforceability scope and validity of dentsply sirona’s proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others 

changes in the company’s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets such as the covid19 pandemic may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

the company utilizes the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time the company’s continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including global economic conditions the condition of global credit markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing operating performance and credit ratings macroeconomic conditions such as the covid19 pandemic may have resulted in significant disruption in the credit markets which may adversely affect the company’s ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

on march 30 2020 sp global ratings affirmed our then credit rating but changed the outlook to negative from stable future adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market there is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund obligations or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding in addition the terms of future debt agreements could include additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility 

dentsply sirona has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsply sirona’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

the company has debt securities outstanding of approximately 23 billion dentsply sirona also has the ability to incur up to 700 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 2018 credit facility as discussed below and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsply sirona’s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• making it more difficult for the company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness 

• requiring dentsply sirona to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness which would reduce the funds the company has available for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions and 

• reducing dentsply sirona’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and market conditions 

dentsply sirona’s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios which the company is required to satisfy under the note purchase agreement dated december 11 2015 the company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 06 to 10 and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times in each case as such terms are defined in the note purchase agreement all of the company’s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios though no assurance can be given that dentsply sirona will be able to do so dentsply sirona’s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply sirona’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

additionally dentsply sirona’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through crossdefault provisions would entitle dentsply sirona’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any crossdefault provisions are triggered or to the extent that no other parties are willing to extend financing 

dentsply sirona hedging and cash management transactions may expose dentsply sirona to loss or limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains 

as part of dentsply sirona’s risk management program we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts while intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations these transactions may limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains or expose dentsply sirona to loss should dentsply sirona’s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions 

we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation and although dentsply sirona’s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective for accounting purposes as hedges of underlying physical transactions these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by dentsply sirona’s counterparties their failure to perform could result in dentsply sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of dentsply sirona’s exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing dentsply sirona’s exposure to changes in interest rates if such events occur dentsply sirona’s results of operations may be adversely affected 

most of dentsply sirona’s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure dentsply sirona’s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under dentsply sirona’s 2018 credit facility the failure of any bank in which we deposit dentsply sirona’s funds or that is part of dentsply sirona’s 2018 credit facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in dentsply sirona’s business 

certain of the company’s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending 

certain dental specialty products and dental equipment and related products that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in economic conditions decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect the companys business and result in a decline in sales and financial performance 

risks related to our international operations 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply sirona’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations consolidated balance sheets and cash flows of the company with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets although the company currently uses and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company 

due to the international nature of our business including increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately twothirds of the company’s sales are located in regions outside the united states in addition we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply sirona’s revenue operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

• economic and political instability 

• import or export licensing requirements 

• additional compliancerelated risks 

• trade restrictions and tariffs 

• product registration requirements 

• longer payment cycles 

• changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs 

• potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• trade policy changes 

specifically changes in or the imposition of tariffs could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to other countries these measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions the occurrence of a trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products our costs our customers and our suppliers which in turn could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates both of which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffs regulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

risks related to our regulatory environments 

dentsply sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances 

dentsply sirona must obtain certain approvals by and marketing clearances from governmental authorities including the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell dentsply sirona’s products in those countries these agencies regulate the marketing manufacturing labeling packaging advertising sale and distribution of medical devices the fda enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of xray emitting devices dentsply sirona’s products are currently regulated by such authorities and certain of dentsply sirona’s new products will require approval by or marketing clearance from various governmental authorities including the fda various states also impose similar regulations 

the fda review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products a 510k application is required in order to market certain classes of new or modified medical devices if specifically required by the fda a premarket approval or pma may be necessary such proceedings which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device are potentially expensive and time consuming they may delay or hinder a product’s timely entry into the marketplace moreover there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance failure to comply with the fda’s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties 

we are also subject to other federal state and local laws regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and inadequate employee training for critical compliance and regulatory requirements may result in the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules and regulations 

similar to the fda review process the eu review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products such proceedings which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product’s entry into the marketplace 

the company’s products will need to be certified under the european medical directive that has been revised to become the medical device regulation “mdr” dentsply sirona as well as all medical device manufacturers have to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under mdr in order to continue to sell those products in the european union “eu” the effectiveness of the new regulations originally scheduled to take effect in may 2020 have been delayed for one year until may 2021 however failure to have the upgrades to quality systems and processes completed by may 2021 could unfavorably impact the company’s sales and financial condition additionally the united kingdom “uk” has negotiated an exit from the eu brexit and as a result the eu ce marking will be recognized in the uk through june 2023 following june 2023 the uk may impose its own differing regulatory requirements for products being imported from the eu into the uk 

failure to comply with these rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on dentsply sirona’s business also these regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require dentsply sirona to make changes in dentsply sirona’s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other thirdparty payors for procedures using dentsply sirona’s products may cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

thirdparty payors including government health administration authorities private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and costeffectiveness of medical products and services while dentsply sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other thirdparty payors will have on future sales of our products there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

challenges may be asserted against the company’s products due to real or perceived quality health or environmental issues 

the company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products while the company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality health or environmental impact of the company’s products or certain raw material components of the company’s products all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply sirona contain mercury some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment in the united states the epa proposed in september 2014 certain effluent limitation guidelines and standards under the clean water act to help cut discharges of mercurycontaining dental amalgam to the environment the rule would require affected dentists to use best available technology amalgam separators and other best management practices to control mercury discharges to publiclyowned treatment works similar regulations exist in europe and in february 2016 the european union adopted a ratification package regarding the united nations minamata convention on mercury proposing rules restricting the use of dental amalgam to the encapsulated form and requiring the use of separators by dentists in september 2020 the fda issued an updated recommendation that certain people are at higher risk for health problems from mercurycontaining amalgam dental fillings such as pregnant women and their developing fetuses women who are planning to become pregnant nursing women and their newborns and infants children especially those younger than six years of age people with preexisting neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis alzheimer disease or parkinson disease people with impaired kidney function and people with a known allergy to mercury or other components of dental amalgam if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales of dental amalgam dentsply sirona also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenola commonly called bpa bpa is found in many everyday items such as plastic bottles foods detergents and toys and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a byproduct of other ingredients that have degraded or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants the fda currently allows the use of bpa in dental materials medical devices and food packaging nevertheless public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of bpa could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the company’s products that contain mercury or bpa adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products whether or not ultimately based on fact may have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and operating results and legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation andor product limitations or discontinuation 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures transfer pricing regulations country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

as a company with international operations we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made the actual outcome could differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and such differences may be material if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we take we could have additional tax liability and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and regulations and changes in interpretations of tax laws due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

our corporate structure which is subject to modification is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability the tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for transfer pricing which could increase our effective tax rate and such increase may be material in addition certain governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that could significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities the organization for economic cooperation and development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations including in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates it is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate and such increase may be material and impact our financial position 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to dentsply sirona’s operations which could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s business 

dentsply sirona is subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders relating to health care fraud including but not limited to the us federal antikickback statute the united kingdom’s bribery act 2010 c23 brazil’s clean company act 2014 law no 12846 and chinas national health and family planning commission “nhfpc” circulars no 49 and no 50 some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payors and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payors and programs 

the us government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise dentsply sirona’s marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the us physician payment sunshine act and similar foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders such as france’s loi bertrand and rules issued by denmark’s health and medicines authority the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

failure to comply with health care fraud laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on dentsply sirona’s business also these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require dentsply sirona to make changes in dentsply sirona’s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

we cannot predict whether changes in applicable laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders or the interpretation thereof or changes in dentsply sirona’s services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s business 

dentsply sirona’s business is subject to extensive complex and changing domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes directives circulars and orders that failure to comply with which if not complied with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 

dentsply sirona is subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders which are administered by various international federal and state governmental authorities including among others the fda the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury “ofac” the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of commerce “bis” the united states federal trade commission the united states department of justice the environmental protection agency “epa” and other similar domestic and foreign authorities these laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders include but are not limited to the united states food drug and cosmetic act the european council directive 9342eec on medical devices “mdd” 1993 and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” france’s data protection act of 1978 rev 2004 the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” the us federal antikickback statute and similar international antibribery and anticorruption laws the physician payments sunshine act regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals various environmental regulations such as the federal water pollution control act the “clean water act” the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act the “health care reform law” and regulations relating to trade import and export controls and economic sanctions such laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders are complex and are subject to change for example since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the united kingdom is derived from eu directives and regulations brexit could materially affect the regulatory regime applicable to our operations and customers with operations connected to the united kingdom any such changes to the regulatory regime could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may continue to be volatile 

dentsply sirona experiences significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors some of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to 

• the execution of the company’s restructuring plan 

• the complexity of the company’s organization 

• the timing of new product introductions by dentsply sirona and its competitors 

• the timing of industry trade shows 

• changes in customer inventory levels 

• developments in government or third party payor reimbursement policies 

• changes in customer preferences and product mix 

• the company’s ability to supply products to meet customer demand 

• fluctuations in manufacturing costs 

• changes in income tax laws and incentives which could create adverse tax consequences 

• competitors’ sales promotions 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 

• general economic conditions as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts which could cause its stock price to decline quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents and of delaware law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply sirona 

certain provisions of dentsply sirona’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply sirona such provisions include among others a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsply sirona’s bylaws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any “interested stockholder” with beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock 

general risks 

talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the company’s ability to grow the business 

the company’s success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage its human capital through talent acquisition engagement development and retention to achieve the company’s strategic initiatives the company needs to attract manage and retain employees with the right skills competencies and experiences to support the growth of the business and the failure to attract and retain such employees to fill key roles may adversely affect our business performance competitive position and future prospects the company also must retain a pipeline of team members to provide for continuity of succession for senior executive positions in order to attract and retain qualified employees the company must offer competitive compensation and effectively manage employee performance and development our inability to attract and retain talent may negatively impact business continuity new product launches and innovation initiatives further such organizational challenges may make it difficult to maintain the company’s culture resulting in employees not adhering to the desired values of the organization 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company faces the risk of purported securities class actions investigations by governmental agencies product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products in december 2020 the company and the sec entered into a settlement pursuant to which the company neither admitted nor denied the sec’s findings except as to the sec’s jurisdiction the company agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of section 13a of the exchange act and rules 12b20 and 13a13 thereunder and pay a 1 million civil penalty however the primary civil litigation which the company currently faces involve various putative class action suits in federal and state court alleging that the company and certain of its present and former officers and directors violated us securities laws by allegedly making false and misleading statements in connection with a february 2016 registration statement issued in connection with the merger with former sirona dental systems inc by the entity formerly known as dentsply international inc and in connection with the companys regular securities filings or public statements and to lawsuits related to the products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ insurance and product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

additionally dentsply sirona generally warrants each of dentsply sirona’s products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment or installation plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer the future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material successful product warranty claims brought against dentsply sirona could reduce dentsply sirona’s profits andor impair our financial condition and damage dentsply sirona’s reputation 

the company’s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event 

the company operates in more than 120 countries and its and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the company’s business and consolidated statements of operations any insurance maintained by the company may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions and emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future

business drivers 

the primary drivers of internal sales growth include macroeconomic factors global dental market demand innovation and new product launches by the company as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources including clinical education management believes that the company’s ability to execute its strategies should allow it to grow faster than the underlying dental market over time on a shortterm basis sudden changes in the macroeconomic environment such as those caused by the impacts of covid19 changes in strategy or distributor inventory levels can and have impacted the companys sales 

the company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis the company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency in addition management continues to evaluate the worldwide consolidation of operations and functions to further reduce costs while the company continues consolidation initiatives which can have an adverse impact on reported results in the short term the company expects that the continued benefits from these global efficiency efforts will improve its cost structure 

product innovation is a key component of the company’s overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in the dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental and healthcare products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that marketable products will be developed 

subject to the pace of the postpandemic recovery the company intends to continue pursuing opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings technologies and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships and acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates have experienced consolidation they remain fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income price increases promotional activities as well as changes in inventory levels at distributors contribute to this fluctuation the company typically implements most of its price increases in january or october of a given year across most of its businesses distributor inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase required minimum purchase commitments under agreements with key distributors may increase inventory levels in excess of retail demand these net inventory changes have impacted the company’s consolidated net sales and net income in the past and may continue to do so in the future over a given period or multiple periods in addition the company may from time to time engage in new distributor relationships that could cause fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income distributor inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history the company anticipates that inventory levels may fluctuate as dealers and customers manage the effects of covid19 on their businesses any of these fluctuations could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements for more information about the drivers of our business and related risks see part i item 1 business and part i item 1a risk factors

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions 

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals and evaluations of existing contingencies liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date more information on the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of acquired intangible assets is included in note 1 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also performs impairment assessments more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the excess amount similarly if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized on the intangible 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is dependent on significant assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates revenue growth rates and operating margins the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred during the course of the year such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values which could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among reporting units and evaluated for impairment at that level the company’s reporting units are either an operating segment or one level below its operating segments as determined in accordance with asc 350 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” as its valuation technique to measure the fair value for its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value the discounted cash flow model uses five to ten year forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on a multiple of earnings or by capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate the significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows include but are not limited to the discount rates revenue growth rates perpetual revenue growth rates and future operating margin percentages of the reporting unit’s business these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years in the development of the forecasted cash flows the company applies revenue gross profit and operating expense assumptions taking into consideration historical trends as well as future expectations the revenue growth rate assumptions were developed in consideration of future expectations which included but were not limited to the current and ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic distribution channel changes impact from competition and new product development changes for these reporting units the company also considers the current and projected market conditions for dental and medical device industries both in the us and globally when determining its assumptions operating cash flow assumptions may also be impacted by assumptions regarding benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending and working capital changes discount rates are estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions these rates are developed based on market participant data which included assumptions regarding the company’s weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented 

the use of estimates and the development of assumptions results in uncertainties around forecasted cash flows due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a decline in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a material charge to earnings 

annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames and trademarks and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually as of april 30 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets may be impaired or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred during the course of the year such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets 

the fair value of acquired tradenames and trademarks is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty rate which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including revenue growth rates perpetual revenue growth rates royalty rates and discount rates other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment results 

during the three months ended march 31 2020 prior to performance of the annual impairment test the company concluded that due to the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic on revenue and profitability a triggering event existed for four of the companys five reporting units containing a goodwill balance as of march 31 2020 the first quarter goodwill impairment test resulted in an impairment charge of 157 million in the equipment  instruments reporting unit no goodwill impairment was identified at april 30 2020 in conjunction with the annual test and no subsequent triggering events were identified for further information see note 10 goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

during the three months ended march 31 2020 prior to performance of the annual test the company identified a triggering event and consequently performed an interim impairment test which resulted in an impairment charge of 39 million which was recorded in restructuring and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations the impaired indefinitelived intangibles assets are tradenames and trademarks related to the equipment  instruments reporting unit for which the tradenames and trademarks for one business unit in the equipment  instruments reporting unit makes up a significant portion of the companys total 39 million intangible asset impairment charge the impairment charge was primarily driven by a decline in forecasted sales due to the covid19 pandemic 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 the company impaired 5 million of product tradenames and trademarks within the technologies  equipment segment the impaired indefinitelived intangible assets are tradenames and trademarks held within the equipment and instrument reporting unit the impairment was the result of a change in forecasted sales related to divestitures of nonstrategic product lines the company previously recorded an impairment charge of 179 million in the twelve months ended december 31 2018 for the impairment of tradenames and trademarks related to the cadcam imaging and instrument businesses the impairment charge was primarily driven by a decline in forecasted sales resulting from increased competition and the impact of lowcost competitive products consistent with the current year charges these amounts were recorded in restructuring and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company also assessed the annual impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2020 which largely consist of acquired tradenames and trademarks in conjunction with the annual impairment tests of goodwill the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets contain uncertainties and any changes to these assumptions could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment at april 30 2020 the company did not identify any impairment triggers for the indefinitelived intangible assets for further information see note 10 goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges is a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred 

income taxes 

income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes the company’s tax expense includes us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested 

the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely at december 31 2020 the company has a valuation allowance of 287 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 

the company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing examinations by the tax authorities the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions throughout the world and in the normal course of business is examined by taxing authorities in those jurisdictions adjustments to the uncertain tax positions are recorded when taxing authority examinations are completed statutes of limitation are closed changes in tax laws occur or as new information comes to light with regard to the technical merits of the tax position

the company continues to review its debt portfolio and may refinance additional debt or add debt in the nearterm as interest rates remain at historically low levels the company believes there is sufficient liquidity available for the next twelve months 

off balance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2020 the company held 54 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the financial institutions own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheets these consignment agreements allow the company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time which is approximately the same time and for the same price as alloys are sold to the companys customers in the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements and if the company could not obtain other comparable arrangements the company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels for additional details see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  consignment arrangements of this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the company hedges various currencies primarily in euros swedish kronor canadian dollars british pounds swiss francs japanese yen and australian dollars the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company these cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months and do not change the underlying longterm foreign currency exchange risk the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the most significant of which are denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen and swedish kronor the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment 

at december 31 2020 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would improve the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately 5 million 

interest rate risk management 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company early terminated its existing 246 million euro cross currency basis swap and entered into a new 263 million euro cross currency basis swap maturing in august 2021 the cross currency basis swap is designated as a hedge of net investments this contract effectively converts the 296 million bond coupon from 41 to 12 

at december 31 2020 an increase of 1 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would not have a significant impact on the company’s annual interest expense as the company’s debt portfolio comprises primarily of fixed rate debt at december 31 2020 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancellable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 36000 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 54 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2020 the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 09 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply sirona’s business financial condition or future results dentsply sirona may be affected by risks not yet known or other uncertainties 

the company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies 

as part of the restructuring plan adopted in november 2018 the company announced that it intends to grow revenues expand margins and simplify the business the company continues to generate a substantial portion of its revenue through a limited number of distributors which provide important sales distribution and service support to the enduser customers the companys two largest distributors patterson and henry schein accounted for approximately 20 of the company’s annual revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 and it is anticipated that they will continue to be the largest distribution contributors to dentsply sirona’s revenue through 2021 the company may be unable to execute its key strategic activities and investments due to the competing priorities of its distribution partners which may introduce competing private label generic or low cost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points particularly in the technologies  equipment segment products that are sold and serviced through distributor channels if these competing products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

additionally some parts of the dental market continue to be impacted by price competition which are driven in part by the consolidation of dental practices innovation and product advancements and the price sensitivity of end user customers there can be no assurance that the company’s distribution partners will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from the company or that they will continue to purchase any products at all if patterson or henry schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from dentsply sirona or if changes in the company’s promotional strategies and investments result in changes in the company’s distributor relationships or shortterm uneven growth it could have a material adverse effect on dentsply sirona’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies in part on its dealer and customer relationships and predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results these inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected these changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the dealers and customers economic conditions and customer preference for particular products there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any cyberattacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

due to the global nature of the company’s business and reliance on information systems to provide the company’s services the company uses webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering the company’s services as the breadth and complexity of company’s information systems continue to grow the company will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

• disruption impairment or failure of data centers telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms 

• security breaches of cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware and 

• excessive costs excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment 

any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” cyberattacks and other attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations the company’s network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruptions and the company may be the victim of cyberattacks targeted at the theft of financial assets intellectual property employee information personal information of individuals and customers or other sensitive information cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated like other large global companies the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time for example in january 2020 the company experienced a phishing cyberattack that propagated itself to certain of the company’s servers but to the knowledge of the company it was contained to the affected servers by the company’s information technology tools and processes although no such cyberattacks have had a material 

adverse effect on the company to date the company cannot provide assurance that despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of the company’s systems and the measures that the company or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats a future cyberattack would not result in material harm to the company or its business and results of operations particularly as cyberthreats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against for example certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources these data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of the company’s information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyberattacks could also cause the company to incur significant remediation costs disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data and the daytoday management of the company’s business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data disaster recovery plans where in place might not adequately protect the company in the event of a system failure further the company currently does not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions the company take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the company’s servers 

any of the foregoing incidents could also subject the company to liability expose the company to significant expense or cause significant harm to the company’s reputation which could result in lost revenues while dentsply sirona has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from cyberattacks technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results 

ineffective internal controls and lack of global standardized processes andor centralization of transaction management andor execution could result in control deficiencies and impact management’s assertions and financial reporting 

the company’s implementation of its business plans restructuring plans and compliance with regulations requires that dentsply sirona effectively manage its financial infrastructure including standardizing processes maintaining proper financial reporting and internal controls during this period of restructuring and organizational changes the company continues to focus on standardizing its processes improving its financial systems maintaining effective internal controls and centralizing transaction management andor execution so as to provide continued assurance with respect to the companys financial reports support the continued growth of the business and prevent financial misstatement or fraud nonstandardized processes and ineffective controls could result in an inability to aggregate and analyze data in a timely and accurate manner and may lead to financial and management reporting that is inaccurate or incomplete and delays in financial reporting to management regulators andor shareholders for example the company was unable to file its annual reports on form 10k for its fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 within the respectively prescribed time periods due to factors such as impairment triggering events the estimation of the income tax impact related to the tax cuts and jobs act management turnover and the review of internal controls of an immaterial business which was being shut down inaccurate or incomplete financial reporting and disclosures could also result in noncompliance with applicable business and regulatory requirements and the incurring of related penalties 

additionally internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or omissions because of certain limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud as a result even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if dentsply sirona fails to maintain adequate internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if dentsply sirona experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls dentsply sirona’s business and operating results could be harmed and dentsply sirona could fail to meet dentsply sirona’s reporting obligations 

further the company currently has disparate systems including enterprise resource planning systems across the organization which may result in the potential inability to obtain and analyze business data and increases in budgets due to higher costs stemming from system upgrades and may pose business partner connection challenges as a result the data required to manage the business may not be complete accurate or consistent resulting in the potential for misleading or inaccurate reporting for key business decisions additionally the structure of the organization may not be aligned to support the strategic business objectives which could result in potential operational deficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships and results of operations 

the company’s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time resulting in material operating costs and financial losses 

the company operates in more than 120 countries and the company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world potential events such as extreme weather natural disasters worker strikes and social and political actions such as brexit and trade wars or other events beyond our control could impact the company’s ongoing business operations including potential critical thirdparty vendor disruptions or failure to adhere to contractual obligations affecting our supply chain and manufacturing needs or the loss of critical information technology and telecommunications systems although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner such events could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales the efficiency of our operations and our financial results 

additionally a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products certain dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors dentsply sirona may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the company’s ability to deliver products to customers 

talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the company’s ability to grow the business 

the company’s success is dependent on our ability to fill key roles and develop employees to achieve the company’s strategic initiatives the company needs employees with the right skills competencies and experiences to support the growth of the business and failure to attract and retain employees to fill key roles may adversely affect our business performance competitive position and future prospects the company also must retain a pipeline of team members to provide for continuity of succession for senior executive positions in order to attract and retain qualified employees the company must offer competitive compensation and effectively manage employee performance and development our inability to attract and retain talent may negatively impact business continuity new product launches and innovation initiatives further such organizational challenges may make it difficult to maintain the company’s culture resulting in employees not adhering to the desired values of the organization 

the company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs the company has announced in the past and may announce in the future restructuring plans or other major initiatives from time to time including workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings the failure to efficiently execute such initiatives as part of the company’s business strategy could minimize the expected benefits to the organization resulting in potential impacts to ongoing operations and cost overruns 

additionally the company’s ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control the company may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred consistent with these efforts in november 2018 the board of directors of the company approved a plan to restructure the company’s business to support revenue growth and margin expansion and to simplify its organization the company expects to incur approximately 275 million in onetime expenditures and charges through 2021 the company anticipates a net reduction in global workforce of approximately 6 to 8 as of december 31 2019 the company has achieved savings of approximately 88 million and headcount reduction of approximately 7 during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded expenses and charges of approximately 192 million related to this restructuring plan of which approximately 73 million were noncash charges there can be no assurance that the cost reductions and results will be achieved 

due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities and the quarterly phasing of related investments the company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits and its operations and business could be disrupted company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions and implementation may require the agreement of third parties such as labor unions or works councils risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impact on the company’s relationship with labor unions or works councils adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company faces the risk of purported securities class actions investigations by governmental agencies product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products the primary litigation which the company currently faces involve various putative class action suits in federal and state court alleging that the company and certain of its present and former officers and directors violated us securities laws by allegedly making false and misleading statements in connection with a february 2016 registration statement issued in connection with the merger with former sirona dental systems inc by the entity formerly known as dentsply international inc and in connection with the companys regular securities filings or public statements and to lawsuits related to the products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including directors and officers’ insurance and product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

additionally dentsply sirona generally warrants each of dentsply sirona’s products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment or installation plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer the future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material successful product warranty claims brought against dentsply sirona could reduce dentsply sirona’s profits andor impair our financial condition and damage dentsply sirona’s reputation 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products or maintain approvals for existing products 

the worldwide markets for dental and medical products is highly competitive and is driven by rapid and significant technological change change in consumer preferences new intellectual property associated with that technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions additionally some markets for products such as orthodontics are also subject to significant negative price pressures dentsply sirona’s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona’s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the company’s investment in product development 

if the company fails to further develop its innovation efforts or if the company’s research and development does not effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences or market competition leading to technology or product obsolescence the company may lose market share and revenue additionally if the company’s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete dentsply sirona’s business could be negatively affected 

dentsply sirona has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona will be able to continue to develop innovative products or that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable us or international government or regulatory authorities or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the company’s products obsolete 

the company’s products will need to be certified under the european medical directive that has been revised to become the medical device regulation “mdr” dentsply sirona as well as all medical device manufacturers have to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under mdr in order to continue to sell those products in the european union “eu” the new regulations are scheduled to become effective in may 2020 failure to have the upgrades to quality systems and processes completed by may 2020 could unfavorably impact the company’s sales and financial condition 

additionally the united kingdom “uk” has negotiated an exit from the eu brexit terms of the brexit agreement could impact the uk’s ability to certify medical devices for sale in the eu the company has been working on alternative plans for the impacted products the inability to certify the company’s products for sale in the eu could unfavorable impact the company’s sales 

dentsply sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances 

dentsply sirona must obtain certain approvals by and marketing clearances from governmental authorities including the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell dentsply sirona’s products in those countries these agencies regulate the marketing manufacturing labeling packaging advertising sale and distribution of medical devices the fda enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of xray emitting devices dentsply sirona’s products are currently regulated by such authorities and certain of dentsply sirona’s new products will require approval by or marketing clearance from various governmental authorities including the fda various states also impose similar regulations 

the fda review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products a 510k application is required in order to market certain classes of new or modified medical devices if specifically required by the fda a premarket approval or pma may be necessary such proceedings which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device are potentially expensive and time consuming they may delay or hinder a product’s timely entry into the marketplace moreover there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance failure to comply with the fda’s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties 

we are also subject to other federal state and local laws regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and inadequate employee training for critical compliance and regulatory requirements may result in the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules and regulations 

similar to the fda review process the eu review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products such proceedings which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product’s entry into the marketplace 

failure to comply with these rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on dentsply sirona’s business also these regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require dentsply sirona to make changes in dentsply sirona’s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply sirona’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations consolidated balance sheets and cash flows of the company with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets although the company currently uses and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company 

due to the international nature of our business including increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately twothirds of the company’s sales are located in regions outside the united states in addition we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply sirona’s revenue operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

• economic and political instability 

• import or export licensing requirements 

• additional compliancerelated risks 

• trade restrictions and tariffs 

• product registration requirements 

• longer payment cycles 

• changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs 

• potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• trade policy changes 

certain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates both of which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffs regulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the company recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges in 2017 and 2018 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future 

the company acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles the company reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually events or changes indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include reduced future cash flow estimates slower growth rates in industry segments in which the company participates and a decline in our stock price and market capitalization the company may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting the companys results of operations 

during 2017 and 2018 the company had recorded an aggregate of 33 billion in charges for the impairment of certain businesses 

• in connection with the company’s april 30 2017 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended june 30 2017 the company recorded a 10929 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the cadcam imaging and treatment center equipment businesses in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to the cadcam and imaging businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 798 million for the three months ended june 30 2017 

• in preparing the financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the company identified a triggering event and recorded a 5580 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the cadcam imaging and treatment center businesses in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to these businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 2669 million for the three months ended december 31 2017 

• in connection with the company’s april 30 2018 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended june 30 2018 the company recorded a 10858 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the cadcam and imaging equipment businesses and the orthodontics business in addition the company tested the indefinitelived intangible assets related to the equipment businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of 1792 million for the three months ended june 30 2018 

these charges resulted from changes in the company’s estimates of discounted cash flows which in turn resulted from changes in management’s assumptions such as future revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management’s assumptions underlying the company’s discounted cash flow model the company’s current estimates could vary significantly in the future which may result in a goodwill impairment charge at that time additionally valuations and impairments that are not complete accurate timely or appropriately recorded could result in potential financial misstatements and delays in impairment analysis 

see note 10 goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 8 of this form 10k 

changes in the company’s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

the company utilizes the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time the companys credit ratings have fluctuated from time to time and future adverse changes in our credit ratings or disruptions in the credit markets may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including our access to the unsecured borrowing market we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

the company’s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event 

the company operates in more than 120 countries and its and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the company’s business and consolidated statements of operations any insurance maintained by the company may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions and emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future for example in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus surfaced in china at this point the extent to which the coronavirus may impact the company financial results is uncertain 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may continue to be volatile 

dentsply sirona experiences significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors some of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to 

• the execution of the company’s restructuring plan 

• the complexity of the company’s organization 

• the timing of new product introductions by dentsply sirona and its competitors 

• the timing of industry trade shows 

• changes in customer inventory levels 

• developments in government or third party payor reimbursement policies 

• changes in customer preferences and product mix 

• the company’s ability to supply products to meet customer demand 

• fluctuations in manufacturing costs 

• changes in income tax laws and incentives which could create adverse tax consequences 

• competitors’ sales promotions 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 

• general economic conditions as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts which could cause its stock price to decline quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures transfer pricing regulations country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

as a company with international operations we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made the actual outcome could differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and such differences may be material if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we take we could have additional tax liability and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and regulations and changes in interpretations of tax laws 

our corporate structure which is subject to modification is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability the tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for transfer pricing which could increase our effective tax rate and such increase may be material in addition certain governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that could significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities the organization for economic cooperation and development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations including in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates it is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate and such increase may be material and impact our financial position 

dentsply sirona’s failure to obtain issued patents and consequently to protect dentsply sirona’s proprietary technology could hurt dentsply sirona’s competitive position 

dentsply sirona’s success will depend in part on dentsply sirona’s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to dentsply sirona’s products technologies and processes both in the united states and in other countries risks and uncertainties that dentsply sirona faces with respect to dentsply sirona’s patents and patent applications include the following 

• the pending patent applications that dentsply sirona has filed or to which dentsply sirona has exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than dentsply sirona expects to result in issued patents 

• the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection 

• dentsply sirona may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable 

• the patents licensed or issued to dentsply sirona may not provide a competitive advantage 

• other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to dentsply sirona 

• disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by dentsply sirona and dentsply sirona’s respective licensors and 

• other companies may design around the technologies patented by dentsply sirona 

dentsply sirona’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or if dentsply sironas products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

dentsply sirona’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or misappropriate dentsply sirona’s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses to protect dentsply sirona’s rights to dentsply sirona’s intellectual property dentsply sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with dentsply sirona’s employees strategic partners and others dentsply sirona cannot assure you that any of dentsply sirona’s patents any of the patents of which dentsply sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to dentsply sirona or which we may license in the future will provide dentsply sirona with a competitive advantage or afford dentsply sirona protection against infringement by others or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties including dentsply sirona’s competitors the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of dentsply sirona’s proprietary information dentsply sirona may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights effective patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which dentsply sirona will offer or intend to offer dentsply sirona’s products any failure to adequately protect dentsply sirona’s intellectual property could devalue dentsply sirona’s proprietary content and impair dentsply sirona’s ability to compete effectively further defending dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 

litigation may also be necessary to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or to defend against any claims of infringement of rights owned by third parties that are asserted against dentsply sirona in addition dentsply sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign patent governing authorities to determine the priority of inventions which could result in substantial costs acquisitions by dentsply sirona of products or businesses that are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and the resulting changes to the competitive landscape of the industry could further increase this risk 

if dentsply sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings dentsply sirona may incur substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the attention of dentsply sirona’s technical and management personnel even if dentsply sirona ultimately prevails an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities allow dentsply sirona’s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from dentsply sirona prohibit dentsply sirona from marketing dentsply sirona’s products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all if dentsply sirona cannot obtain such licenses dentsply sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing dentsply sirona’s products 

the enforcement defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights including the united states patent and trademark office’s the european patent office’s and other foreign patent offices’ interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions as a result these proceedings are costly and timeconsuming and their outcome is uncertain litigation may be necessary to 

• assert against others or defend dentsply sirona against claims of patent or trademark infringement 

• enforce patents owned by or licensed to dentsply sirona from another party 

• protect dentsply sirona’s trade secrets or knowhow or 

• determine the enforceability scope and validity of dentsply sirona’s proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others 

the success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions and dispositions 

with respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses the company may not achieve expected returns and other benefits associated with business combinations as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology in addition the company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities for example following the merger of dentsply international inc and sirona dental systems inc in 2016 the combined company recorded an aggregate of 33 billion in charges for the impairment of certain businesses and in 2018 announced significant cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

further acquisitions or dispositions may distract the company’s management’s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships with customers employees suppliers or other parties however the company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the company achieve its strategic objectives and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy 

after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may prevent the company from completing the transaction in a timely manner or at all from a workforce perspective risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include among others delays in anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impacts on the company’s relationship with labor unions adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

when the company decides to sell assets or a business the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives alternatively the company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the company had anticipated or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business such as through continuing equity ownership transition service agreements guarantees indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the acquired or divested business or other conditions outside the company’s control could affect its future financial results 

in the context of acquisitions there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations the company may not achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other thirdparty payors for procedures using dentsply sirona’s products may cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

thirdparty payors including government health administration authorities private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and costeffectiveness of medical products and services while dentsply sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other thirdparty payors will have on future sales of our products there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

certain of the company’s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending 

certain dental specialty products and dental equipment and related products that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in economic conditions decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect the companys business and result in a decline in sales and financial performance 

dentsply sirona has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsply sirona’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

the company has debt securities outstanding of approximately 14 billion dentsply sirona also has the ability to incur up to 7000 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as discussed below and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsply sirona’s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• making it more difficult for the company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness 

• requiring dentsply sirona to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness which would reduce the funds the company has available for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions and 

• reducing dentsply sirona’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and market conditions 

dentsply sirona’s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios which the company is required to satisfy under the note purchase agreement dated december 11 2015 the company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 06 to 10 and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times in each case as such terms are defined in the note purchase agreement all of the company’s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios though no assurance can be given that dentsply sirona will be able to do so dentsply sirona’s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply sirona’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

additionally dentsply sirona’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through crossdefault provisions would entitle dentsply sirona’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any crossdefault provisions are triggered or to the extent that no other parties are willing to extend financing 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to dentsply sirona’s operations which could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s business 

dentsply sirona is subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders relating to health care fraud including but not limited to the us federal antikickback statute the united kingdom’s bribery act 2010 c23 brazil’s clean company act 2014 law no 12846 and chinas national health and family planning commission “nhfpc” circulars no 49 and no 50 some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payors and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payors and programs 

the us government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise dentsply sirona’s marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the us physician payment sunshine act and similar foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders such as france’s loi bertrand and rules issued by denmark’s health and medicines authority the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

failure to comply with health care fraud laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on dentsply sirona’s business also these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require dentsply sirona to make changes in dentsply sirona’s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

we cannot predict whether changes in applicable laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders or the interpretation thereof or changes in dentsply sirona’s services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s business 

dentsply sirona’s business is subject to extensive complex and changing domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes directives circulars and orders that failure to comply with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 

dentsply sirona is subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders which are administered by various international federal and state governmental authorities including among others the fda the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury “ofac” the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of commerce “bis” the united states federal trade commission the united states department of justice the environmental protection agency “epa” and other similar domestic and foreign authorities these laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders include but are not limited to the united states food drug and cosmetic act the european council directive 9342eec on medical devices “mdd” 1993 and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” france’s data protection act of 1978 rev 2004 the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” the us federal antikickback statute and similar international antibribery and anticorruption laws the physician payments sunshine act regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals various environmental regulations such as the federal water pollution control act the “clean water act” the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act the “health care reform law” and regulations relating to trade import and export controls and economic sanctions such laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders are complex and are subject to change for example since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the united kingdom is derived from eu directives and regulations brexit could materially affect the regulatory regime applicable to our operations and customers with operations 

connected to the united kingdom any such changes to the regulatory regime could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

dentsply sirona hedging and cash management transactions may expose dentsply sirona to loss or limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains 

as part of dentsply sirona’s risk management program we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts while intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations these transactions may limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains or expose dentsply sirona to loss should dentsply sirona’s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions 

we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation and although dentsply sirona’s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective for accounting purposes as hedges of underlying physical transactions these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by dentsply sirona’s counterparties their failure to perform could result in dentsply sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of dentsply sirona’s exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing dentsply sirona’s exposure to changes in interest rates if such events occur dentsply sirona’s results of operations may be adversely affected 

most of dentsply sirona’s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure dentsply sirona’s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under dentsply sirona’s multicurrency revolving credit facility the failure of any bank in which we deposit dentsply sirona’s funds or that is part of dentsply sirona’s multicurrency revolving credit facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in dentsply sirona’s business

the company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products while the company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality health or environmental impact of the company’s products or certain raw material components of the company’s products all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply sirona contain mercury some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment in the united states the epa proposed in september 2014 certain effluent limitation guidelines and standards under the clean water act to help cut discharges of mercurycontaining dental amalgam to the environment the rule would require affected dentists to use best available technology amalgam separators and other best management practices to control mercury discharges to publiclyowned treatment works similar regulations exist in europe and in february 2016 the european union adopted a ratification package regarding the united nations minamata convention on mercury proposing rules restricting the use of dental amalgam to the encapsulated form and requiring the use of separators by dentists if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales of dental amalgam dentsply sirona also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenola commonly called bpa bpa is found in many everyday items such as plastic bottles foods detergents and toys and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a byproduct of 

other ingredients that have degraded or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants the fda currently allows the use of bpa in dental materials medical devices and food packaging nevertheless public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of bpa could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the company’s products that contain mercury or bpa adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products whether or not ultimately based on fact may have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and operating results and legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation andor product limitations or discontinuation 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents and of delaware law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply sirona

the company defines “constant currency” sales growth as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding precious metal content and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates this impact is calculated by comparing currentperiod revenues to priorperiod revenues with both periods converted to the us dollar using local currency foreign exchange rates for each month of the prior period for the currencies in which the company does business the company defines “internal sales growth as constant currency sales growth excluding the impacts of net acquisitions and divestitures and discontinued products 

business drivers 

the primary drivers of internal sales growth include macroeconomic factors global dental market demand innovation and new product launches by the company as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources including clinical education management believes that the company’s ability to execute its strategies should allow it to grow faster than the underlying dental market over time on a short term basis changes in strategy or distributor inventory levels can impact the companys internal sales growth 

the company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis the company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency in addition management continues to evaluate the worldwide consolidation of operations and functions to further reduce costs while the company continues consolidation initiatives which can have an adverse impact on reported results the company expects that the continued benefits from these global efficiency efforts will improve its cost structure 

in connection with these initiatives the board of directors of the company approved a plan to restructure the company’s business to drive revenue growth and margin expansion and to simplify the organization with the understanding that the restructuring plan may continue to evolve as the company progresses through the continued planning and execution of the plan the plan includes a restructuring of the business through streamlining the organization and consolidating functions the restructuring plan anticipates a net reduction in the company’s global workforce of approximately 6 to 8 from the november 2018 levels and the company will consult with employee representation in connection with the execution of the restructuring plan where required the companys goal is that the restructuring will result in annualized revenue growth of 3 to 4 an adjusted operating income margin of 20 by the end of the year 2020 an adjusted operating income margin of 22 by the year 2022 and 200 million to 225 million in net annual cost savings by 2021 as of december 31 2019 the company has achieved savings of approximately 88 million and headcount reduction of approximately 7 the company expects to incur approximately 275 million in onetime expenditures and charges for the year ended december 31 2019 the company has recorded expenses and charges of approximately 192 million related to this restructuring plan of which approximately 73 million were noncash charges there can be no assurance that the cost reductions and results will be achieved 

as part of this restructuring plan the company has introduced five key operating principles in order to achieve this goal 

• approach customers as one put the customer at the center of how dentsply sirona is organized the company is creating one integrated approach to customer service direct and indirect selling and clinical education to strengthen the relationship with the customer and better serve the customers needs 

• assume greater responsibility for dentsply sirona’s demand creation to better support dealer partners and enduser customers the company launched a sales force effectiveness program with a view to improving returns on sales and marketing investments 

• ensure that innovation is substantial and supported create a comprehensive rd program that prioritizes spending across the entire company portfolio resulting in more impactful innovations each year 

• lead in clinical education dentsply sirona is investing to further its leadership position through local training events and enhancing online training presence to strengthen the relationship with the dental professionals 

• take advantage of scale the company is focused on integrating its dental product portfolios to unlock operational efficiencies including performance improvements in procurement logistics manufacturing sales force and marketing programs in addition dentsply sirona is taking significant measures to simplify the business in combination these initiatives will improve organizational efficiency and better leverage the company’s selling general and administrative infrastructure 

product innovation is a key component of the company’s overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in the dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental healthcare consumable and dental technology products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings technologies and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships and acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates have experienced consolidation they remain fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income price increases promotional activities as well as changes in inventory levels at distributors contribute to this fluctuation the company typically implements most of its price increases in october or january of a given year across most of its businesses distributor inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase required minimum purchase commitments under agreements with key distributors may increase inventory levels in excess of retail demand these net inventory changes have impacted the company’s consolidated net sales and net income in the past and may continue to do so in the future over a given period or multiple periods in addition the company may from time to time engage in new distributor relationships that could cause quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income distributor inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history any of these fluctuations could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in 2018 and 2017 the company was impacted by the transition in distribution strategy with patterson and henry schein in 2017 the company signed new distribution agreements with patterson and henry schein for the company’s equipment products the company shipped initial stocking orders for the equipment products to henry schein under the agreements primarily in the second and third quarters of 2017 which resulted in unfavorable yearoveryear sales growth comparisons based on the company’s estimate yearoveryear changes in distributor inventories associated with these agreements negatively impacted the company’s reported sales growth for the year ended december 31 2018 by approximately 127 million based on the company’s estimate distributor inventories increased for the year ended december 31 2017 by approximately 27 million as compared to a decrease of approximately 100 million for the full year 2018 for more information about the drivers of our business and related risks see part i item 1 business and part i item 1a risk factors 

impact of foreign currencies 

due to the company’s significant international presence movements in foreign currency exchange may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the company’s net sales located in regions outside the united states the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

for the year ended december 31 2019 certain reclassifications have been made to data for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 in order to conform to the current year presentation specifically during the three months ended march 31 2019 the company moved the dental laboratory business into the consumables segment as the products sold from this business are typically made on a recurring basis and have similar sales and operating characteristics as the other businesses in this segment the company moved the orthodontics business into the technologies  equipment segment to take advantage of the synergies related to digital planning and treatment within this segment the company also moved the instruments business into the technologies  equipment segment in order to take advantage of the synergies that stem from pairing equipment with instruments which are often sold in conjunction with each other the segment information reflects the revised structure for all periods shown

2019 compared to 2018 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the companys sales growth which excludes precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency sales growth by segment and geographic region and 2 internal sales growth by segment and geographic region these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods these principal measurements are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states therefore these items represent nonus gaap measures these nonus gaap measures may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 

the company defines “constant currency” sales growth as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding precious metal content and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates this impact is calculated by comparing currentperiod revenues to priorperiod revenues with both periods converted at the us dollar to local currency foreign exchange rate for each month of the prior period for the currencies in which the company does business the company defines “internal sales growth as constant currency sales growth excluding the impacts of precious metals net acquisitions and divestitures and discontinued products 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a portion of dentsply sirona’s net sales comprises of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply sirona reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 



reported net sales of 40292 million increased by 11 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 net sales excluding precious metal content of 39881 million increased by 10 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 net sales excluding precious metal content were impacted by a 33 unfavorable currency impact resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar the divestitures of nonstrategic businesses and discontinued products reduced reported sales growth by 16 on an internal sales growth basis excluding the impact of currency divestitures and discontinued products net sales increased 57 which was attributable to the technologies  equipment segment partially offset by lower consumables revenues 

key drivers of the internal sales growth for the year ended december 31 2019 were strong growth in digital dentistry and positive performance in equipment  instruments and healthcare partially offset by declines in consumables the year ended december 31 2018 included an estimated decrease in inventory within the technologies  equipment segment held at certain distributors of approximately 100 million 

the impact of divestitures of nonstrategic product lines negatively impacted reported net sales by approximately 72 million for the full year of 2019

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including future sales growth operating margin growth benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending business initiatives and working capital changes these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames and trademarks and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow projections a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets 

the fair value of acquired tradenames and trademarks is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation the royalty rate which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including projected revenue royalty rates and appropriate discount rates other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment results 

effective january 1 2019 the company realigned certain businesses between segments resulting in a change from eleven reporting units to five as a result the company transferred goodwill between segments due to these changes affected reporting units including the cadcam and treatment center reporting units in the technologies  equipment segment were tested for potential impairment of goodwill before the transfers the cadcam reporting unit was previously impaired in 2018 and the treatment center reporting unit that the company disclosed in 2018 would not pass a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in the discount rate these reporting units had a fair value that exceeded book value by approximately 10 and 20 respectively at january 1 2019 no goodwill impairment was identified due to the realignment 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill at april 30 2019 on five reporting units to determine the fair value of the company’s reporting units the company uses a discounted cash flow model with marketbased support as its valuation technique to measure the fair value for its reporting units the discounted cash flow model uses fivetotenyear forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on a multiple of earnings or by capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate in the development of the forecasted cash flows the company applies revenue gross profit and operating expense assumptions taking into consideration historical trends as well as futures expectationsthese future expectations include but are not limited to new product development and distribution channel changes for the respective reporting units the company also considers the current and projected market conditions for dental and medical device industries both in the us and globally when determining its assumptions the total forecasted cash flows were discounted based on market participant data which included assumptions regarding the company’s weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows the companys significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow models include but are not limited to the weighted average cost of capital revenue growth rates including perpetual revenue growth rates and gross margin percentages of the reporting units business a change in any of these assumptions could produce a different fair value which could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations no goodwill impairment was identified at april 30 2019 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

during the three months ended march 31 2019 the company impaired 53 million of product tradenames and trademarks within the technologies  equipment segment the impaired indefinitelived intangible assets are tradenames and trademarks held within the equipment and instrument reporting unit the impairment was the result of a change in forecasted sales related to divestitures of nonstrategic product lines 

the company also assessed the annual impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2019 which largely consist of acquired tradenames and trademarks in conjunction with the annual impairment tests of goodwill the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets contain uncertainties and any changes to these assumptions could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment at april 30 2019 the company did not identify any impairment triggers for the indefinitelived intangible assets 

the indefinitelived intangible assets held within the cadcam business were previously impaired in 2018 and the indefinitelived intangible assets held within the imaging business were impaired in the first quarter of 2019 had the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets been hypothetically reduced by 10 or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at april 30 2019 the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value for those assets held within the cadcam business and for the indefinitelived intangible assets held within the imaging business the result would be an insignificant impairment for the company’s indefinitelived assets not discussed above the company also applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis if the fair value of each of these indefinitelived intangibles assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10 or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at april 30 2019 the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges is a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred 

income taxes 

income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes the company’s tax expense includes us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested 

the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely at december 31 2019 the company has a valuation allowance of 2880 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 

the company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing examinations by the tax authorities the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions throughout the world and in the normal course of business is examined by taxing authorities in those jurisdictions adjustments to the uncertain tax positions are recorded when taxing authority examinations are completed statutes of limitation are closed changes in tax laws occur or as new information comes to light with regard to the technical merits of the tax position

off balance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2019 the company held 500 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the financial institutions own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheets these consignment agreements allow the company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time which is approximately the same time and for the same price as alloys are sold to the companys customers in the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements and if the company could not obtain other comparable arrangements the company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels for additional details see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  consignment arrangements of this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the company hedges various currencies primarily in euros swedish kronor canadian dollars british pounds swiss francs japanese yen and australian dollars the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company these cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months and do not change the underlying long term foreign currency exchange risk the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the most significant of which are denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen and swedish kronor the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both derivative and nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment 

at december 31 2019 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would improve the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately 938 million 

interest rate risk management 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company early terminated its existing 2456 million euro cross currency basis swap and entered into a new 2634 million euro cross currency basis swap maturing in august 2021 the cross currency basis swap is designated as a hedge of net investments this contract effectively converts the 2957 million bond coupon from 41 to 12 

at december 31 2019 an increase of 1 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would not have a significant impact on the company’s annual interest expense as the company’s debt portfolio comprises primarily of fixed rate debt at december 31 2019 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancellable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 42000 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 500 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2019 the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 23 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

markets sales and distribution 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dentsply sirona employs approximately 5000 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of its distributors dealers and the endusers 

dental 

dentsply sirona distributes approximately half of its dental consumable and technology products through thirdparty distributors certain highly technical products such as dental technology equipment dental ceramics crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials orthodontic appliances dental implants are often sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets for the year ended december 31 2016  two  customers henry schein inc and patterson companies inc both dental distributors each accounted for more than ten  percent of consolidated net sales at december 31 2016  one  customer patterson companies inc accounted for more than ten  percent of the consolidated accounts receivable balance for the year ended december 31 2015  one  customer henry schein inc accounted for more than ten  percent of consolidated net sales at december 31 2015  there were no customers that accounted for ten  percent or more of the consolidated accounts receivable balance for the year ended december 31 2014  the company had no  single customer that represented ten  percent or more of consolidated net sales 

the company has two exclusive distribution agreements with patterson for the marketing and sales of certain legacy sirona products and equipment in the united states and one similar agreement in canada in order to maintain exclusivity certain purchase targets had to be achieved in the fourth quarter 2016 the decision not to extend the exclusivity beyond september 2017 was announced the company’s relationship with patterson remains strong and the company expects to continue to distribute the products and equipment underlying the agreements through patterson on a nonexclusive basis however the disruption caused by the announcement of the termination of exclusivity as well as a reduction in patterson sales resources negatively impacted fourth quarter sales additionally patterson began to reduce inventories in both the united states and canada which further negatively impacted the company’s reported sales in the fourth quarter by approximately 30 million these factors are expected to continue in 2017 the company is evaluating its options for additional channels of distribution for such products although no firm decisions have been reached as of the date of this filing the company anticipates that the continuation of the inventory reduction could unfavorably impact sales in 2017 by approximately 50 million as patterson reduces inventory in some periods and as other market channels are brought online in other periods notwithstanding the foregoing the company believes enduser demand for its products continues to be strong 

although many of its dental sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply sirona focuses much of its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools which are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and enduser marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field

historical reimbursement levels within europe have been higher for intermittent catheters which explain a greater penetration of singleuse catheter products in that market in the united states which the company considers an important growth market the reimbursement environment has improved since 2008 as the infection control cost benefits of disposable catheters gain acceptance among payers 

the company’s surgery products are sold directly in approximately 13 countries and through distributors in approximately 20 additional markets the company’s largest markets include australia norway and the uk key customers include surgeons hospital nurses physiotherapists hospital purchasing departments and medical supply distributors

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions by entering into licensing agreements with third parties and by purchasing technologies developed by third parties

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the first or fourth quarter price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period sales for the industry and the company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply sirona’s business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

dentsply sirona may be unable to integrate successfully dentsply’s and sirona’s businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the success of the merger will depend in large part on the ability of dentsply sirona to realize the anticipated benefits including revenue and cost synergies from combining dentsply and sirona’s businesses to realize these anticipated benefits dentsply and sirona’s businesses must be successfully integrated this integration will be complex and time consuming the failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in dentsply sirona not fully achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger potential difficulties dentsply sirona may encounter as part of the integration process include but are not limited to the following 

 

in addition given that dentsply and sirona operated independently until the completion of the merger it is possible that the integration process could result in 

 

the future results of dentsply sirona will suffer if dentsply sirona does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger 

the size of the business of the dentsply sirona will increase significantly beyond the size of either dentsply or sirona’s business prior to the merger dentsply sirona’s future success depends in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that dentsply sirona will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

the success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions and dispositions 

with respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses the company may not achieve expected returns and other benefits associated with business combinations as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology in addition the company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities however the company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the company achieve its strategic objectives and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy 

after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may prevent the company from completing the transaction in a timely manner or at all from a workforce perspective risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include among others delays in anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impacts on the company’s relationship with labor unions adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

when the company decides to sell assets or a business the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives alternatively the company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the company had anticipated or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business such as through continuing equity ownership transition service agreements guarantees indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the acquired or divested business or other conditions outside the company’s control could affect its future financial results 

in the context of acquisitions there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy the healthcare industry is subject to changing political regulatory and other influences it has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs these changes include legislative healthcare reform the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers some of these potential changes may cause a decrease in demand for andor reduce the prices of dentsply sirona’s products these changes could adversely affect dentsply sirona’s revenues and profitability in addition similar legislative efforts in the future could adversely impact dentsply sirona’s business 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 the “health care reform law” made major changes to the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payors certain provisions of the health care reform law and rules issued thereunder could affect us adversely by increasing provider costs shrinking the pool of covered persons or restricting coverage of related services the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid one such provision that began in 2013 imposed a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers this adversely affected sales and cost of goods sold through december 31 2015 this provision was temporarily suspended through december 31 2017 which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold thereafter if not repealed the health care reform law may also adversely affect payors by increasing their medical cost trends which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas although the extent of this impact is currently unknown additionally further federal and state proposals for health care reform are likely as a result of the us elections in november 2016 and the health care reform 

law may be invalidated in whole or in part or it may be repealed we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

in certain international markets particularly in european union member countries and other countries whose marketplaces are dominated by governmentadministered healthcare programs government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than in other markets changes to these programs could have a negative impact on the company’s results 

inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other thirdparty payors for procedures using dentsply sirona’s products may cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

thirdparty payors including government health administration authorities private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and costeffectiveness of medical products and services while dentsply sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other thirdparty payors will have on future sales of our products there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause dentsply sirona’s revenue to decline 

negative changes in the dental or medical device markets or prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets in which the company operates may adversely affect the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

notwithstanding that the company believes that its business is less susceptible than many other industries to general economic downturns the success of the company is dependent upon the continued strength of the dental and medical device markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which it operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition in many markets dental reimbursement is largely out of pocket for the consumer and thus utilization rates can vary significantly depending on economic growth for instance data suggests that the utilization of dental services by working age adults in the us may have declined over the last several years prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity the june 2016 uk referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “brexit” and the likely withdrawal of the uk from the european union as a result may create further global economic uncertainty which may cause our current and future customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear how brexit may negatively impact the economies of the uk the european union and other nations however any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our financial position results of operation or cash flows 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply sirona’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the company’s customers’ access to credit as well as on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets although the company may use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company additionally as a result of brexit global markets and foreign currencies may be adversely impacted in particular the value of the british pound has declined as compared to the us dollar and other currencies this volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the uk negotiates and executes its exit from the european union but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur a significantly weaker british pound compared to the us dollar could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further policy changes resulting from the november 2016 us elections could also affect foreign exchange markets 

dentsply sirona hedging and cash management transactions may expose dentsply sirona to loss or limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains 

as part of dentsply sirona’s risk management program we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts while intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations these transactions may limit dentsply sirona’s potential gains or expose dentsply sirona to loss should dentsply sirona’s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these 

transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions 

we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation and although dentsply sirona’s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective as hedges of underlying physical transactions these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by dentsply sirona’s counterparties their failure to perform could result in dentsply sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of dentsply sirona’s exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing dentsply sirona’s exposure to changes in interest rates if such events occur dentsply sirona’s results of operations may be adversely affected 

most of dentsply sirona’s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure dentsply sirona’s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under dentsply sirona’s multicurrency revolving credit facility the failure of any bank in which we deposit dentsply sirona’s funds or that is part of dentsply sirona’s multicurrency revolving credit facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in dentsply sirona’s business 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the company’s ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

although the company continues to have positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the company’s ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the company’s businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that would not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may be volatile 

dentsply sirona experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to

year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply sirona’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply sirona’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas in which the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm the company’s business

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

dentsply sirona’s failure to obtain issued patents and consequently to protect dentsply sirona’s proprietary technology could hurt dentsply sirona’s competitive position 

dentsply sirona’s success will depend in part on dentsply sirona’s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to dentsply sirona’s products technologies and processes both in the united states and in other countries risks and uncertainties that dentsply sirona faces with respect to dentsply sirona’s patents and patent applications include the following 

 

dentsply sirona’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s proprietary technology 

dentsply sirona’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights or misappropriate dentsply sirona’s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses to protect dentsply sirona’s rights to dentsply sirona’s intellectual property dentsply sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with dentsply sirona’s employees strategic partners and others dentsply sirona cannot assure you that any of dentsply sirona’s patents any of the patents of which dentsply sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to dentsply sirona or which we may license in the future will provide dentsply sirona with a competitive advantage or afford dentsply sirona protection against infringement by others or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties including dentsply sirona’s competitors the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of dentsply sirona’s proprietary information dentsply sirona may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights effective patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which dentsply sirona will offer or intend to offer dentsply sirona’s products any failure to adequately protect dentsply sirona’s intellectual property could devalue dentsply sirona’s proprietary content and impair dentsply sirona’s ability to compete effectively further defending dentsply sirona’s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 

dentsply sirona’s profitability may suffer if dentsply sirona’s products are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others 

litigation may be necessary to enforce dentsply sirona’s patents or to defend against any claims of infringement of patents owned by third parties that are asserted against dentsply sirona in addition dentsply sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign patent governing authorities to determine the priority of inventions which could result in substantial costs 

if dentsply sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings dentsply sirona may incur substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the attention of dentsply sirona’s technical and management personnel even if dentsply sirona ultimately prevails an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities allow dentsply sirona’s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from dentsply sirona prohibit dentsply sirona from marketing dentsply sirona’s products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all if dentsply sirona cannot obtain such licenses dentsply sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing dentsply sirona’s products 

the enforcement defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights including the united states patent and trademark office’s the european patent office’s and other foreign patent offices’ interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions as a result these proceedings are costly and timeconsuming and their outcome is uncertain litigation may be necessary to 

 

due to the international nature of our business including increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

approximately twothirds of the company’s sales are located in regions outside the united states in addition we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply sirona’s revenue operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

certain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates for example as a result of brexit or the results of the november 2016 us elections both of which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffsregulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees

a large number of the company’s products are manufactured in single manufacturing facilities 

although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any cyberattacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

dentsply sirona operates many aspects of its business including financial reporting and customer relationship management through server and webbased technologies and stores various types of data on such servers or with thirdparties who may in turn store it on servers or in the “cloud” any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” cyberattacks and other attempts to penetrate 

networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruptions and the company may be the victim of cyberattacks targeted at the theft of financial assets intellectual property personal information of individuals and customers or other sensitive information in some cases it is difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby these data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyberattacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources these incidents could also subject us to liability expose us to significant expense or cause significant harm to our reputation which could result in lost revenues while dentsply sirona has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from cyberattacks technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsply sirona’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply sirona’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply sirona’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsply sirona’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered 

dentsply sirona has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsply sirona’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

the company has debt securities outstanding of approximately 15 billion dentsply sirona also has the ability to incur up to 5000 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsply sirona’s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

dentsply sirona’s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios which the company is required to satisfy under the note purchase agreement dated december 11 2015 the company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 06 to 10 and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times all of the company’s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios though no assurance can be given that dentsply sirona will be able to do so dentsply sirona’s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

we utilize the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including our access to the unsecured borrowing market we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents and of delaware law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply sirona 

certain provisions of dentsply sirona’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply sirona such provisions include among others a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsply sirona’s bylaws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsply sirona’s management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 2 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply sirona delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock 

the company’s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event 

the company operates in more than 120 countries and its and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the company’s business and consolidated results of operations any insurance maintained by the company may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions and our emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future 

dentsply sirona is dependent upon a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of dentsply sirona’s revenue and loss of these key distributors could result in a loss of a significant amount of dentsply sirona’s revenue 

historically a substantial portion of dentsply sirona’s revenue has come from a limited number of distributors for example patterson companies inc and henry schein inc each accounted for approximately 12 of the annual revenue of dentsply sirona in 2016 it is anticipated that patterson companies inc and henry schein inc will continue to be the largest contributors to dentsply sirona’s revenue for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that patterson companies inc and henry schein inc will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from dentsply sirona or that they will continue to purchase any products at all if patterson companies inc or henry schein inc ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from dentsply sirona it could have a material adverse effect on dentsply sirona’s results of operations and financial condition this risk is increased by the fact that exclusive arrangement the company has with patterson companies inc with respect to certain products in the us and canada will terminate subsequent to september 2017 we cannot assure you that this cessation of exclusivity will not adversely affect our results of operations as we transition from a single distributor model to a multidistributor model for our cerec cadcam products our sales could be adversely affected as we incorporate new distributors into our network 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce dentsply sirona’s products which could result in decreased sales or increased costs either of which would negatively impact dentsply sirona’s financial condition and results of operations 

a significant part of our foreign employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements and some of dentsply sirona’s employees are unionized therefore dentsply sirona is subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of dentsply sirona’s principal facilities could have a negative impact on dentsply sirona’s business financial condition or results of operations 

dentsply sirona has developed and must continue to maintain internal controls 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide assurance with respect to dentsply sirona’s financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud if dentsply sirona cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to dentsply sirona’s financial 

reports and effectively prevent fraud dentsply sirona’s operating results could be harmed the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires dentsply sirona to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including managements’ assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its certain limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud as a result even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if dentsply sirona fails to maintain adequate internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if dentsply sirona experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls dentsply sirona’s business and operating results could be harmed and dentsply sirona could fail to meet dentsply sirona’s reporting obligations 

dentsply sirona is subject to paymentsrelated risks 

dentsply sirona accepts payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options dentsply sirona offers to dentsply sirona’s customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards dentsply sirona pays interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise dentsply sirona’s operating costs and lower profitability dentsply sirona relies on third parties to provide certain payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt dentsply sirona’s business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to dentsply sirona we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if dentsply sirona fails to comply with these rules or requirements or if dentsply sirona’s data security systems are breached or compromised dentsply sirona may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose dentsply sirona’s ability to accept credit and debit card payments from dentsply sirona’s customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and dentsply sirona’s business and operating results could be adversely affected

business 

the company operates in two business segments dental and healthcare consumables   and technologies  

the dental and healthcare consumables  segment includes responsibility for the worldwide design manufacture sales and distribution of the company’s dental and healthcare consumable products which include preventive restorative instruments endodontic and laboratory dental products as well as consumable medical device products 

the technologies  segment is responsible for the worldwide design manufacture sales and distribution of the company’s dental technology products which includes dental implants cadcam systems imaging systems treatment centers and orthodontic products 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 constant currency sales growth by segment and geographic region 2 internal sales growth by segment and geographic region and 3 adjusted operating income and margins of each reportable segment which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting corporate expenses and certain other items to enhance the comparability of results period to period these principal measurements are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states therefore these items represent nonus gaap measures these nonus gaap measures may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 

the company defines “constant currency” sales growth as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding precious metal content and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates this impact is calculated by comparing currentperiod revenues to priorperiod revenues with both periods converted at the us dollar to local currency average foreign exchange rate for each month of the prior period for the currencies in which the company does business the company defines “internal” sales growth as constant currency sales growth excluding the impacts of net acquisitions and divestitures merger accounting impacts and discontinued products 

business drivers 

the primary drivers of internal growth include macroeconomic factors global dental market growth innovation and new product launches by the company as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources including clinical education management believes that the company’s ability to execute its strategies has allowed it to grow faster than the underlying dental market 

the company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis the company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency in addition management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations and functions as part of integration activities to further reduce costs the company believes that the benefits from these global efficiency and integration initiatives will improve the cost structure and help mitigate the impacts of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance 

the company expects that it will record restructuring charges from time to time associated with such initiatives these restructuring charges could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements and there can be no assurance that the target adjusted operating income margins will continue to be achieved 

in october 2016 the company announced that it is proposing plans in germany to reorganize and combine portions of its manufacturing logistics and distribution networks within both of the company’s segments as required under german law the company has entered into a statutory codetermination process under which it will collaborate with the appropriate labor groups to jointly define the infrastructure and staffing adjustments necessary to support this initiative the company also initiated similar actions in other regions of the world the company estimates the cost of these initiatives to range up to 83 million primarily for severance related benefits for employees which is expected to be incurred as actions are implemented over the next two years 

product innovation is a key component of the company’s overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in the dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental  healthcare consumable and dental technology products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income price increases promotional activities as well as distributor inventory management contribute to this fluctuation the company typically implements most of its price increases in october or january of a given year across most of its businesses distributor inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase required minimum purchase commitments under agreements with key distributors may increase inventory levels at those distributors to the extent that future purchase commitments may not be met and could impact the company’s consolidated net sales and net income in a given period or over multiple periods in addition the company may from time to time engage in new distributor relationships that could cause quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income any of these fluctuations could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings technologies and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships and acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates have experienced consolidation they remain fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

the company has two exclusive distribution agreements with patterson for the marketing and sales of certain legacy sirona products and equipment in the united states and and one similar agreement in canada in order to maintain exclusivity certain purchase targets had to be achieved in the fourth quarter 2016 the decision not to extend the exclusivity beyond september 2017 was announced the company’s relationship with patterson remains strong and the company expects to continue to distribute the products and equipment underlying the agreements through patterson on a nonexclusive basis however the disruption caused by the announcement of the termination of exclusivity as well as a reduction in patterson sales resources negatively impacted fourth quarter sales additionally patterson began to reduce inventories in both the united states and canada which further negatively impacted the company’s reported sales in the fourth quarter by approximately 30 million these factors are expected to continue in 2017 the company is evaluating its options for additional channels of distribution for such products although no firm decisions have been reached as of the date of this filing the company anticipates that the continuation of the inventory reduction could unfavorably impact sales in 2017 by approximately 50 million as patterson reduces inventory in some periods and as other market channels are brought online in other periods notwithstanding the foregoing the company believes enduser demand for its products continues to be strong 

impact of foreign currencies and interest rates 

due to the company’s significant international presence movements in foreign exchange and interest rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately two thirds of the company’s net sales located in regions outside the united states the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange and interest rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity for the year ended december 31 2016  net sales excluding precious metal content were unfavorably impacted by approximately 12 and earnings per diluted common share by approximately 008 due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior years’ data in order to conform to current year presentation specifically during the march 31 2016 quarter the company realigned reporting responsibilities as a result of the merger and changed the management structure the segment information reflects the revised structure for all periods shown 

results of operations 

2016 compared to 2015 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth which excludes precious metal content into the following components 1 impact of the merger and 2 the results of the “combined businesses” as if the businesses were merged on january 1 2015 these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a portion of dentsply sirona’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply sirona reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 



net sales excluding precious metal content for the year ended december 31 2016 were 36810 million an increase of 10995 million from the year ended december 31 2015 as reported by legacy dentsply this excludes approximately 135 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income 

sales related to precious metal content declined 307 during 2016 which was primarily related to the discontinued refinery product lines and to a lesser extent the continued reduction in the use of precious metal alloys in dentistry 

for the year ended december 31 2016 sales of our combined businesses grew 36 on a constant currency basis this includes a benefit of 17 from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 50 basis points which leads to internal growth of 24 net sales excluding precious metal content were negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the strengthening of the us dollar over the prior year period a reconciliation of reported net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content of the combined business for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectfully is as follows 



a represents sirona sales for january and february 2016 and the year ended december 31 2015 

b represents an adjustment to reflect deferred subscription and warranty revenue that was eliminated under business combination accounting standards to make the 2016 and 2015 nonus gaap combined business results comparable

gross profit 



gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content decreased by 440 basis points for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 this decrease was the result of the rolloff of merger related fair value adjustments sirona’s lower gross profit rate and foreign currency which negatively impacted the rate by 610 basis points the decrease was partially offset by savings from the company’s global efficiency and integration program and favorable product pricing during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015

sga expenses 

sga expenses including research and developing expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased 30 basis points compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease was primarily the result of sirona’s lower operating expense rate and savings from the company’s global efficiency and integration program partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions   

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount 

rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including future sales growth operating margin growth benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending business initiatives and working capital changes these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

the performance of the companys 2016  annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the companys goodwill the wacc rates utilized in the 2016  analysis ranged from 67 to 147 had the wacc rate of each of the companys reporting units been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at april 30 2016  the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of each of the companys reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5 at april 30 2016  the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of each of the companys reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at april 30 2016  one reporting unit within the company’s technologies  segment would have a fair value that would approximate net book value goodwill for that reporting unit totals 660 million at april 30 2016  to the extent that future operating results of the reporting units do not meet the forecasted cash flow projections the company can provide no assurance that a future goodwill impairment charge would not be incurred 

at december 31 2016  the company updated its goodwill impairment testing for the one reporting unit noted above based on current year financial performance the review did not result in any impairment of the reporting units’ goodwill balance assumptions used in the calculations of fair value were substantially consistent with those at april 30 2016  had the wacc rate of this reporting unit had been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at december 31 2016  the fair value of this reporting unit would still exceed net book value if the fair value of this reporting unit had been hypothetically reduced by 5 the fair value of would still exceed book value if the fair value of the reporting unit had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at december 31 2016  the reporting unit fair value would approximate net book value at december 31 2016  the goodwill balance for this reporting unit was 547 million additionally three reporting units all components of the technologies operating segment and one reporting unit a component of the dental and healthcare consumables  operating segment were created as a result of the sirona merger on february 29 2016  at the date of the merger the fair value of the businesses equaled book value with goodwill for the reporting units totaling 37768 million  given the limited time since the merger date the reporting units’ fair values approximate the book values of the reporting units slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flow projections among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill may not be recoverable 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow projections a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets 

the fair value of acquired tradenames is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including projected revenue royalty rates and appropriate discount rates royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

the performance of the company’s 2016  annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the company’s indefinitelived assets except for the indefinitelived intangibles noted below if the fair value of each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10 or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at december 31 2016  the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value additionally indefinitelived assets recorded on three reporting units all within the technologies operating segment and indefinitelived assets recorded on one reporting unit within the dental and healthcare consumables  operating segment were identified and fair valued as result of the sirona merger on february 29 2016  at the date of the merger the fair value of the indefinitelived assets equaled book value totaling 9050 million given the limited time since the merger date the indefinitelived asset’s fair values approximate the book values slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flow projections among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the company’s indefinitelived assets may not be recoverable 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the use of the tradenames it could result in impairment of the carrying value of the indefinitelived assets to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future indefinitelived asset impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges is a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred

the company’s revolving credit facility term loans and senior notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the companys operations and financial condition these credit agreements contain a number of covenants and two financial ratios which the company is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of total debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 06 to 10 and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times any breach of any such covenants or ratios would result in a default under the existing debt agreements that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle the companys other lenders to accelerate their loans at december 31 2016 the company was in compliance with these covenants

off balance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2016 the company held 344 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheet these consignment agreements allow the company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time which is approximately the same time and for the same price as alloys are sold to the companys customers in the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements and if the company could not obtain other comparable arrangements the company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents the companys scheduled contractual cash obligations at december 31 2016  



due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2016 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 137 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 14 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company these cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months 

and do not change the underlying long term foreign currency exchange risk the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment 

at december 31 2016  a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would improve the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately 159 million 

interest rate risk management 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt and in the past to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2016 the company has one significant interest rate swap this interest rate swap has notional amounts totaling 126 billion japanese yen and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed interest rate of 09 for a term of five years ending in september 2019 the interest rates on variable rate term loan debt are consistent with current market conditions therefore the fair value of this instrument approximates its carrying values 

at december 31 2016  an increase of 10 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would increase the company’s annual interest expense by approximately 16 million 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2016  the company had approximately 44100 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 344 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2016  the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 06 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

markets sales and distribution 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for its dental and medical products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsply’s dental and medical products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

developed markets 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental and health products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 80 to 85 of the company’s net sales in these markets dental care is increasingly focused upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as excavation of teeth and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination a broader segment of the population in these markets can afford higher end treatments in both dental and medical care 

emerging markets 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to excavation of teeth and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 15 to 20 of the company’s net sales the company markets products with a diverse price range including dualbrand alternatives to address patient and professional needs however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive a level of dental and medical care similar to that received in developed countries as such many of our premium products are actively sold into these regions 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality innovative products clinical education technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to benefit from opportunities in virtually any market 

dentsply employs approximately 3600 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of its distributors dealers and the endusers 

dental 

dentsply distributes approximately half of its dental products through thirdparty distributors certain highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys dental ceramics crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials orthodontic appliances implants and bone substitute and grafting materials are often sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets in 2015 one customer henry schein incorporated a dental distributor accounted for 11 of dentsply’s consolidated net sales no other single customer represented ten percent or more of dentsply’s consolidated net sales during 2015 during 2014 and 2013 the company did not have a single customer that represented ten percent or more of dentsply’s consolidated net sales 

although many of its dental sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools which are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and enduser marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field 

medical 

the company’s urology products are sold directly in approximately 15 countries throughout europe and north america and through distributors in approximately 20 additional markets the company’s largest markets include the uk germany and france key customers include urologists urology nurses general practitioners and directtopatients 

historical reimbursement levels within europe have been higher for intermittent catheters which explain a greater penetration of singleuse catheter products in that market in the us which the company considers an important growth market the reimbursement environment has improved since 2008 as the infection control cost benefits of disposable catheters gain acceptance among payers 

the company’s surgery products are sold directly in approximately 13 countries and through distributors in approximately 20 additional markets the company’s largest markets include australia norway and the uk key customers include surgeons hospital nurses physiotherapists hospital purchasing departments and medical supply distributors 

the company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various medical associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in this field 

product development 

innovation and successful product development are critical to keeping market leadership position in key product categories and growing market share in other products categories while strengthening the company’s prominence in the dental and medical markets that it serves while many of dentsply’s existing products undergo brand extensions the company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that represent fundamental change 

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and in select areas of healthcare as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools the company directly invested 749 million 808 million and 851 million in 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the yearoveryear investment for all years was reduced by foreign currency translation which increased reported expense variations the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the company’s strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry and in select areas in health care 

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions by entering into licensing agreements with third parties and by purchasing technologies developed by third parties

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use of amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway in the united states the environmental protection agency proposed in september 2014 certain effluent limitation guidelines and standards under the clean water act to help cut discharges of mercurycontaining dental amalgam to the environment the rule would require affected dentists to use best available technology amalgam separators and other best management practices to control mercury discharges to publiclyowned treatment works the company strongly recommends adherence to the american dental association’s best management practices for amalgam waste and includes this in every package of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply’s business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

the proposed business combination transaction between the company and sirona dental systems inc may present certain risks to the companys business and operations 

on september 15 2015 the company and sirona dental systems inc “sirona” entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” providing for a “merger of equals” business combination transaction pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement which was approved by the boards of directors of the company and sirona at the closing of the transaction each outstanding share of sirona common stock will be converted into the right to receive 18142 shares of company common stock on january 11 2016 the respective stockholders of the company and sirona approved the proposed transaction the company expects the transaction which remains subject to certain regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions contained in the merger agreement to close in the first quarter of 2016 

risks related to the merger 

the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from foreign regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on dentsply or the combined company or if not obtained could prevent completion of the merger 

before the merger may be completed applicable waiting periods must expire or terminate under antitrust and competition laws in deciding whether to grant regulatory clearances the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction the terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business the merger agreement may require the company andor sirona to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities and in certain circumstances either company may refuse to close the merger on the basis of those regulatory conditions there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions and that such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger in addition neither dentsply nor sirona can provide assurance that any such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger 

any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder 

in addition to the required regulatory clearances the merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond the company’s and sirona’s control that may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion dentsply cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied furthermore the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize or to be delayed in realizing some or all of the synergies that the company expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame 

uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company 

the company and sirona are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers and other key employees to execute their business plans dentsply and sirona’s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the merger which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of the company and sirona to attract or retain key management and other key personnel accordingly no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of the company and sirona to the same extent that the company and sirona have previously been able to attract or retain employees a failure by the company sirona or following the completion of the merger the combined company to attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the period prior to or after the completion of the merger could have a negative impact on their respective businesses 

lawsuits have been filed against each of the company and sirona’s board of directors challenging the merger and an adverse ruling may prevent the merger from being completed 

the company merger sub and the members of sirona’s board of directors were named as defendants in lawsuits brought by sirona stockholders challenging the merger and seeking among other things injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from 

completing the merger on the agreedupon terms additional lawsuits may be filed against the company merger sub sirona andor their respective directors or officers in connection with the merger 

one of the conditions to the closing of the merger is the absence of any order injunction decree statute rule or regulation by a court or other governmental entity that makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement consequently if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties’ ability to complete the merger then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of dentsply and sirona 

completion of the merger is not assured and is subject to risks including the risks that approval by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied if the merger is not completed the ongoing businesses and financial results of the company andor sirona may be adversely affected and dentsply andor sirona will be subject to several risks including the following 

 

if the merger is not completed dentsply and sirona cannot assure their respective stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect the business financial results and stock prices of dentsply or sirona 

the merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either the company or sirona 

the merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that subject to limited exceptions restrict each of dentsply and sirona’s ability to solicit initiate or knowingly encourage and induce or take any other action designed to facilitate competing thirdparty proposals relating to a merger reorganization or consolidation of the company or an acquisition of the company’s stock or assets 

these provisions could discourage a potential thirdparty acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the company or sirona from considering or proposing that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger or might result in a potential thirdparty acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to the stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the 280 million or 205 million termination fee as applicable that may become payable in certain circumstances 

if the merger agreement is terminated and either the company or sirona determines to seek another business combination it may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to or better than the terms of the merger 

the company and sirona’s executive officers and directors have certain interests in the merger that may be different from or in addition to the interests of dentsply and sirona stockholders generally 

dentsply’s and sirona’s executive officers and directors have certain interests in the merger that may be different from or in addition to the interests of dentsply stockholders and sirona stockholders generally dentsply’s executive officers and sirona’s executive officers negotiated the terms of the merger agreement the executive officers of dentsply and sirona have arrangements with dentsply or sirona as applicable that provide for severance benefits if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances following the completion of the merger in addition certain of sirona’s compensation and benefit plans and arrangements provide for payment or accelerated vesting or distribution of certain rights or benefits upon completion 

of the merger under the merger agreement dentsply and sirona may act before completion of the merger to accelerate the vesting of equity awards restricted stock units and in the case of dentsply also stock options held by some or all of its nonemployee directors who will not continue as directors of the combined company after the merger executive officers and directors also have rights to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that will survive completion of the merger 

upon completion of the merger the board of directors of the combined company will be comprised of eleven members consisting of six of dentsply’s current directors and five of sirona’s current directors mr jeffery t slovin currently a director and the president and chief executive officer of sirona will serve as a director and as chief executive officer of the combined company and mr wise dentsply’s current chairman and chief executive officer will serve as executive chairman of the board of directors of the combined company additionally the combined company’s management team will include executives from each of dentsply and sirona from dentsply christopher t clark the current president and chief financial officer of dentsply will serve as president and chief operating officer technologies of the combined company and james g mosch the current executive vice president and chief operating officer of dentsply will serve as president and chief operating officer dental and healthcare consumables of the combined company from sirona ulrich michel the current executive vice president and chief financial officer of sirona will serve as executive vice president and chief financial officer of the combined company 

each of dentsply’s and sirona’s boards of directors were aware of these interests at the time each approved the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement these interests including the continued employment of certain of dentsply’s and sirona’s executive officers by the combined company the continued positions of certain of dentsply’s and sirona’s directors as directors of the combined company and the indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company may cause dentsply’s and sirona’s directors and executive officers to view the merger proposal differently and more favorably than stockholders generally 

current holders of dentsply’s and sirona’s common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management 

current holders of dentsply and sirona common stock have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting dentsply and sirona respectively upon the completion of the merger each of sirona’s stockholders who receives shares of dentsply common stock will become a stockholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than such stockholder’s percentage ownership of sirona similarly after completion of the merger the shares of combined company common stock retained by each dentsply stockholder will represent a smaller percentage ownership of the combined company it is currently expected that sirona’s stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 42 of the shares of combined company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the merger as a result stockholders of dentsply immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as a group will own approximately 58 of the shares of combined company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the merger because of this dentsply and sirona stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of dentsply and sirona respectively 

risks related to the combined company following the merger 

the combined company may be unable to integrate successfully dentsply’s and sirona’s businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the success of the merger will depend in large part on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits including cost savings from combining dentsply and sirona’s businesses to realize these anticipated benefits dentsply and sirona’s businesses must be successfully integrated this integration will be complex and time consuming the failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not fully achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger potential difficulties the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process include but are not limited to the following 

 13 

 

in addition dentsply and sirona have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in 

 

the merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the combined company’s adjusted earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of the combined company’s common stock 

dentsply and sirona currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to stockholders on an adjusted earnings per share basis within the first full year following the completion of the merger this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change the combined company could also encounter additional transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger all of these factors could cause dilution to the combined company’s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market value of the combined company’s common stock 

the future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger 

following the merger the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either dentsply or sirona’s business the combined company’s future success depends in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration of dentsply and sirona 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of dentsply and sirona there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management manufacturing research and development marketing and benefits while dentsply and sirona have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred there are many factors beyond each company’s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the merger and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

these risks as they relate to the company as part of the combined company and additional risks associated with the merger are described in more detail under the heading “risk factors” in the company’s registration statement on form s4 file no 333207669 filed with the sec 

negative changes could occur in the dental or medical device markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental and medical device markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which dentsply operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition in many markets dental reimbursement is largely out of pocket for the consumer and thus utilization rates can vary significantly depending on economic growth for instance data suggests that the utilization of dental services by working age adults in the us may have declined over the last several years additionally there is also uncertainty as to what impact the affordable care act may have on dental utilization in the us in certain markets particularly in the european union government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than in other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the company’s results 

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the company’s suppliers and customers and consumers which could harm the company’s financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the company’s customers’ access to credit as well as on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets although the company may use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the company’s ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

although the company continues to have positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the company’s ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the company’s businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that would not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may be volatile 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to 

 15 

 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas in which the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm the company’s business 

the dental and medical device supplies markets are highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

the worldwide markets for dental and medical products are highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the company’s products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsply’s competitors may have greater resources than the company in addition the company is exposed to the risk that its competitors or its customers may introduce private label generic or low cost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points if these competitors’ products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

the market for dentsply’s products is characterized by rapid and significant technological change new intellectual property associated with that technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions additionally dentsply’s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life there can be no assurance that dentsply’s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the company’s investment in product development if the company’s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete dentsply’s business could be negatively affected 

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable us or international government or regulatory authorities or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the company’s products obsolete 

dentsply’s business is subject to extensive complex and changing laws regulations and orders that failure to comply with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws regulations and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws regulations and orders there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws regulations and orders failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 the company received subpoenas from the united states attorney’s office for the southern district of indiana the “usao” and from ofac requesting documents and information related to compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain of its subsidiaries the company also voluntarily contacted ofac and bis regarding compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain other business units of the company identified in an ongoing internal review by the company the company is cooperating with the usao ofac and bis with respect to these matters 

the company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs the company may announce from time to time restructuring plans including workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings the company has targeted adjusted operating income margins of at least 20 as the benefits of these initiatives net of related investments are realized over time due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities and the quarterly phasing of related investments the company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits and its operations and business could be disrupted company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions and implementation may require the agreement of the company’s labor unions risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impact on the company’s relationship with labor unions adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products certain dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors dentsply may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the company’s ability to deliver products to customers if the company is unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner or if the company encounters delays or other difficulties in the supply or manufacturing of such products and other materials internally or from third parties the company’s business and results of operations may be harmed 

dentsply may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances

inventories maintained by the company’s customers may fluctuate from time to time 

the company relies in part on its predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results these inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

the company is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions unanticipated changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results of operations the company’s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by factors such as changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company does business by structural changes in the company’s businesses by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates or by changes in the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

challenges may be asserted against the company’s products due to real or perceived quality or health issues 

the company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products while the company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality or health impact of the company’s products or certain raw material components of the company’s products all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenola commonly called bpa bpa is found in many everyday items such as plastic bottles foods detergents and toys and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a byproduct of other ingredients that have degraded or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants the fda 

currently allows the use of bpa in dental materials medical devices and food packaging nevertheless public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of bpa could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the company’s products that contain mercury or bpa adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products whether or not ultimately based on fact may have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and operating results 

issues related to the quality and safety of the company’s products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall or discontinuation resulting in harm to the company’s reputation and negatively impacting the company’s operating results 

the company’s products generally maintain a good reputation with customers and endusers issues related to quality and safety of products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize the company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for the company’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions the company may need to recall or discontinue products if they become unfit for use in addition the company could potentially be subject to litigation or government action which could result in payment of fines or damages cost associated with these potential actions could negatively affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the company’s orthodontics business is subject to risk 

the company sources a substantial portion of its orthodontic products from a japanese supplier under an agreement that is subject to periodic renewal the company also has established alternative sources of supply the market for orthodontic products is highly competitive and subject to significant negative price pressure 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable charges to operations 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures it is possible that future accounting standards the company would be required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment applied to the company’s consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

if the company’s goodwill or intangible assets become impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap the company reviews its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill or intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates net sales growth discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows are critical assumptions used to determine these fair values slower net sales growth rates in the dental or medical device industries an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flows among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets is determined 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third 

party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe 

we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply’s revenue operating in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees 

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the company’s products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the company’s products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

a large number of the company’s products are manufactured in single manufacturing facilities 

although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

dentsply operates many aspects of its business including financial reporting and customer relationship management through server and webbased technologies and stores various types of data on such servers or with thirdparties who may in turn store it on servers or in the “cloud” any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations while dentsply has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsply’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsply’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered 

dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsply’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

the company has debt securities outstanding of approximately 12 billion dentsply also has the ability to incur up to 500 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsply’s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

dentsply’s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios which the company is required to satisfy under the note purchase agreement dated december 11 2015 the company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 06 to 10 and operating income less depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 30 times all of the company’s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios though no assurance can be given that dentsply will be able to do so dentsply’s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

we utilize the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including our access to the unsecured borrowing market we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents and of delaware law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply 

certain provisions of dentsply’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include among others a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsply’s bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsply’s management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock 

the company’s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event 

the company operates in more than 120  countries and its and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the company’s business and consolidated results of operations any insurance maintained by the company may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions and our emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future

2015  operational highlights 

 

 

 

 

business 

dentsply international inc is a leading manufacturer and distributor of dental and other consumable medical device products the company believes it is the world’s largest manufacturer of consumable dental products for the professional dental market for over a century dentsply’s commitment to innovation and professional collaboration has enhanced its portfolio of branded consumables and small equipment headquartered in the united states the company has global operations with sales in more than 120 countries 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal sales growth by geographic region 2 constant currency sales growth by geographic region 3 adjusted operating margins of each reportable segment which 

excludes the impact of certain one time items to enhance the comparability of results period to period 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products and 5 sales growth through acquisition the first three principal measurements are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states therefore these items represent nonus gaap “nonus gaap” measures these nonus gaap measures may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 

the company defines “internal sales growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 net acquisition sales growth the company also tracks internal sales growth of continuing product lines as this is more reflective of the ongoing strength of the company’s performance the company defines “net acquisition sales growth” as the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months following the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired less the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months prior to the transaction date of businesses that have been divested the company defines “constant currency sales growth” as internal sales growth plus net acquisition sales growth 

the primary drivers of internal growth includes macroeconomic factors global dental market growth innovation and new products launched by the company and continued investments in sales and marketing resources including clinical education management believes that the company’s ability to execute its strategies allows it over time to grow at a modest premium to the growth rate of the underlying dental market management further believes that the global dental market has generally in the past and should over time in the future grow at a premium to underlying economic growth rates considering all of these factors the company assumes that the longterm growth rate for the dental market will range from 3 to 6 on average and that the company targets a slight premium to market growth over the past several years growth in the global dental and other healthcare markets have been restrained by lower economic growth in western europe and certain other markets compared to historical averages and accordingly market growth rates and the company’s internal growth rate remains uncertain in the near term 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes at the beginning of the first or fourth quarters price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period 

the company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis the company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency in addition management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions to reduce costs the company believes that the benefits from these global efficiency initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance during 2014 in connection with these efforts the company targeted adjusted operating income margins to expand to at least 20 net of reinvestments to support the global efficiency effort and to accelerate growth at december 31 2015 the company achieved this target while going forward the company expects to continue operating at or above this target level as the benefits of current initiatives are realized over time and new initiatives are implemented operating margin in any period may be impacted by a number of factors including macroeconomic trends business performance currency rates and the rate of reinvestment in addition efforts associated with the global efficiency initiative may be impacted by the proposed merger with sirona as management shifts focus to the integration process 

the company expects that it will record restructuring charges from time to time associated with such initiatives these restructuring charges could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements and there can be no assurance that the target adjusted operating income margins will continue to be achieved during 2015 consistent with these efforts the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the dental consumables endodontics and dental laboratory businesses segment the realignment of the laboratory business is designed to increase emphasis on innovative prosthetics materials while exiting portions of the laboratory equipment and fabrication businesses 

product innovation is a key component of the company’s overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in the dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental and consumable medical device products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings through acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates have experienced consolidation 

they remain fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

impact of foreign currencies and interest rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange and interest rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately two thirds of the company’s net sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar this impact was significant in 2015 compared to 2014 due in part to a dramatic weakening of the euro in the latter half of 2014 and throughout 2015 additionally movements in certain foreign exchange and interest rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior year’s data in order to conform to current year presentation specifically during the first quarter of 2015 the company realigned reporting responsibilities for multiple locations as a result of changes to the management reporting structure 

results of operations 

2015  compared to 2014 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency sales growth which includes internal sales growth and net acquisition sales growth and 2 foreign currency translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 



for the year ended december 31 2015 net sales excluding precious metal content decreased 2112 million or 76 from the year end december 31 2014 the change in net sales excluding precious metals content reflects 95 unfavorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation and excluding precious metal content net sales grew 19 sales related to precious metal content declined 286 from the prior year period which was primarily due to the continuing reduction in refinery volumes and the declining use of precious metal alloys in dentistry 

constant currency sales growth 

the following table includes growth rates for net sales excluding precious metal content 



united states 

during 2015 net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 26 on a constant currency basis compared to 2014 internal sales growth of 31 was led by increased sales in the dental consumables and dental specialty product categories internal growth for the year ended december 31 2015 was negatively impacted by approximately 08 as a result of product line discontinuations associated with the company’s global efficiency initiative 

europe 

during 2015 net sales excluding precious metal content decreased by 03 on a constant currency basis compared to 2014 internal sales growth was negative 03 mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of dental laboratory products and continued contraction in the cis region partially offset by positive sales growth in dental consumable and dental specialty products categories internal growth for the year ended december 31 2015 was negatively impacted by approximately 05 as a result of product line discontinuations associated with the company’s global efficiency initiative 

rest of world 

during 2015 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 53 on a constant currency basis compared to 2014 the internal sales growth of 49 was led by the dental specialty product category internal growth for the year ended december 31 2015 was negatively impacted by approximately 03 as a result of product line discontinuations associated with the company’s global efficiency initiative 

gross profit 



gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content increased 150 basis points during 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in the gross profit rate was due to the favorable impact of foreign currency benefits from the company’s global efficiency initiative favorable pricing and product mix when compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content increased 80 basis points as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in professional fees mostly related to the company’s global efficiency initiative merger and acquisition related expenses and higher pension costs

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and 

accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions   

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including future sales growth operating margin growth benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending business initiatives and working capital changes these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

the performance of the company’s 2015  annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the company’s goodwill the wacc rates utilized in the 2015  analysis ranged from 76 to 125 had the wacc rate of each of the company’s reporting units been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at april 30 2015  the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5 at april 30 2015  the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of each of the companys reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at april 30 2015 three reporting units one reporting unit within each of the company’s three segments would have a fair value that would approximate net book value goodwill for the reporting unit within the healthcare orthodontic and implant businesses  segment totaled 660 million at april 30 2015 goodwill for the reporting unit within the dental consumables endodontic and dental laboratory businesses  segment totaled 1200 million at april 30 2015 goodwill for the reporting unit within the select developed and emerging markets businesses  segment totaled 160 million at april 30 2015 to the extent that future operating results of the reporting units do not meet the forecasted cash flows the company can provide no assurance that a future goodwill impairment charge would not be incurred 

at december 31 2015 the company updated its goodwill impairment testing for the three reporting units noted above based on current year financial performance the review did not result in any impairment of the three reporting units’ respective goodwill balances assumptions used in the calculations of fair value were substantially consistent with those at april 30 2015 if the wacc rate of these three reporting units had been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at december 31 2015 the fair value of these three reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5 the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed book value if the fair value of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at december 31 2015 the three reporting units fair value would approximate net book value at december 31 2015 the goodwill balances for the three reporting units were approximately the same as at april 30 2015 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets 

the fair value of acquired tradenames is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including projected revenue royalty rates and appropriate discount rates royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

the performance of the company’s 2015  annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the company’s indefinitelived assets if the fair value of each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10 or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at december 31 2015  the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the use of the tradenames it could result in impairment of the carrying value of the indefinitelived assets to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future indefinitelived asset impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges are a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred

the following table presents the companys scheduled contractual cash obligations at december 31 2015  



due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 185 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 14  income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

the company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance cash requirements including capital expenditures in a range of 800 million to 1000 million excluding the impact of the potential merger stock repurchases debt service operating leases and potential future acquisitions from the current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities which is further discussed in note 12  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements the company intends to pay or refinance the current portion of long term debt due in 2016 utilizing proceeds from the private placement notes arranged in december 2015 with delayed draw funding as noted in the companys consolidated statements of cash flows in this form 10k the company continues to generate strong cash flows from operations which is used to finance the companys activities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company these cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months and do not change the underlying long term foreign currency exchange risk the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment 

at december 31 2015  a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would improve the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately 771 million 

interest rate risk management 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt and to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2015 the company has three groups of significant interest rate swaps one of the groups of swaps has notional amounts totaling 126 billion japanese yen and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed interest rate of 09  for a term of five years ending in september 2019 another swap has a notional amount of 650 million swiss francs and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate of 18  for a term of five years ending in september 2016 another swap has a notional amount of 450 million to effectively 

convert the underlying fixed interest rate of 41 on a portion of the company’s 2500 million private placement notes to variable rate for a term of five years ending february 2016 the interest rates on variable rate term loan debt and commercial paper are consistent with current market conditions therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying values 

at december 31 2015  an increase of 10 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would increase the company’s annual interest expense by approximately 21 million 

commodity risk management 

the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material costs these swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components used in the production of certain of the company’s products the company generally accounts for the commodity swaps as cash flow hedges at december 31 2015 the company had swaps in place to purchase 498 troy ounces of platinum bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 1084 per troy ounce in addition the company had swaps in place to purchase 18285 troy ounces of silver bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 16 per troy ounce 

at december 31 2015  a 10 increase in commodity prices would reduce the fair value liability associated with the commodity swaps by approximately 01 million 

off balance sheet arrangements 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2015  the company had approximately 51300 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 355 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2015  the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 06 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

markets sales and distribution 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for its dental and medical products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsply’s dental and medical products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

developed markets 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental and health products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 80 to 85 of the company’s net sales in these markets dental care is increasingly focused upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as excavation of teeth and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination a broader segment of the population in these markets can afford higher end treatments in both dental and medical care 

emerging markets 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to excavation of teeth and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 15 to 20 of the company’s net sales the company markets products with a diverse price range including dualbrand alternatives to address patient and professional needs however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive a level of dental and medical care similar to that received in developed countries as such many of our premium products are actively sold into these regions 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality innovative products clinical education technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to benefit from opportunities in virtually any market 

dentsply employs approximately 3600 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of its distributors dealers and the endusers 

dental 

dentsply distributes approximately half of its dental products through thirdparty distributors certain highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys dental ceramics crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials orthodontic appliances implants and bone substitute and grafting materials are often sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets no single customer represented ten percent or more of dentsply’s consolidated net sales for the periods presented 

although many of its dental sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools which are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and enduser marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field 

medical 

the company’s urology products are sold directly in approximately 15 countries throughout europe and north america and through distributors in approximately 20 additional markets the company’s largest markets include the uk germany and france key customers include urologists urology nurses general practitioners and directtopatients 

historical reimbursement levels within europe have been higher for intermittent catheters which explain a greater penetration of singleuse catheter products in that market in the us which the company considers an important growth market the reimbursement environment has improved since 2008 as the infection control cost benefits of disposable catheters gain acceptance among payers 

the company’s surgery products are sold directly in approximately13 countries and through distributors in approximately 20 additional markets the company’s largest markets include australia norway and the uk key customers include surgeons hospital nurses physiotherapists hospital purchasing departments and medical supply distributors 

the company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various medical associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in this field 

product development 

innovation and successful product development are critical to keeping market leadership position in key product categories and growing market share in other products categories while strengthening the company’s prominence in the dental and medical markets that it serves while many of dentsply’s existing products undergo brand extensions the company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that represent fundamental change 

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and in select areas of healthcare as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools the company directly invested 808 million 851 million and 854 million in 2014 2013 and 2012  respectively in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the yearoveryear comparison for 2014 versus 2013 was impacted by foreign currency translation which decreased reported expense variations the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the company’s strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry and in select areas in health care 

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions and by entering into licensing agreements with third parties as well as purchasing technologies developed by third parties 

acquisition activities 

dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution although it remains fragmented thereby creating a number of acquisition opportunities dentsply also seeks to expand its position in consumable medical device products through acquisitions 

the company views acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to supplement the company’s core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business including new technologies additional products organizational strength and geographic breadth 

operating and technical expertise

regulation 

the development manufacture sale and distribution of the company’s products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the united states the following sections describe certain but not all of the significant regulations that apply to the company for a description of the risks related to the regulations that the company is subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

certain of the company’s products are classified as medical devices under the united states food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the united states food and drug administration “fda” certain medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold 

dental and medical devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices in the european union dentsply’s products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply products in europe bear the ce mark showing that such products adhere to european regulations 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks of dental amalgams the fda the national institutes of health and the us public health service have each indicated that there are no demonstrated direct adverse health effects due to exposure to dental amalgam in response to concerns 

raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam the fda formed an advisory committee in 2006 to review peerreviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam in july 2009 the fda concluded its review of dental amalgam confirming its use as a safe and effective restorative material also as a result of this review the fda classified amalgam and its component parts elemental mercury and powder alloy as a class ii medical device previously there was no classification for encapsulated amalgam and dental mercury class i and alloy class ii were classified separately this new regulation places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials including composite and gold fillings and makes amalgam subject to special controls by fda in that respect the fda recommended that certain information about dental amalgam be provided which includes information indicating that dental amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor and that studies on people ages six and over as well as fda estimated exposures of children under six have not indicated any adverse health risk associated with the use of dental amalgam after the fda issued this regulation several petitions were filed asking the fda to reconsider its position another advisory panel was established by the fda to consider these petitions hearings of the advisory panel were held in december 2010 the fda has taken no action as of the filing date of this form 10k from the 2010 advisory panel meeting 

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use of amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway in the united states the environmental protection agency proposed in september 2014 certain effluent limitation guidelines and standards under the clean water act to help cut discharges of mercurycontaining dental amalgam to the environment the rule would require affected dentists to use best available technology amalgam separators and other best management practices to control mercury discharges to publiclyowned treatment works the company strongly recommends adherence to the american dental association’s best management practices for amalgam waste and includes this in every package of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply’s business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

negative changes could occur in the dental or medical device markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental and medical device markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which dentsply operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition in many markets dental reimbursement is largely out of pocket for the consumer and thus utilization rates can vary significantly depending on economic growth for instance data suggests that the utilization of dental services by working age adults in the us may have declined over the last several years additionally there is also uncertainty as to what impact the affordable care act may have on dental utilization in the us in certain markets particularly in the european union government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than in other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the company’s results 

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the company’s suppliers and customers and consumers which could harm the company’s financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity as a number of the company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the us changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the company’s customers’ access to credit as well as on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets although the company uses certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the company’s ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

although the company continues to have positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the company’s ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the company’s businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that would not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may be volatile 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to 

 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas in which the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm the company’s business 

the dental and medical device supplies markets are highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

the worldwide markets for dental and medical products are highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the company’s products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsply’s competitors may have greater resources than the company in addition the company is exposed to the risk that its competitors or its customers may introduce private label generic or low cost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points if these competitors’ products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

the market for dentsply’s products is characterized by rapid and significant technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions there can be no assurance that dentsply’s products will not become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the company’s investment in 

product development if the company’s products or technologies become noncompetitive or obsolete dentsply’s business could be negatively affected 

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable us or international government or regulatory authorities or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the company’s products obsolete

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws regulations and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws regulations and orders there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws regulations and orders failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 the company received subpoenas from the united states attorney’s office for the southern district of indiana the “usao” and from ofac requesting documents and information related to compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain of its subsidiaries the company also voluntarily contacted ofac and bis regarding compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain other business units of the company identified in an ongoing internal review by the company the company is cooperating with the usao ofac and bis with respect to these matters 

the company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs the company may announce from time to time restructuring plans including workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings the company has targeted adjusted operating income margins to expand to 20 as the benefits of these initiatives are realized over time due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities the company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits and its operations and business could be disrupted company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions and implementation may require the agreement of the company’s labor unions risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected negative impact on the company’s relationship with labor unions adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors dentsply may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the company’s ability to deliver products to customers if the company is unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner or if the company encounters delays or other difficulties in the supply or manufacturing of such products and other materials internally or from third parties the company’s business and results of operations may be harmed 

dentsply may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances 

dentsply must obtain certain approvals and marketing clearances from governmental authorities including the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries to manufacture market and sell its products these regulatory agencies regulate the marketing manufacturing labeling packaging advertising sale and distribution of medical devices including the export of medical devices to foreign countries 

the regulatory review process which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device may delay or hinder a product’s timely entry into the marketplace there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect the company the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance delays or failure to receive the necessary product approvals from governmental authorities could negatively impact dentsply’s operations 

there also can be no assurance that regulatory agencies may not disallow the use of certain raw material components which could have a negative impact on the company’s ability to manufacture market and sell particular products or product lines 

inventories maintained by the company’s customers may fluctuate from time to time 

the company relies in part on its predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results these inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

the company is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions unanticipated changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results of operations the company’s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by factors such as changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company does business by structural changes in the company’s businesses by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit or by changes in the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

challenges may be asserted against the company’s products due to real or perceived quality or health issues 

the company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products while the company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time 

regarding the real or perceived quality or health impact of the company’s products or certain raw material components of the company’s products all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenola commonly called bpa bpa is found in many everyday items such as plastic bottles foods detergents and toys and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a byproduct of other ingredients that have degraded or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants the fda currently allows the use of bpa in dental materials medical devices and food packaging nevertheless public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of bpa could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the company’s products that contain mercury or bpa adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products whether or not ultimately based on fact may have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and operating results 

issues related to the quality and safety of the company’s products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall or discontinuation resulting in harm to the company’s reputation and negatively impacting the company’s operating results 

the company’s products generally maintain a good reputation with customers and endusers issues related to quality and safety of products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize the company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for the company’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions the company may need to recall or discontinue products if they become unfit for use in addition the company could potentially be subject to litigation or government action which could result in payment of fines or damages cost associated with these potential actions could negatively affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the company’s orthodontics business is subject to risk 

the company sources a substantial portion of its orthodontic products from a japanese supplier under an agreement that is subject to periodic renewal the company also has established alternative sources of supply the market for orthodontic products is highly competitive and subject to significant negative price pressure 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable charges to operations 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures it is possible that future accounting standards the company would be required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment applied to the company’s consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

if the company’s goodwill or intangible assets become impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap the company reviews its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill or intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates net sales growth discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows are critical assumptions used to determine these fair values slower net sales growth rates in the dental or medical device industries an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flows among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets is determined 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks 

in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe 

we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply’s revenue operating in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees 

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the company’s products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the company’s products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

a large number of the company’s products are manufactured in single manufacturing facilities 

although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

dentsply operates many aspects of its business including financial reporting and customer relationship management through server and webbased technologies and stores various types of data on such servers or with thirdparties who may in turn store it on servers or in the “cloud” any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations while dentsply has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsply’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsply’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered 

dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsply’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

the company has debt securities outstanding of approximately 13 billion dentsply also has the ability to incur up to 500 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsply’s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

dentsply’s current indebtedness contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy under the agreements governing the dentsply 411 senior notes due 2016 the company will be required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda of less than or equal to 350 to 100 the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratio but no assurance can be given that dentsply will be able to do so dentsply’s failure to maintain such ratio or a breach of the other covenants under its debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

we utilize the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including our access to the unsecured borrowing market we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents and of delaware law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply 

certain provisions of dentsply’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include among others a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements 

which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsply’s bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsply’s management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock 

the company’s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event 

the company operates in more than 120  countries and its and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the company’s business and consolidated results of operations any insurance maintained by the company may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions and our emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future

2014  operational highlights 

 

 

 

 

business 

dentsply international inc is a leading manufacturer and distributor of dental and other consumable medical device products the company believes it is the world’s largest manufacturer of consumable dental products for the professional dental market for over 115 years dentsply’s commitment to innovation and professional collaboration has enhanced its portfolio of branded consumables and small equipment headquartered in the united states the company has global operations with sales in more than 120 countries the company also has strategically located distribution centers to enable it to better serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency while the united states and europe are the company’s largest markets the company serves all major markets worldwide 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal sales growth by geographic region 2 constant currency sales growth by geographic region 3 adjusted operating margins of each reportable segment including product pricing and cost controls 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products and 5 sales growth through acquisition 

the company defines “internal sales growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 net acquisition sales growth the company also tracks internal sales growth of continuing product lines as this is more reflective of the ongoing strength of the company’s performance the company defines “net acquisition sales growth” as the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months following the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired less the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months prior to the transaction date of businesses that have been divested the company defines “constant currency sales growth” as internal sales growth plus net acquisition sales growth 

the primary drivers of internal growth includes global dental market growth innovation and new products launched by the company and continued investments in sales and marketing resources including clinical education management believes that over time the company’s ability to execute its strategies allows it to grow at a modest premium to the growth rate of the underlying dental market management further believes that the global dental market has generally in the past and should over time in the future grow at a premium to underlying economic growth rates considering all of these factors the company assumes that the longterm growth rate for the dental market will range from 3 to 6 on average and that the company targets a slight premium to market growth over the past several years growth in the global dental and other healthcare markets have been restrained by lower economic growth in western europe and certain other markets compared to historical averages and accordingly market growth rates and the company’s internal growth rate remains uncertain in the near term 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes at the beginning of the first or fourth quarters price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period 

the company also has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions to reduce costs in addition the company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives the company believes that the benefits from these initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance in connection with these efforts the company targets adjusted operating income margins to expand to 20 as the benefits of these initiatives are realized over time in addition the company expects that it will record restructuring charges from time to time associated with such initiatives these restructuring charges could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements and there can be no assurance that the target adjusted operating income margins will be achieved consistent with these efforts the company announced during 2014 that it is proposing steps in germany to reorganize elements of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities the company seeks to realign its portfolio of laboratory products with increased focus on innovative prosthetics materials while deemphasizing its cadcam equipment business as required under german law the company continues to participate in a statutory codetermination process under which it is collaborating with the appropriate labor groups to jointly define the infrastructure and staffing adjustments necessary to support this initiative 

product innovation is a key component of the company’s overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental and consumable medical device products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings through acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates have experienced consolidation they remain fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

impact of foreign currencies and interest rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange and interest rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with more than 65 of the company’s net sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar this impact is anticipated to be significant in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a dramatic weakening of the euro in the latter half of 2014 and early 2015 and the strengthening of the swiss franc in early 2015 additionally movements in certain foreign exchange and interest rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior year’s data in order to conform to current year presentation specifically during the first quarter of 2014 the company realigned reporting responsibilities for multiple locations as a result of changes to the management reporting structure the segment information reflects the revised structure for all periods shown 

results of operations 

2014  compared to 2013 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency sales growth which includes internal sales growth and net acquisition sales growth and 2 foreign currency translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 



during 2014 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 210 million from 2013 the 08 increase in net sales excluding precious metal content included constant currency sales growth of 18 the constant currency sales growth was comprised of internal sales growth of 12 and acquisition sales growth of 06 the decline of precious metal content of sales from the year ago period was primarily due to the continuing reduction in the use of precious metal alloys in dentistry

united states

europe 

during 2014 net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 02 on a constant currency basis compared to 2013 internal sales growth in europe was muted as the result of a substantial and continuing decline in sales within the cis countries due to economic and political instability in those markets excluding sales in the cis region constant currency sales growth would have been 18 led by increased sales in the dental specialty dental consumables and consumable medical device product categories partially offset by the dental laboratory product category

in addition to the results reported in accordance with us gaap the company provides adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international and adjusted earnings per diluted common share “adjusted eps” the company discloses adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the company and certain large noncash charges related to purchased intangible assets the company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation 

adjusted net income and adjusted eps are important internal measures for the company senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income and adjusted eps and the performance of the company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics 





adjusted operating income and margin 

adjusted operating income and margin is another important internal measure for the company operating income in accordance with us gaap is adjusted for the items noted above which are excluded on a pretax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income a nonus gaap measure the adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales excluding precious metal content 

senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income the performance of the company is measured on this basis along with the adjusted nonus gaap earnings noted above as well as other performance metrics adjusted operating income is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states therefore it is a nonus gaap measure this nonus gaap measure may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 





operating segment results 

the company’s operating businesses are combined into operating groups which have overlapping product offerings geographic presence customer bases distribution channels and regulatory oversight these operating groups are considered the company’s reportable segments as the company’s chief operating decisionmaker regularly reviews financial results at the operating group level and uses this information to manage the company’s operations each of these operating groups covers a wide range of product categories and geographic regions the product categories and geographic regions often overlap across the groups further information regarding the details of each group is presented in note 5 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k the management of each group is evaluated for performance and incentive compensation purposes on net third party sales excluding precious metal content and segment operating income 





dental consumable and certain international businesses   

net sales excluding precious metal content increased 228 million or 36 during 2013 as compared to 2012 sales on a constant currency basis increased by 30 

operating income increased 11 million during 2013 compared to 2012 the improvement in operating income was primarily the result of sales growth 

dental specialty and laboratory and certain global distribution businesses   

net sales excluding precious metal content increased 170 million or 11 during 2013 compared to 2012 sales grew on a constant currency basis by 11 the constant currency growth was primarily the result of increased sales in the specialty dental businesses despite a decline in implant sales 

operating income increased 70 million during 2013 compared to 2012 modest operating income improvements were primarily driven by the dental specialty businesses 

healthcare and emerging markets businesses   

net sales excluding precious metal content increased 177 million or 34 during 2013 compared to 2012 sales increased by 37 on a constant currency basis the constant currency growth was primarily the result of increased sales in the healthcare businesses and in certain emerging markets 

operating income improved by 37 million or 169 in 2013 compared to 2012 the improvement in operating income was primarily the result of sales growth 

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions   

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these 

assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including future sales growth operating margin growth benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending business initiatives and working capital changes these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

the performance of the company’s 2014  annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the company’s goodwill the wacc rates utilized in the 2014  analysis ranged from 86 to 140 had the wacc rate of each of the company’s reporting units been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at april 30 2014  the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5 at april 30 2014  the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at april 30 2014  due to competitive conditions one reporting unit within the dental specialties and laboratory and certain global distribution business segment would have a net book value exceeding its fair value by approximately 59 million goodwill for this reporting unit totals 1227 million at april 30 2014  to the extent that future operating results of this reporting unit do not meet the forecasted cash flows the company can provide no assurance that a future goodwill impairment charge would not be incurred 

at december 31 2014 the company updated its goodwill impairment testing for the reporting unit noted above as well as for one reporting unit in the healthcare and emerging markets business segment based on current year financial performance the review did not result in any impairment of the reporting units’ respective goodwill balances assumptions used in the calculations of fair value were substantially consistent with those at april 30 2014 if the wacc rate of these two reporting units had been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at december 31 2014 the fair value of these two reporting units would still exceed net book value if the fair value of these two reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5 the reporting unit within the healthcare and emerging markets businesses segment would have had a net book value exceeding its fair value by approximately 04 million if the fair value of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at december 31 2014 the reporting unit within healthcare and emerging markets businesses segment would have had a net book value exceeding fair value by approximately 40 million and the reporting unit within the dental specialties and laboratory and certain global distribution business segment would have had a fair value exceeding its net book value by approximately 51 million goodwill for the two reporting units totals 1390 million at december 31 2014 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets 

the fair value of acquired tradenames is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including projected revenue royalty rates and appropriate discount rates royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

the performance of the company’s 2014  annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the company’s indefinitelived assets if the fair value of each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10 or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at december 31 2014  the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the use of the tradenames it could result in impairment of the carrying value of the indefinitelived assets to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future indefinitelived asset impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges are a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred 

income taxes 

income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes the company’s tax expense includes the us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested 

the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 

certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely at december 31 2014  the company has a valuation allowance of 2532 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions the reversal of accruals is recorded when examinations are completed statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed

the following table presents the companys scheduled contractual cash obligations at december 31 2014 



due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 307 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 14  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company these cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months and do not change the underlying long term foreign currency exchange risk the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level cross currency basis swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment 

at december 31 2014  a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would improve the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts and the cross currency basis swaps by approximately 336 million 

interest rate risk management 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt and to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2014 the company has three groups of significant interest rate swaps one of the groups of swaps has notional amounts totaling 125 billion japanese yen and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed interest rate of 09 for a term of five years ending in september 2019 another swap has a notional amount of 650 million swiss francs and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate of 07 for a term of five years ending in september 2016 another swap has a notional amount of 1050 million to effectively convert the underlying fixed interest rate of 41 on a portion of the company’s 2500 million private placement notes to variable 

rate for a term of five years ending february 2016 the interest rates on variable rate term loan debt and commercial paper are consistent with current market conditions therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying values 

at december 31 2014  an increase of 10 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 32 million 

commodity risk management 

the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material costs these swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components used in the production of certain of the company’s products the company generally accounts for the commodity swaps as cash flow hedges at december 31 2014 the company had swaps in place to purchase 1068 troy ounces of platinum bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 1306 per troy ounce in addition the company had swaps in place to purchase 58206 troy ounces of silver bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 18 per troy ounce 

at december 31 2014  a 10 increase in commodity prices would reduce the fair value liability associated with the commodity swaps by approximately 02 million 

off balance sheet arrangements 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2014  the company had 79375 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 568 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2014  the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 04 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

markets sales and distribution 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for its dental and medical products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsply’s dental and medical products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

developed markets 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental and health products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 80 to 85 of the company’s net sales in these markets dental care is increasingly focused upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as excavation of teeth and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination a broader segment of the population in these markets can afford higher end treatments in both dental and medical care 

emerging markets 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to excavation of teeth and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 15 to 20 of the company’s net sales the company markets products with a diverse price range including dualbrand alternatives to address patient and professional needs however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive excellent dental and medical care similar to that received in developed countries as such our premium products are actively sold into these regions 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products clinical education and technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to benefit from opportunities in virtually any market 

dentsply employs approximately 3600 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the distributors dealers and the endusers 

dental 

dentsply distributes approximately half of its dental products through thirdparty distributors certain highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys dental ceramics crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials orthodontic appliances implants and bone substitute and grafting materials are sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets during 2013 and 2012 the company did not have any single customer that represented ten percent or more of dentsply’s consolidated net sales in 2011 one customer henry schein incorporated a dental distributor accounted for 11 of dentsply’s consolidated net sales no other single customer represented ten percent or more of dentsply’s consolidated net sales during 2011 

although many of its dental sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools which are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and enduser marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the company’s products in the future 

medical 

the company’s urology products business reaches the market directly in 16 countries throughout europe and north america and through distributors in 18 additional markets the largest markets include the uk germany and france sales efforts target urologists urology nurses general practitioners and directtopatients 

historical reimbursement levels within europe have been higher for intermittent catheters which explain a greater penetration of singleuse catheter products in that market in the us which the company considers an important growth market the reimbursement environment has improved since 2008 as the infection control cost benefits of disposable catheters gain acceptance among payers 

the surgery products business operates directly in 13 countries throughout europe and australia with distributors in 21 additional markets the largest markets include australia norway and the uk sales efforts target surgeons hospital nurses physiotherapists hospital purchasing departments and medical supply distributors 

the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various medical associates professional and key opinion leaders to help promote our products although there are no assurances that they will continue to support the company’s products in the future 

product development 

innovation and successful product development are critical to keeping market leadership position in key product categories and growing market share in other products categories while strengthening the company’s prominence in the dental and medical markets that it serves while many of dentsply’s existing products undergo brand extensions the company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that represent fundamental change 

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and in select areas of healthcare as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools the company directly invested 851 million 854 million and 667 million in 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the company’s strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry and in select areas in health care 

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions and by entering into licensing agreements with third parties as well as purchasing technologies developed by third parties 

acquisition activities 

dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution although it remains fragmented thereby creating a number of acquisition opportunities dentsply also seeks to expand its position in consumable medical device products through acquisitions 

the company views acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to supplement the company’s core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business including new technologies additional products and geographic breadth 

operating and technical expertise 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacturing process of the company’s products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the company’s products the company endeavors to automate its global manufacturing operations in order to improve quality and customer service and lower costs

competition 

the company conducts its operations both domestic and foreign under highly competitive market conditions competition in the dental and medical products industries is based primarily upon product performance quality safety and ease of use as well as price customer service innovation and acceptance by professionals technicians and patients dentsply believes that its principal strengths include its wellestablished brand names its reputation for high quality and innovative products its leadership in product development and manufacturing the breadth of its product line its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the company’s products by dental and medical professionals 

the size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company 

regulation 

the company’s products are subject to regulation by among other governmental entities the us food and drug administration the “fda” in general if a dental or medical “device” is subject to fda regulation compliance with the fda’s requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations in order to ensure that dental and medical products distributed for human use in the us are safe and effective the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and sale of dental and medical products of the types produced by the company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with the fda and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations 

dental and medical devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices in the european union dentsply’s products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply products in europe bear the ce mark showing that such products adhere to european regulations 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged 

potential risks of dental amalgams the fda’s dental devices classification panel the national institute of health and the us public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated in response to concerns raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam the fda formed an advisory committee in 2006 to review peerreviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam in july 2009 the fda concluded its review of dental amalgam confirming its use as a safe and effective restorative material also as a result of this review the fda classified amalgam and its component parts elemental mercury and powder alloy as a class ii medical device previously there was no classification for encapsulated amalgam and dental mercury class i and alloy class ii were classified separately this new regulation places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials including composite and gold fillings and makes amalgam subject to special controls by fda in that respect the fda recommended that certain information about dental amalgam be provided which includes information indicating that dental amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor and that studies on people age six and over as well as fda estimated exposures of children under six have not indicated any adverse health risk associated with the use of dental amalgam after the fda issued this regulation several petitions were filed asking the fda to reconsider its position another advisory panel was established by the fda to consider these petitions hearings of the advisory panel were held in december 2010 the fda has taken no action as of the filing date of this form 10k from this latest advisory panel meeting 

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use of amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

sources and supply of raw materials and finished goods 

the company manufactures the majority of the products sold by the company most of the raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources no single supplier accounts for more than 10 of dentsply’s requirements 

intellectual property 

products manufactured by dentsply are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names dentsply also owns and maintains more than 2500 patents throughout the world and is licensed under a small number of patents owned by others 

dentsply’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations both in the us and in significant international markets the company carefully monitors trademark use worldwide and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company dentsply believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the company’s marketing position but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark 

employees

other factors affecting the business 

approximately twothirds of the company’s sales are located in regions outside the us and the company’s consolidated net sales can be impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the first or fourth quarter price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period sales for the industry and the company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

the company tries to maintain short lead times within its manufacturing as such the backlog on products is generally not material to the financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply’s business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

negative changes could occur in the dental or medical device markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental and medical device markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which dentsply operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition in many markets dental reimbursement is largely out of pocket for the consumer and thus utilization rates can vary significantly depending on economic growth for instance data suggests that the utilization of dental services by working age adults in the us may have declined over the last several years additionally there is also uncertainty as to what impact the affordable care act may have on dental utilization in the us in certain markets particularly in the european union government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than in other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the company’s results 

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the company’s suppliers and customers and consumers which could harm the company’s financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the company’s sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity although the company uses certain financial tools to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the company 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the company’s ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

  

although the company continues to have positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the company’s ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the company’s businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that would not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may be volatile 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including but not limited to 

 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline the quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas in which the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm the company’s business 

the dental and medical device supplies markets are highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

the worldwide markets for dental and medical products are highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the company’s products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsply’s competitors may have greater resources than the company in addition the company is exposed to the risk that its competitors or its customers may introduce private label generic or low cost products that compete with the company’s products at lower price points if these competitors’ products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall this could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

inventories maintained by the company’s customers may fluctuate from time to time 

the company relies in part on its predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results these inventory levels may fluctuate and may differ from the company’s predictions resulting in the company’s projections of future results being different than expected there can be no assurance that the company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the company’s predictions or past history

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable us or international government or regulatory authorities or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the company’s products obsolete 

dentsply may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances

the regulatory review process which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device may delay or hinder a product’s timely entry into the marketplace there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect the company the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance delays or failure to receive the necessary product approvals from governmental authorities could negatively impact dentsply’s operations 

dentsply’s business is subject to extensive complex and changing laws regulations and orders that failure to comply with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 

dentsply is subject to extensive laws regulations and orders which are administered by various international federal and state governmental authorities including among others the fda the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury “ofac” the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of commerce “bis” the united states federal trade commission the united states department of justice and other similar domestic and foreign authorities these regulations include but are not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws the physician payments sunshine act regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals various environmental regulations and regulations relating to trade import and export controls and economic sanctions such laws regulations and orders may be complex and are subject to change 

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws regulations and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws regulations and orders there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws regulations and orders failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 the company received subpoenas from the united states attorney’s office for the southern district of indiana the “usao” and from ofac requesting documents and information related to compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain of its subsidiaries the company also voluntarily contacted ofac and bis regarding compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain other business units of the company identified in an ongoing internal review by the company the company is cooperating with the usao ofac and bis with respect to these matters 

challenges may be asserted against the company’s products due to real or perceived quality or health issues 

the company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products while the company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality or health impact of the company’s products all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenola commonly called bpa bpa is found in many everyday items such as plastic bottles foods detergents and toys and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a byproduct of other ingredients that have degraded or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants the fda currently allows the use of bpa in dental materials medical devices and food packaging nevertheless public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of bpa could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the company’s products that contain mercury or bpa adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products whether or not ultimately based on fact may have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and operating results 

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products certain dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors dentsply may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the company’s ability to deliver products to customers if the company is unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner or if the company encounters delays or other difficulties in the supply or manufacturing of such products and other materials internally or from third parties the company’s business and results of operations may be harmed 

the company is facing increased competition in its orthodontics business as it recovers from a supply disruption in 2011 and 2012 

one of the company’s key suppliers which was the source of certain orthodontic products comprising approximately 9 of the company’s 2010 consolidated net sales excluding precious metal content was located in the zone that was evacuated following the march 2011 tsunami in japan the supplier lost access to its facility and as a result product supply was severely disrupted through the remainder of 2011 and during a portion of 2012 the supplier gradually restored operations in 2012 the company has been recovering a portion of the business lost during the supply disruption but is facing additional competition in part due to capacity added by competition while the company was out of the market and also in part due to new competitors entering the market and from alternative technologies the company continues to source product from its supplier in japan under an agreement that is subject to periodic renewal and has also established alternative sources of supply given the highly competitive conditions in the market there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover market share lost during the product outage or that its existing or alternative sources will be sufficient to allow the company to have a competitive position in the marketplace 

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities andor additional risks or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

the company may fail to successfully complete the integration of astra tech or fully realize the benefits of the acquisition 

the success of the company’s acquisition of astra tech depends upon its ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating astra tech’s business into its operations the company’s ongoing business could be disrupted and management’s attention diverted due to integration planning activities and as a result of the actual integration of the two companies following the acquisition in addition conditions in the dental implant and urological medical device markets including but not limited to market growth increased competition and government regulation may differ from the company’s assumptions and assessments made at the time of the acquisition as a result the company may not fully realize the benefits of the integration as anticipated 

the company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its cost reduction and restructuring efforts 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs the company may announce from time to time restructuring plans including workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities the company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits and its operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair the company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable charges to operations 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures it is possible that future accounting standards the company would be required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment applied to the company’s consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

if the company’s goodwill or intangible assets become impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap the company reviews its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill or intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates net sales growth discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows are critical assumptions used to determine these fair values slower net sales growth rates in the dental or medical device industries an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flows among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets is determined 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

the company is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions unanticipated changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results of operations the company’s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by factors such as changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company does business by structural changes in the company’s businesses by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit or by changes in the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe 

we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsply’s revenue operating in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees  

the company’s success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the company’s products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the company’s products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

a large number of the company’s products are manufactured in single manufacturing facilities 

although the company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities a large number of the products manufactured by the company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products as there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products any disruption at a particular company manufacturing facility could lead to delays increased expenses and may damage the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsply’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsply’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsply’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy any breach of any such covenants or restrictions the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsply’s other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered 

after closing the astra tech acquisition dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsply’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

in connection with the financing of the acquisition of astra tech the company incurred additional debt of approximately 12 billion as a consequence after closing the acquisition dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness dentsply also has the ability to incur up to 500 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsply’s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

dentsply’s current indebtedness contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy under the agreements governing the dentsply’s 411 senior notes due 2016 the company will be required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda of less than or equal to 350 to 100 the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratio but no assurance can be given that dentsply will be able to do so dentsply’s failure to maintain such ratio or a breach of the other covenants under its debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options 

we utilize the short and longterm debt markets to obtain capital from time to time adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options including our access to the unsecured borrowing market we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capitalintensive internal initiatives 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire dentsply 

certain provisions of dentsply’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include among others a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsply’s bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsply’s management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply 

issues related to the quality and safety of the company’s products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall resulting in harm to the company’s reputation and negatively impacting the company’s operating results 

the company’s products generally maintain a good reputation with customers and endusers issues related to quality and safety of products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize the company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for the company’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions the company may need to recall products if they become unfit for use in addition the company could potentially be subject to litigation or government action which could result in payment of fines or damages cost associated with these potential actions could negatively affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the company’s operations 

dentsply operates many aspects of its business including financial reporting and customer relationship management through server and webbased technologies and stores various types of data on such servers or with thirdparties who may in turn store it on servers or in the “cloud” any disruption to the internet or to the company’s or its service providers’ global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the company’s operations while dentsply has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial results

2013 operational highlights 

 

 

 

 

business 

dentsply international inc is a leading manufacturer and distributor of dental and other consumable medical device products the company believes it is the world’s largest manufacturer of consumable dental products for the professional dental market for over 110 years dentsply’s commitment to innovation and professional collaboration has enhanced its portfolio of branded consumables and small equipment headquartered in the united states the company has global operations with sales in more than 120 countries the company also has strategically located distribution centers to enable it to better serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency while the united states and europe are the company’s largest markets the company serves all major markets worldwide 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal sales growth by geographic region 2 constant currency sales growth by geographic region 3 operating margins of each reportable segment including product pricing and cost controls 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products and 5 sales growth through acquisition 

the company defines “internal sales growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 net acquisition sales growth the company defines “net acquisition sales growth” as the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months following 

the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired less the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months prior to the transaction date of businesses that have been divested the company defines “constant currency sales growth” as internal sales growth plus net acquisition sales growth 

the primary drivers of internal growth includes global dental market growth innovation and new products launched by the company and continued investments in sales and marketing resources including clinical education management believes that over time the company’s ability to execute its strategies allows it to grow at a modest premium to the growth rate of the underlying dental market management further believes that the global dental market has generally in the past and should over time in the future grow at a premium to underlying economic growth rates considering all of these factors the company assumes that the longterm growth rate for the dental market will range from 3 to 6 on average and that the company targets a slight premium to market growth over the past several years growth in the global dental and other healthcare markets have been restrained by lower economic growth in western europe and certain other markets compared to historical averages and accordingly market growth rates and the company’s internal growth rate remains uncertain in the near term 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes at the beginning of the first or fourth quarters price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period 

the company has a focus on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions to reduce costs in addition the company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives the company believes that the benefits from these initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance in connection with these efforts the company expects that it will record restructuring charges from time to time associated with such initiatives these restructuring charges could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

product innovation is a key component of the company’s overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental and consumable medical device products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings through acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates have experienced consolidation they remain fragmented management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

impact of foreign currencies 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with 65 to 70 of the company’s net sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior years’ data in order to conform to the current year presentation specifically during the year ended 2013 the company realigned certain implant and implant related businesses as a result of changes to the management structure the segment information below reflects the revised structure for all periods shown 

results of operations 

2013  compared to 2012   

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency sales growth which includes internal sales growth and net acquisition sales growth and 2 foreign currency translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 



during 2013 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 570 million from 2012 the 21 increase in net sales excluding precious metal content included constant currency sales growth of 20 the constant currency sales growth was comprised of internal sales growth of 19 and acquisition sales growth of 01 precious metal content of sales declined compared to the same period in 2012 primarily as a result of a decline in use of precious metal alloys in dentistry 

constant currency sales growth 

the following table includes growth rates for net sales excluding precious metal content 



united states 

during 2013 net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 38 on a constant currency basis the increase was primarily due to internal sales growth in dental specialty and dental consumables product categories 

europe 

during 2013 net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 04 on a constant currency basis including 02 of net acquisition sales growth the increase in net sales excluding precious metal content was primarily driven by an increase in consumable medical products partially offset by lower sales of dental specialty products when compared to the year ago period 

all other regions 

during 2013 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 26 on a constant currency basis the internal sales growth was 27 driven by increased sales across all product categories 

gross profit 



gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content decreased 40 basis points during 2013 compared to 2012 the margin rate decline was primarily the impact of the medical device federal excise tax mandated by the affordable care act that became effective january 1 2013 

expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content improved 100 basis points as compared to 2012 primarily as a result cost savings across a number of businesses and synergies from the integration activities of recent acquisitions 

restructuring and other costs 



the company recorded net restructuring and other costs of 134 million in 2013 compared to 257 million in 2012 in 2013 restructuring costs of 120 million related to the closure and consolidation of facilities in an effort to streamline the company’s operations and better leverage the company’s resources restructuring and other costs also includes net expense of 14 million related to an impairment of previously acquired technology partially offset by a net gain on legal settlements 

in 2012 restructuring and other costs of 257 million included restructuring cost of 178 million related to the implant integration activity as well as the closure and consolidation of facilities in an effort to streamline the company’s operations and 

better leverage the company’s resources restructuring and other costs also included 52 million related to impairment of previously acquired technologies 

other income and expenses 



net interest expense 

net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was 66 million lower compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the net decrease is a result of lower average debt levels in 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and positive net interest recorded on net investment hedges due to lower average interest rates on euro and swiss franc hedge contracts compared to the prior year period the net decrease was partially offset by lower investment income due to lower investment balances lower interest rates and a lower coupon rate on convertible bonds 

other expense income net 

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2013 was 51 million higher compared to the year ended december 31 2012 other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2013 was 83 million comprised primarily of 69 million of interest expense and fair value adjustments on cross currency basis swaps not designated as hedges that offset currency risk on intercompany loans and 21 million of currency transaction losses offset by 07 million of other nonoperating income other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2012 was 32 million including 27 million of currency transaction losses and 05 million of nonoperating expenses 

income taxes and net income 



provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 was 141 and 27 respectively the company’s effective tax rate for 2013 was favorably impacted by the company’s postacquisition restructuring activities the recording of tax benefits of 94 million related to us federal legislative changes enacted in january 2013 relating to 2012 a tax benefit of 22 million for the release of a valuation allowance and 103 million of benefits related to prior year tax matters during 2012 the company entered into various legal entity restructuring activities to complete the integration of the astra tech business acquired in august 2011 in addition to the specific tax integration of the astra tech subsidiaries with legacy dentsply subsidiaries the company also realigned much of its foreign legal entity structure to better align operations and cash management activities as a part of this restructuring the company was able to capture an overall net benefit from anticipated tax losses of 577 million most of the cash flow benefit from this tax matter including utilization of an existing credit carryforward of approximately 496 million will 

be realized over the next several years after 2012 also the company recognized 120 million of tax benefit from a reduction in foreign tax rates and separately recorded a valuation allowance on previously recognized assets of 104 million further information regarding the details of income taxes is presented in note 14 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

in 2013 the company’s effective tax rate included the impact of amortization of purchased intangible assets integration and restructuring and other costs as well as various income tax adjustments which impacted income before taxes and the provisions for income taxes by 729 million and 437 million respectively in 2012 the company’s effective tax rate included the impact of amortization of purchased intangible assets integration and restructuring and other costs as well as various income tax adjustments which impacted income before taxes and the provisions for income taxes by 917 million and 900 million respectively 

equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliated company 

the company’s 17 ownership investment of dio corporation “dio” resulted in a net earnings of 10 million on an aftertax basis for 2013 the equity earnings of dio includes the result of marktomarket changes related to the derivative accounting for the convertible bonds issued by dio to dentsply the company’s portion of the marktomarket net gain incurred by dio was approximately 12 million in 2012 equity in net loss in dio was 33 million on an aftertax basis which includes the company’s portion of the marktomarket net loss incurred by dio of approximately 31 million 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

the portion of consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 07 million from 2013 to 2012 primarily due to increased sales and earnings by such entities 

net income attributable to dentsply international 

in addition to the results reported in accordance with us gaap the company provides adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international and adjusted earnings per diluted common share the company discloses adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and certain large noncash charges related to purchased intangible assets the company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation the adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international consists of net income attributable to dentsply international adjusted to exclude the impact of the following 

1 acquisition related costs  these adjustments include costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process these costs are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends 

2 restructuring and other costs  these adjustments include both costs and income that are irregular in timing amount and impact to the company’s financial performance as such these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends 

3 amortization of purchased intangible assets   this adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets beginning in 2011 the company began recording large noncash charges related to the values attributed to purchased intangible assets these charges have been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to dentsply international to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large noncash charges

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions   

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including future sales growth operating margin growth benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending business initiatives and working capital changes these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

the performance of the company’s 2013 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the company’s goodwill the wacc rates utilized in the 2013 analysis ranged from 84 to 115 if the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10 at april 30 2013 the fair value of each reporting unit would still exceed their net book value had the wacc rate of each of the company’s reporting units been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at april 30 2013 the fair value of all reporting units still exceeds their net book value 

in 2011 the company had a major acquisition that significantly increased the size of the company’s implants and healthcare businesses also in 2011 the company’s orthodontic business suffered a severe supply disruption the company continues to closely monitor these businesses given the size and competitive markets in which they operate goodwill for these reporting units totaled approximately 16 billion at december 31 2013 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

indefinitelived intangible assets consist of tradenames and are not subject to amortization instead they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinitelived assets 

the fair value of acquired tradenames is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an indefinitelived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an indefinitelived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset significant management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions including projected revenue royalty rates and appropriate discount rates royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing 

the performance of the company’s 2013 annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of the company’s indefinitelived assets if the fair value of each of the company’s indefinitelived intangibles assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10 or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value 

in 2011 the company had a major acquisition that significantly increased the size of the company’s implants and healthcare businesses the company continues to closely monitor these businesses given the size and competitive markets in which they operate indefinitelived intangible assets related to these reporting unit totaled approximately 1968 million at december 31 2013 

should the company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the use of the tradenames it could result in impairment of the carrying value of the indefinitelived assets to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the company’s future indefinitelived asset impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges are a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has estimated liabilities for probable losses well in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred 

income taxes 

income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes the company’s tax expense includes the us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested 

the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 

certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely at december 31 2013 the company recorded a valuation allowance of 2288 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the company’s major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the company’s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level cross currency basis swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge 

some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment 

at december 31 2013 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would improve the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts and the cross currency basis swaps by approximately 818 million 

interest rate risk management 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt and to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at december 31 2013 the company has three groups of significant interest rate swaps one of the groups of swaps has notional amounts totaling 125 billion japanese yen and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed interest rate of 02 for a term of three years ending in september 2014 another swap has a notional amount of 650 million swiss francs and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate of 07 for a term of five years ending in september 2016 another swap has a notional amount of 1500 million to effectively convert the underlying fixed interest rate of 41 on a portion of the company’s 2500 million private placement notes to variable rate for a term of five years ending february 2016 the interest rates on variable rate term loan debt and commercial paper are consistent with current market conditions therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying values 

at december 31 2013 an increase of 10 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 47 million 

commodity risk management 

the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material costs these swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components used in the production of certain of the company’s products the company generally accounts for the commodity swaps as cash flow hedges at december 31 2013 the company had swaps in place to purchase 1062 troy ounces of platinum bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 1452 per troy ounce in addition the company had swaps in place to purchase 79380 troy ounces of silver bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 24 per troy ounce 

at december 31 2013 a 10 increase in commodity prices would reduce the fair value liability associated with the commodity swaps by approximately 03 million 

off balance sheet arrangements 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2013  the company had 171140 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 808 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the 

consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2013  the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 04 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

markets sales and distribution 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for its dental and medical products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental and medical products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

developed markets 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental and health products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 80 to 85 of the companys net sales in these markets dental care is increasingly focused upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as excavation of teeth and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination a broader segment of the population in these markets can afford higher end treatments in both dental and medical care 

developing markets 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to excavation of teeth and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental and medical care these markets account for approximately 15 to 20 of the companys net sales these markets demand diverse products and broader alternatives to address patient and professional needs however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive excellent dental and medical care similar to that received in developed countries as such our higher end products are actively sold into all of these regions 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to benefit from opportunities in virtually any market 

dental 

dentsply distributes approximately half of its dental products through distributors and importers however certain highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys dental ceramics crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials orthodontic appliances implants and bone substitute and grafting materials are sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets during 2012 the company did not have any single customer that represented ten percent or more of dentsplys consolidated net sales in both 2011 and 2010 one customer henry schein incorporated a dental distributor accounted for 11 of dentsplys consolidated net sales no other single customer represented ten percent or more of dentsplys consolidated net sales during 2011 or 2010 

although many of its dental sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools which are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach dentsply employs approximately 3650 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the distributors dealers and the endusers the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and enduser marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the companys products in the future 

medical 

the companys urology products business operates directly in 15 countries throughout europe and north america with distributors in 22 additional markets the largest markets include germany uk france and italy sales channels target urologists urology nurses general practitioners and directtopatients 

the surgery products business operates directly in 11 countries throughout europe and australia with distributors in 25 additional markets the largest markets include uk italy and australia sales channels target surgeons hospital nurses physiotherapists hospital purchasing departments and medical supply distributors 

historical reimbursement levels within europe are higher for hydrophilic catheters which explain a greater patient usage of hydrophilic products in that market in the us the reimbursement environment has improved since 2008 as the infection control cost benefits of disposable catheters gain acceptance among payers 

the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various medical associates professional and key opinion leaders to help promote our products although there are no assurances that they will continue to support the companys products in the future 

product development 

technological innovation and successful product development are critical to strengthening the companys prominent position in the dental and medical markets that it serves it is also required to maintain and grow its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high market share and to grow market share in other product categories while many of dentsplys existing products undergo brand extensions the company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that represent fundamental change 

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and in select areas of healthcare as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools the company directly invested 854 million 667 million and 494 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the companys strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry and in select areas in health care 

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions and by entering into licensing agreements with third parties as well as purchasing technologies developed by third parties 

acquisition activities 

dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution although it remains fragmented thereby creating a number of acquisition opportunities dentsply also seeks to expand its position in consumable medical device products through acquisitions 

the company views acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to supplement the companys core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business including new technologies additional products and geographic breadth 

operating and technical expertise 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacturing process of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products the company continues to automate its global manufacturing operations in order to lower costs 

financing 

information about dentsplys working capital liquidity and capital resources is provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k 

competition 

the company conducts its operations both domestic and foreign under highly competitive market conditions competition in the dental and medical products industries is based primarily upon product performance quality safety and ease of use as well as price customer service innovation and acceptance by professionals technicians and patients dentsply believes that its principal strengths include its wellestablished brand names its reputation for high quality and innovative products its leadership in product development and manufacturing its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the companys products by dental and medical professionals 

the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company 

regulation 

the companys products are subject to regulation by among other governmental entities the us food and drug administration the “fda” in general if a dental or medical “device” is subject to fda regulation compliance with the fdas requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations in order to ensure that dental and medical products distributed for human use in the us are safe and effective the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and sale of dental and medical products of the types produced by the company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with the fda and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations 

dental and medical devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices in the european union dentsplys products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply products in europe bear the ce mark showing that such products adhere to european regulations 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks of dental amalgams the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institute of health and the us public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated in response to concerns raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam the fda formed an advisory committee in 2006 to review peerreviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam in july 2009 the fda concluded its review 

of dental amalgam confirming its use as a safe and effective restorative material also as a result of this review the fda classified amalgam and its component parts elemental mercury and powder alloy as a class ii medical device previously there was no classification for encapsulated amalgam and dental mercury class i and alloy class ii were classified separately this new regulation places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials including composite and gold fillings and makes amalgam subject to special controls by fda in that respect fda recommended that certain information about dental amalgam be provided which includes information indicating that dental amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor that studies on people age six and over and fda estimated exposures of children under six have not indicated any adverse health risk associated with the use of dental amalgam after the fda issued this regulation several petitions were filed asking the fda to reconsider its position another advisory panel was established by the fda to consider these petitions hearings of the advisory panel were held in december 2010 the fda has taken no action as of the filing date of this form 10k from this latest advisory panel meeting 

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use of amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

sources and supply of raw materials and finished goods 

the company manufactures the majority of the products sold by the company most of the raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources no single supplier accounts for more than 10 of dentsplys requirements 

intellectual property 

products manufactured by dentsply are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names dentsply also owns and maintains more than 2500 patents throughout the world and is licensed under a small number of patents owned by others 

dentsplys policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations both in the us and in significant international markets the company carefully monitors trademark use worldwide and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company dentsply believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the companys marketing position but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 11900 employees of these employees approximately 3500 were employed in the united states and 8400 in countries outside of the united states less than 5 of employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements some employees outside of the united states are covered by collective bargaining union contract or other similar type program the company believes that it has a positive relationship with its employees 

environmental matters 

dentsply believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations maintaining this level of compliance has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on the companys capital expenditures or on its business 

other factors affecting the business 

approximately twothirds of the companys sales are located in regions outside the us and the companys consolidated net sales can be impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the companys business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically 

implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the first or fourth quarter price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period sales for the industry and the company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

 the company maintains short lead times within its manufacturing as such the backlog on products is not material to the financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsplys business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

negative changes could occur in the dental markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which dentsply operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition many of the companys markets are affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs in certain markets particularly in the european union government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the companys results 

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the companys suppliers and customers and consumers which could harm the companys financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the companys supply chain and the customers and consumers of the companys products and may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the companys international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsplys business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the companys sales located in regions outside the us and the companys consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the companys ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

  

although the company continues to have positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the companys ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the companys businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that would not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

the companys quarterly operating results and market price for the companys common stock may be volatile 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the companys control including

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline the quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsplys common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not necessarily limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the companys industry and competitors the companys financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsplys common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the companys common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could harm the companys business 

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

the worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsplys competitors may have greater resources than the company 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

the market for dentsplys products is characterized by rapid and significant technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions there can be no assurance that dentsplys products will not become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the companys investment in product development if the companys products or technologies become noncompetitive or obsolete dentsplys business could be negatively affected 

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable us or international government or regulatory authorities or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors new products will not be introduced that could render the companys products obsolete 

  

dentsply may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances 

dentsply must obtain certain approvals and marketing clearances from governmental authorities including the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell its products these regulatory agencies regulate the marketing manufacturing labeling packaging advertising sale and distribution of medical devices including the export of medical devices to foreign countries 

the regulatory review process which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device may delay or hinder a products timely entry into the marketplace there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect the company the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance delays or failure to receive the necessary product approvals from governmental authorities could negatively impact dentsplys operations 

dentsplys business is subject to extensive complex and changing laws regulations and orders that failure to comply with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 

dentsply is subject to extensive laws regulations and orders which are administered by various international federal and state governmental authorities including among others the fda the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury ofac the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of commerce bis the united states federal trade commission the united states department of justice and other similar domestic and foreign authorities these regulations include but are not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws the physician payments sunshine act regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals various environmental regulations and regulations relating to trade import and export controls and economic sanctions such laws regulations and orders may be complex and are subject to change 

compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws regulations and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws regulations and orders there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws regulations and orders failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions including fines or penalties injunctions andor criminal or other civil proceedings any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the companys reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 the company received subpoenas from the united states attorneys office for the southern district of indiana the “usao” and from ofac requesting documents and information related to compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain of its subsidiaries the company also voluntarily contacted ofac and bis regarding compliance with export controls and economic sanctions regulations by certain other business units of the company identified in an ongoing internal review by the company the company is cooperating with the usao ofac and bis with respect to these matters 

challenges may be asserted against the companys dental amalgam product 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury   some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the companys sales of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

a significant portion of the companys injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products certain dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the companys products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time or supply products to competitors dentsply may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the companys ability to deliver products to customers if the company is unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner or if the company encounters delays or other difficulties in the supply or manufacturing of such products and other materials internally or from third parties the companys business and results of operation may be harmed 

the company has lost customers of its orthodontics business due to the disruption in its ability to source certain orthodontic products from its key supplier located in japans evacuation area 

  

one of the companys key suppliers which was the source of certain orthodontic products comprising approximately 9 of the companys 2010 consolidated net sales excluding precious metal content was located in the zone that was evacuated following the march 2011 tsunami in japan the supplier lost access to its facility and as a result product supply was severely disrupted through the remainder of 2011 the supplier gradually restored operations in 2012 although the company had secured limited alternative sources of supply during the shortage there is no assurance that customers who turned to other sources of products during the companys period of product shortages will return to the companys products 

the companys expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert managements attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

the company may fail to successfully integrate astra tech or realize the benefits of the acquisition 

the success of the companys acquisition of astra tech depends upon its ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating astra techs business into its operations the companys ongoing business could be disrupted and managements attention diverted due to integration planning activities and as a result of the actual integration of the two companies following the acquisition the company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration on a timely basis or at all 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable charges to operations 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures it is possible that future accounting standards the company would be required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment applied to the companys consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

if the companys goodwill or intangible assets become impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap the company reviews its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill or intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates net sales growth discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows are critical assumptions used to determine these fair values slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flows among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the companys goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the companys goodwill or intangible assets is determined 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules operating structures country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the companys effective tax rates 

the company is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions unanticipated changes in the companys tax rates could affect its future results of operations the companys future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company does business by structural changes in the companys businesses by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit or by changes 

in the valuation of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the companys business involves a risk of product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the companys products the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the companys products infringe upon such partys intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe 

we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsplys revenue operating in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees  

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsplys ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertains to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered 

after closing the astra tech acquisition dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsplys debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

in connection with the financing of the acquisition of astra tech the company incurred additional debt of approximately 12 billion as a consequence after closing the acquisition dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness dentsply also has the ability to incur up to 500 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsplys level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

dentsplys current indebtedness contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy under the agreements governing the dentsplys 411 senior notes due 2016 the company will be required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda of less than or equal to 350 to 100 the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratio but no assurance can be given that dentsply will be able to do so dentsplys failure to maintain such ratio or a breach of the other covenants under its debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies 

certain provisions in the companys governing documents may make it more difficult for third party offerors to acquire dentsply 

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include among others the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply 

issues related to the quality and safety of the companys products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall resulting in harm to the companys reputation and negatively impacting the companys operating results 

the companys products generally maintain a good reputation with customers and endusers issues related to quality and safety of products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize the companys image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for the companys products or cause production and delivery disruptions the company may need to recall products if they become unfit for use in addition the company could potentially be subject to litigation or government action which could result in payment of fines or damages cost associated with these potential actions could negatively affect the companys operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the companys operations 

dentsply operates many aspects of its business including financial reporting and customer relationship management through 

server and webbased technologies and stores various types of data on such servers or with thirdparties who may in turn store it on servers or in the “cloud” any disruption to the internet or to the companys or its service providers global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the companys operations while dentsply has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the companys operations and financial results

significant developments in 2012 

 

 

 

business 

dentsply international inc is a leading manufacturer and distributor of d ental and other consumable medical device products the company believes it is the worlds largest manufacturer of consumable dental products for the professional dental market for over 110 years dentsplys commitment to innovation and professional collaboration has enhanced its portfolio of branded consumables and small equipment headquartered in the united states the company has global operations with sales in more than 120 countries the company also has strategically located distribution centers to enable it to better serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency while the united states and europe are the companys largest markets the company serves all major markets worldwide 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal growth by geographic region 2 constant currency growth by geographic region 3 operating margins of each reportable segment including product pricing and cost controls 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products and 5 growth through acquisition 

the company defines “internal growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 net acquisition growth the company defines “net acquisition growth” as the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months following the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired less the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months prior to the transaction date of businesses that have been divested the company defines “constant currency growth” as internal growth plus net acquisition growth 

management believes that internal growth in the range of 3 to 6 is a longterm targeted rate for the company the internal growth rate may vary outside of this range based on economic conditions historical trends show that growth in the dental industry generally performs better than the overall economy however it typically lags the economic trend going into and coming out of slower growth or recessionary periods there can be no assurance that the companys assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets will continue in the future if such rates are less than expected the companys projected growth rates and results of operations may be adversely affected 

price changes other marketing and promotional programs offered to customers from time to time the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales and inventory levels in a given period 

the company has a focus on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions to reduce costs in addition the company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives the company believes that the benefits from these initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance 

product innovation is a key component of the companys overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the company operates as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental and consumable medical device products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the companys product offerings through acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates has experienced consolidation it is still a fragmented industry management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future however it will be very focused in the nearterm on the integration of its recent acquisitions and associated debt reduction 

impact of the natural disaster in japan and orthodontic recovery 

the companys orthodontic and japanese businesses have been negatively impacted as a result of the natural disaster that occurred in japan in march of 2011 the impact for the year ended december 31 2012 on the companys sales of orthodontic products was a slight increase in net sales and earnings as compared with 2011 resulting in a positive 001 impact to the periods yearoveryear earnings per diluted share 

impact of foreign currencies 

due to the international nature of dentsplys business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with 65 to 70 of the companys net sales located in regions outside the us the companys consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior years data in order to conform to current year presentation specifically during the first quarter of 2012 the company realigned reporting responsibilities for multiple locations as a result of changes to the management structure the segment information below reflects the revised structure for all periods shown 

results of operations 

2012 compared to 2011 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency which includes internal growth and acquisition growth and 2 foreign currency 

translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 



in 2012 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 3821 million from 2011 the 164 increase in net sales excluding precious metal content included constant currency growth of 202 and currency translation which decreased net sales excluding precious metal content by 38 the constant currency sales growth was comprised of internal growth of 40 and acquisition growth of 162 

constant currency sales growth 

the following table includes growth rates for net sales excluding precious metal content 



internal growth excluding the japanese market and orthodontic business was substantially the same and varied by no more than one percentage point in any region 

united states 

during 2012 net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 138 on a constant currency basis including 102 of acquisition growth the internal growth rate was 36 due to increased demand across all product categories 

europe 

during 2012 net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 275 on a constant currency basis including 249 of acquisition growth the internal growth rate was 26 and was primarily driven by sales growth in the dental specialty dental consumable and consumable medical device products partially offset by decreased demand for precious metal alloy products within the dental laboratory products category 

all other regions 

during 2012 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 159 on a constant currency basis which includes 87 of acquisition growth the internal growth was 72 driven by sales growth in all dental product categories 

gross profit 



gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content increased 27 during 2012 compared to 2011 the gross profit rate was positively impacted by improved product pricing favorable product mix primarily associated with recent acquisitions as well as a favorable rate impact from changes in foreign currency translation rates offset by higher manufacturing costs in 2011 the gross profit rate was negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points from expensing inventory for the fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions 

expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content was 21 higher than in 2011 increased sga expenses as a percent of net sales excluding precious metal content was a result of the higher expense rate of the astra tech business and 309 million of amortization primarily associated with 2011 acquisitions as well as key global marketing events 

restructuring and other costs 



the company recorded net restructuring and other costs of 257 million in 2012 compared to 359 million in 2011 in 2012 restructuring cost of 178 million were related to the implant integration activity as well as the closure and consolidation of facilities in an effort to streamline the companys operations and better leverage the companys resources restructuring and other costs also include 52 million related to an impairment of previously acquired technology 

in 2011 these costs were related to expenses associated with the acquisition of astra tech of 180 million legal settlement cost of 126 million as well as restructuring costs primarily related to the orthodontic business also the company recorded 

certain other costs of 15 million related to an impairment of an intangible asset 

the benefits associated with the 2011 and 2012  restructuring plans were immaterial to the current period the company estimates the future annual savings related to these plans to be in the range of 10 million to 15 million to be realized over the next three to five years there is no assurance that future savings will be fully achieved

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations 

business acquisitions   

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived assets 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinitelived assets might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the assets fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the assets carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the companys businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the companys discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the companys significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

annual goodwill impairment testing 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business the valuation date for annual impairment testing is april 30 a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill the company uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including future sales growth operating margin growth benefits from restructuring initiatives tax rates capital spending business initiatives and working capital changes these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved businessunit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions the company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting units fair value and the relative size of the companys recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the companys impairment analysis 

the performance of the companys 2012 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the companys goodwill the wacc rates utilized in the 2012 analysis ranged from 85 to 105 excluding the companys healthcare reporting unit discussed below if the fair value of each of the companys other reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5 at april 30 2012 the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed their net book value if the fair value of each of the companys reporting units been hypothetically reduced by 10 at april 30 2012 one reporting unit within the implantsendodonticshealthcarepacific rim segment would have a net book value exceeding its fair value by less than 10 million goodwill for this reporting unit totals 241 million had the wacc rate of each of the companys reporting units been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at april 30 2012 the fair value of all reporting units except for the companys healthcare reporting unit would still exceed their net book value the companys healthcare reporting unit a component of the implantsendodonticshealthcarepacific rim operating segment was created as a part of the astra tech acquisition on august 31 2011 at the date of acquisition the fair value of the business equaled book value with goodwill for the reporting unit totaling 2790 million given the limited 

time since the acquisition date the reporting unit fair value approximates the book value of the reporting unit 

should the companys analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value there can be no assurance that the companys future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges when no other point within the ranges are a better estimate of the probable loss the ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who consider information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has estimated liabilities for probable losses well in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred 

income taxes 

income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes the companys tax expense includes the us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested

certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely as of december 31 2012 the company recorded a valuation allowance of 1797 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 184 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 12 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

the company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance cash requirements including capital expenditures in a range of 120 million to 130 million stock repurchases debt service operating leases and potential future acquisitions from the current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities which is further discussed in note 10 financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements the company intends to finance the current portion of long term debt due in 2013 utilizing the available commercial paper and the revolving credit facilities as noted in the companys consolidated statements of cash flows in this form 10k the company continues to generate strong cash flows from operations which is used to finance the companys activities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the companys major market risk exposures are changing interest rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the company in its manufacturing processes the companys policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions the company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the companys exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies the companys policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss in order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed costs the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs which are difficult to reasonably predict and have therefore not been included below 

foreign exchange risk management 

the company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency the gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying nonfunctional currency balances the company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks 

the company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated company the company accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 

the company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates currently the company uses both nonderivative financial instruments including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and cross currency basis swaps to hedge some of this exposure translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the nonderivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments 

at december 31 2012 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against all other currencies would reduce the fair value asset associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately 77 million and reduce the fair value liability associated with the cross currency basis swaps by approximately 763 million 

interest rate risk management 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt and to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 the company has three groups of significant interest rate swaps one of the groups of swaps has notional amounts totaling 126 billion japanese yen and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed interest rate of 02 for a term of three years ending in september 2014 another swap has a notional amount of 650 million swiss francs and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate of 07 for a term of five years ending in september 2016 another swap has a notional amount of 1500 million to effectively convert the underlying fixed interest rate of 41 on a portion of the companys 2500 million private placement notes to variable rate for a term of five years ending february 2016 the interest rates on variable rate term loan debt and commercial paper are consistent with current market conditions therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying values 

at december 31 2012 an increase of 10 in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would increase the companys interest expense by approximately 62 million 

commodity risk management 

 the company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material costs these swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components used in the production of certain of the companys products the company generally accounts for the commodity swaps as cash flow hedges at december 31 2012 the company had swaps in place to purchase 758 troy ounces of platinum bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 1571 per troy ounce in addition the company had swaps in place to purchase 56712 troy ounces of silver bullion for use in production at an average fixed rate of 31 per troy ounce 

at december 31 2012 a 10 increase in commodity prices would reduce the fair value liability associated with the commodity swaps by approximately 03 million 

off balance sheet arrangements 

consignment arrangements 

the company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions under these consignment arrangements the banks own the precious metal and accordingly the company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period which typically run for a period of one to nine months however because the company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions the consignment agreements allow the company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer ie the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 

as precious metal prices fluctuate the company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation while the company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products for practical purposes if the precious metal 

prices go up or down by a small amount the company will not immediately modify prices as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal if there is a significant change in the price of precious metals the company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys maintaining its margin on the products 

at december 31 2012  the company had 186471 troy ounces of precious metal primarily gold platinum palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of 1298 million under the terms of the consignment agreements the company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory at december 31 2012  the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 053 these compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold

markets sales and distribution 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for its dental and healthcare products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental and healthcare products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental and health products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental and medical care in these markets dental care is increasingly focused upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as excavation of teeth and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination a broader segment of the population in these markets can afford higher end treatments in both dental and medical care 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to excavation of teeth and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental and medical care these markets demand diverse products and broader alternatives to address patient and professional needs however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive excellent dental and medical care similar to that received in developed countries as such our higher end products are actively sold into all of these regions 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to benefit from opportunities in virtually any market 

reference is made to the information about the companys foreign and domestic operations and export sales set forth in note 4 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

dental 

dentsply distributes approximately 56 of its dental products through distributors and importers however certain highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys dental ceramics crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials orthodontic appliances implants and bone substitute and grafting materials are sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets during 2011 2010 and 2009 one customer henry schein incorporated a dental distributor accounted for 11 of dentsplys consolidated net sales in each year no other single customer represented ten percent or more of dentsplys consolidated net sales during 2011 2010 or 2009 

although many of its dental sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools which are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach dentsply employs approximately 3650 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the distributors dealers and the endusers the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and end 

user marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the companys products 

healthcare 

the companys urology products business operates directly in 15 countries throughout europe and north america with distributors in 22 additional markets the largest markets include germany uk france and italy sales channels target urologists urology nurses general practitioners and directtopatients 

the surgery products business operates directly in 11 countries throughout europe and australia with distributors in 25 additional markets the largest markets include uk italy and australia sales channels target surgeons hospital nurses physiotherapists hospital purchasing departments and medical supply distributors

the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various medical associates professional and key opinion leaders to help promote our products although there are no assurances that they will continue to support the companys products in the future 

product development 

technological innovation and successful product development are critical to strengthening the companys prominent position in the healthcare and dental markets that it serves it is also required to maintain and grow its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high market share and to grow market share in other product categories while many of dentsplys existing products undergo evolutionary improvements the company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that represent fundamental change 

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and in select areas of healthcare as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions dental and medical schools the company directly invested 667 million 494 million and 503 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the companys strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry and in select areas in health care 

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions and by entering into licensing agreements with third parties as well as purchasing technologies developed by third parties 

acquisition activities 

dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of acquisition opportunities dentsply also seeks to expand its position in consumable medical device products through acquisitions in 2011 the company acquired astra tech ab a swedenbased provider of dental implants customized implant abutments and urology and surgery products from astrazeneca also in 2011 the company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of materialise dental nv in which it had acquired a minority interest in 2006 materialise dental operating out of leuven belgium offers planning and simulation software tools to dental professionals worldwide additionally in 2011 the company purchased a usbased developer and seller of dental lasers and a small distributor of dental specialty products and a small dental equipment manufacturer both located in europe 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to supplement the companys core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business including new technologies additional 

products and geographic breadth 

operating and technical expertise 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacturing process of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products the company continues to automate its global manufacturing operations in order to lower costs 

financing 

on august 31 2011 the company acquired astra tech in an all cash transaction for 18 billion issuing 12 billion of new debt and using 6245 million of available net cash resulting in a net decrease in cash and equivalents of 4629 million during the year ended december 31 2011 to 771 million as a result of the acquisition financing dentsplys total longterm debt including the current portion at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 14914 million and 6065 million respectively and the ratios of longterm debt including the current portion to total capitalization were 442 and 241 dentsply defines total capitalization as the sum of total longterm debt including the current portion plus total equity the companys longterm debt including the current portion increased by a net of 8849 million during the year ended december 31 2011 this net change included a net increase in longterm borrowings of 8769 million during the year ended 2011 plus an increase of 80 million due to exchange rate fluctuations on debt denominated in foreign currencies the companys shortterm debt including commercial paper of 2668 million increased by a net of 2700 million during the year ended december 31 2011 to 2753 million the company may incur additional debt in the future for funding needs including but not limited to funding additional acquisitions and capital expenditures 

additional information about dentsplys working capital liquidity and capital resources is provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k 

competition 

the company conducts its operations both domestic and foreign under highly competitive market conditions competition in the dental and healthcare products industries is based primarily upon product performance quality safety and ease of use as well as price customer service innovation and acceptance by professionals technicians and patients dentsply believes that its principal strengths include its wellestablished brand names its reputation for high quality and innovative products its leadership in product development and manufacturing its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the companys products by dental and healthcare professionals 

the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company 

regulation 

the companys products are subject to regulation by among other governmental entities the us food and drug administration the “fda” in general if a dental or medical “device” is subject to fda regulation compliance with the fdas requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations in order to ensure that dental and medical products distributed for human use in the us are safe and effective the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and sale of dental and medical products of the types produced by the company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with the fda and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations 

dental and medical devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices in the european union dentsplys products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply products in europe bear the ce mark showing that such products adhere to european regulations 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal 

lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks of dental amalgams the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institute of health and the us public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated in response to concerns raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam the fda formed an advisory committee in 2006 to review peerreviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam in july 2009 the fda concluded its review of dental amalgam confirming its use as a safe and effective restorative material also as a result of this review the fda classified amalgam and its component parts elemental mercury and powder alloy as a class ii medical device previously there was no classification for encapsulated amalgam and dental mercury class i and alloy class ii were classified separately this new regulation places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials including composite and gold fillings and makes amalgam subject to special controls by fda in that respect fda recommended that certain information about dental amalgam be provided which includes information indicating that dental amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor that studies on people age six and over and fda estimated exposures of children under six have not indicated any adverse health risk associated with the use of dental amalgam after the fda issued this regulation several petitions were filed asking the fda to reconsider its position another advisory panel was established by the fda to consider these petitions hearings of the advisory panel were held in december 2010 the fda has taken no action as of the filing date of this form 10k from this latest advisory panel meeting 

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use of amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

sources and supply of raw materials and finished goods 

the company manufactures the majority of the products sold by the company all of the raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources no single supplier accounts for a significant percentage of dentsplys raw material requirements in addition to those products both manufactured and sold by the company some finished goods products sold by the company are purchased from thirdparty suppliers of these finished goods products purchased from thirdparty suppliers a significant portion of the companys injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products dental cutting instruments catheters and nickel titanium products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers 

intellectual property 

products manufactured by dentsply are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names dentsply also owns and maintains more than 2500 patents throughout the world and is licensed under a small number of patents owned by others 

dentsplys policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations both in the us and in significant international markets the company carefully monitors trademark use worldwide and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company dentsply believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the companys marketing position but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 11800 employees a small percentage of the companys u s employees are represented by labor unions a facility in des plaines illinois is represented by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers aflcio under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on may 31 2012 additionally the companys ransom  randolph facility in maumee ohio is represented by local no 12 of the international union united automobile aerospace and agriculture implement workers of america under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on january 31 2017 in germany approximately 40 of degudent employees approximately 30 of friadent employees approximately 15 of vdw employees approximately 30 of detrey employees and in sweden approximately 60 of astra tech employees are represented by labor unions the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 

environmental matters 

dentsply believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations maintaining this level of compliance has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on the companys capital expenditures or on its business 

other factors affecting the business 

approximately twothirds of the companys sales are located in regions outside the us and the companys consolidated net sales can be impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the companys business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period sales for the industry and the company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

 the company maintains short lead times within its manufacturing as such the backlog on products is not material to the financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsplys business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

negative changes could occur in the dental markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which dentsply operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition many of the companys markets are affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs in certain markets particularly in the european union government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the companys results 

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the companys suppliers and customers and consumers which could harm the companys financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the companys supply chain and the customers and consumers of the companys products and may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the companys international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 

due to the international nature of dentsplys business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with approximately twothirds of the companys sales located in regions outside the us and the companys consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the companys ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

  

although the company continues to have positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the companys ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the companys businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that would not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

the companys quarterly operating results and market price for the companys common stock may be volatile 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the companys control including 

 10 

 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline the quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsplys common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not necessarily limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the companys industry and competitors the companys financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsplys common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the companys common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could harm the companys business 

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

the worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsplys competitors may have greater resources than the company 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

the market for dentsplys products is characterized by rapid and significant technological change evolving industry standards and new product introductions there can be no assurance that dentsplys products will not become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the companys investment in product development if the companys products or technologies become noncompetitive or obsolete dentsplys business could be negatively affected 

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable us or international government or regulatory authorities or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors new products will not be introduced that could render the companys products obsolete 

  

the company may fail to comply with applicable government regulations 

the company must obtain certain approvals and marketing clearances from governmental authorities including the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell its products these regulatory agencies regulate the marketing manufacturing labeling packaging advertising sale and distribution of medical devices 

the regulatory review process which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device may delay or hinder a products timely entry into the marketplace moreover there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the fda or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion if at all or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect the company the fda also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received fda clearance failure to comply with the fdas advertising guidelines may result in the withdrawal of products or imposition of penalties 

dentsplys business operations are also subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda and other domestic government authorities and similar foreign authorities to monitor dentsplys compliance with the regulations administered by such authorities there can be no assurance that these authorities will not raise compliance concerns failure to satisfy any such requirements can result in governmental enforcement actions including possible product seizure injunction andor criminal or civil proceedings 

challenges may be asserted against the companys dental amalgam product 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury   some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content andor that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale andor disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the companys sales of dental amalgam dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

a significant portion of the companys injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products dental cutting instruments catheters nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers some of which may also compete with the company as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the companys products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products in addition these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the company at any time dentsply may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the companys ability to deliver products to customers if the company is unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner or if the company encounters delays or other difficulties in the supply of such products and other materials from third parties the companys business and results of operation may be harmed 

the company has lost and continues to lose customers of its orthodontics business due to the disruption in its ability to source certain orthodontic products from its key supplier located in japans evacuation area 

  

one of the companys key suppliers which was the source of certain orthodontic products comprising approximately 9 of the companys 2010 consolidated net sales excluding precious metal content is located in the zone that was evacuated following the march 2011 tsunami in japan the supplier lost access to its facility and as a result supply was severely disrupted through the remainder of 2011 and is expected to only gradually return to a normal level over the coming quarters during 2012 although the company has secured limited alternative sources of supply there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure sufficient alternate supplies or that the companys customers will convert to such alternate products or sources nor is there any assurance that customers who turn to other sources of products during the companys period of product shortages will return to the companys products once the companys key supplier has resumed full production capacity andor the company has secured an acceptable alternative source of supply 

the companys expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert managements attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

the company may fail to successfully integrate astra tech or realize the benefits of the acquisition 

the success of the companys acquisition of astra tech depends upon its ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating astra techs business into its operations prior to the completion of the acquisition the company was permitted to undertake only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies the companys ongoing business could be disrupted and managements attention diverted due to integration planning activities and as a result of the actual integration of the two companies following the acquisition the company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration on a timely basis or at all for a variety of reasons including but not limited to the following 

 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures it is possible that future accounting standards the company would be required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment applied to the companys consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

if the companys goodwill or intangible assets become impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap the company reviews its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill or intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates net sales growth discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows are critical assumptions used to determine these fair values slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flows among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the companys goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the companys goodwill or intangible assets is determined 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules structures country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the companys effective tax rates 

the company is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions unanticipated changes in the companys tax rates could affect its future results of operations the companys future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company 

does business by structural changes in the companys businesses by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit or by changes in the valuation of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the companys business involves a risk of product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the companys products the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company 

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the companys products infringe upon such partys intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products 

increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe 

we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of dentsplys revenue operating in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees  

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsplys ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertains to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered 

after closing the astra tech acquisition dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness a breach of the covenants under dentsplys debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement 

in connection with the financing of the acquisition of astra tech the company incurred additional debt of approximately 12 billion as a consequence after closing the acquisition dentsply has a significant amount of indebtedness dentsply also has the ability to incur up to 500 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future 

dentsplys level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

dentsplys current indebtedness contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy under the agreements governing the dentsplys 411 senior notes due 2016 the company is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda of less than or equal to 400 to 100 until september 30 2012 following such period dentsply will be required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda of less than or equal to 350 to 100 the company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratio but no assurance can be given that dentsply will be able to do so dentsplys failure to maintain such ratio or a breach of the other covenants under its debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies 

certain provisions in the companys governing documents may make it more difficult for third party offerors to acquire dentsply 

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include among others the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply 

issues related to the quality and safety of the companys products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall resulting in harm to the companys reputation and negatively impacting the companys operating results 

the companys products generally maintain a good reputation with customers and endusers issues related to quality and safety of products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize the companys image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for the companys products or cause production and delivery disruptions the company may need to recall products if they become unfit for use in addition the company could potentially be subject to litigation or government action which could result in payment of fines or damages cost associated with these potential actions could negatively affect the companys operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks and any disruption to its technology infrastructure or the internet could harm the companys operations 

dentsply operates many aspects of its business including financial reporting and customer relationship management through server and webbased technologies and stores various types of data on such servers or with thirdparties who may in turn store it on servers or in the “cloud” any disruption to the internet or to the companys or its service providers global technology infrastructure including malware insecure coding “acts of god” attempts to penetrate networks data leakage and human error could pose a threat to the companys operations while dentsply has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the companys operations and financial results

significant developments in 2011 

 

 

 

business 

dentsply international inc is a leading manufacturer and distributor of dental and other healthcare products the company believes it is the worlds largest manufacturer of professional dental products for over 110 years dentsplys commitment to innovation and professional collaboration has enhanced its portfolio of branded consumables and small equipment headquartered in the united states the company has global operations with sales in more than 120 countries the company also has strategically located distribution centers to enable it to better serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency while the united states and europe are the companys largest markets the company serves all major markets worldwide 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal growth by geographic region 2 constant currency growth by geographic region 3 operating margins of each reportable segment including product pricing and cost controls 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products and 5 growth through acquisition 

the company defines “internal growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious 

metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 net acquisition growth the company defines “net acquisition growth” as the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months following the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired less the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months prior to the transaction date of businesses that have been divested the company defines “constant currency growth” as internal growth plus net acquisition growth 

management believes that an average internal growth rate of 4 to 6 is a longterm targeted rate for the company the internal growth rate may vary outside of this range based on weaker or stronger economic conditions management believes the company may operate slightly below this range in 2012 due to current global economic conditions historical trends show that growth in the dental industry generally performs better than the overall economy however it typically lags the economic trend going into and coming out of slower growth or recessionary periods there can be no assurance that the companys assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets or the general dental market will continue in the future if such rates are less than expected the companys projected growth rates and results of operations may be adversely affected 

price changes other marketing and promotional programs offered to customers from time to time the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales and inventory levels in a given period 

the company has always maintained a focus on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions to reduce costs in addition the company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives the company believes that the benefits from these initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance 

product innovation is a key component of the companys overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

the company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the companys product offerings through acquisitions although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the company operates has experienced consolidation it is still a fragmented industry management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future however it will be very focused in the nearterm on the integration of its recent acquisition of astra tech 

impact of the natural disaster in japan 

on march 11 2011 the country of japan experienced an unprecedented natural disaster which significantly impacted a key supplier of the company and the general dental and medical markets within japan the specific business interruption caused by a key supplier in japan has caused the loss of both sales and earnings for the company during 2011 which may take multiple years to recover 

the companys net sales in japan represent approximately 4 of the companys consolidated 2010 net sales excluding precious metal content and are reported as part of the “france united kingdom italy and certain other european countries cis middle east africa pacific rim businesses” operating segment the nearterm economic conditions in japan have been negatively impacted by the physical and economic complications of the disaster these factors resulted in lower demand for some of our products however we believe this will have little impact on our business in 2012 

 one of the companys key suppliers which is the source of certain orthodontic products which comprised approximately 9 of the companys consolidated annual net sales excluding precious metal content in 2010 was located within the evacuation zone in japan and has since relocated its operations to a location outside of the evacuation zone while the supplier resumed partial delivery of products during the second half of 2011 the company does not expect a return to normal supply levels until midyear 2012 also to help lessen the impact the company made temporary arrangements for limited alternative supply of certain products and has made certain restructuring actions to manage the cost structure of the orthodontic business the companys efforts in restructuring along with finding limited alternative supply arrangements as well as partial resumption of products helped mitigate some of the negative impact from the shortage of supply during 2011 the impact in 2011 was approximately 015 per diluted share the orthodontic products impacted by this situation are primarily sold and reported as part of the “canadalatin americaendodonticsorthodonticsastra tech” operating segment given that the company does not manufacture these products 

generally the operating margins are lower than the companys overall operating margins 

   the companys estimate of the potential negative impact in 2012 compared to 2011 is based on assumptions regarding the continued sourcing of limited alternative supply the timing and success of the key suppliers resumption of full operations at an alternative site the ability to successfully reduce the cost structure of the business during the supply disruption customer acceptance of alternatively supplied products and the companys ability to achieve success in its sales and marketing strategies once supply resumes while the company expects shipments of certain orthodontic products from the japanese supplier during the first half of 2012 a full return to manufacturing capacity is not expected until midyear 2012 the company expects that the impact of the supply disruption was greatest in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 the impact is expected to get sequentially better compared to the prior year beginning in the second quarter of 2012 however it will continue to result in negative year over year comparisons until the third quarter of 2012 

impact of foreign currencies 

due to the international nature of dentsplys business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with over 65 of the companys sales located in regions outside the us the companys consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

impact of european sovereign debt crisis on the business 

the company continues to monitor the changing economic landscape as a result of the sovereign debt and liquidity crisis in certain countries located primarily in europe the crisis may impact certain customers ability to timely pay for products and services approximately 45 of the companys sales are located in europe primarily to nongovernmental entities the company believes no additional allowances or reserves are required for open receivable positions as of december 31 2011 beyond what has already been recorded as the company has noted no material change in payment practices of customers if the outcome of the crisis is detrimental to our customers ability to continue to make timely payments the company will assess the need for additional reserves which could impact the companys ability to recognize revenue or result in discontinuing sales to certain customers further economic decline as the result of austerity measures taken or proposed to be taken by european governments may have a detrimental affect on customers and could result in lower levels of demand for the companys products the negative impact of these potential outcomes could materially impact the company results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior years data in order to conform to current year presentation 

results of operations 

2011 compared to 2010 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency which includes internal growth and acquisition growth and 2 foreign currency translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified below the accounting estimates believed to be critical to its business and results of operations

business acquisitions   

the company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill the assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations 

the company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values examples of factors and information that the company uses to determine the fair values include tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information if the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred the company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the assets fair value is 

determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the assets carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment

although many of its sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools who are the endusers of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach dentsply employs approximately 2800 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the distributors dealers and the endusers the company conducts extensive distributor dealer and enduser marketing programs additionally the company trains laboratory technicians dental hygienists dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses located throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the company’s products 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental care in these markets dental care is increasingly focused upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as excavation of teeth and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to excavation of teeth and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental care these markets demand diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces restorative compounds finishing devices custom restorative devices basic surgical instruments bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive excellent dental care similar to that received in developed countries and expect to receive the best dental care available 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves 

the company believes that the market for its products will grow over the longterm based on the following factors

product development 

technological innovation and successful product development are critical to strengthening the company’s prominent position in worldwide dental markets maintaining its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high market share and increasing market share in product categories where gains are possible while many of dentsply’s existing products undergo evolutionary improvements the company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that represent fundamental change 

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with external research institutions and dental schools through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions and dental schools the company directly invested 494 million 503 million and 485 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the companys strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry the yearoveryear comparisons for 2010 versus 2009 and 2009 versus 2008 were both impacted by foreign currency translation which decreased the reported expense variations 

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions by entering into licensing agreements and by purchasing technologies developed by third parties 

acquisition activities 

dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of acquisition opportunities in 2010 the company purchased an initial ownership interest of 16 of the outstanding shares in dio corporation “dio” a korean manufacturer of dental implants and various other dental devices and materials additionally in 2010 the company purchased several small distributors of dental specialty products and a small dental equipment manufacturer these businesses are located in europe and in asia 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to supplement the companys core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business including new technologies additional products and geographic breadth 

operating and technical expertise 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacturing process of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products the company continues to automate its global manufacturing operations in order to lower costs

competition

 5  

  

the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company 

  regulation 

the companys products are subject to regulation by among other governmental entities the us food and drug administration the “fda” in general if a dental “device” is subject to fda regulation compliance with the fdas requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations in order to ensure that dental products distributed for human use in the us are safe and effective the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and sale of dental products of the types produced by the company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with the fda and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations 

dental devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices in the european union dentsplys products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply products in europe bear the ce mark showing that such products adhere to the european regulations 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks of dental amalgams the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institutes of health and the us public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated in response to concerns raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam the fda formed an advisory committee in 2006 to review peerreviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam in july 2009 the fda concluded its review of dental amalgam confirming its use as a safe and effective restorative material also as a result of this review the fda classified amalgam and its component parts elemental mercury and powder alloy as a class ii medical device previously there was no classification for encapsulated amalgam and dental mercury class i and alloy class ii were classified separately this new regulation places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials including composite and gold fillings after the fda issued this regulation several petitions were filed asking the fda to reconsider its position another advisory panel was established by the fda to consider these petitions hearings of the advisory panel were held in december 2010 the fda has taken no action as of the filing date of this form 10k from this latest advisory panel meeting 

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use for amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

sources and supply of raw materials and finished goods 

the company manufactures the majority of the products sold by the company all of the raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources no single supplier accounts for a significant percentage of dentsplys raw material requirements in addition to those products both manufactured and sold by the company some finished goods products sold by the company are purchased from third party suppliers of these finished goods products purchased from third party suppliers a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products and dental cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers

intellectual property 

products manufactured by dentsply are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names dentsply also owns and maintains more than 2000 patents throughout the world and is licensed under a small number of patents owned by others 

dentsplys policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations in the us and in significant international markets for its products the company carefully monitors trademark use worldwide and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company dentsply believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the companys marketing position but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark 

employees

environmental matters 

dentsply believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations maintaining this level of compliance has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on the companys capital expenditures or on its business 

other factors affecting the business 

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year price changes other marketing and promotional programs as well as the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period sales for the industry and the company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply’s business financial condition or future results the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate its relative importance or priority 

negative changes could occur in the dental markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which dentsply operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition many of the companys markets are affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs in certain markets particularly in the european union government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the companys results 

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the company’s suppliers customers and consumers which could harm the company’s financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

dentsply with its significant international operations is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates of various foreign currencies and other risks associated with foreign trade the impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be favorable or unfavorable the company’s balance sheet includes debt and net investment hedges that are sensitive to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the company’s ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital 

although the company has had continued positive operating cash flow a disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to the company the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when required by the company the cost of or lack of available credit could impact the company’s ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow the company which in turn may adversely affect the company’s businesses and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that will not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

the company may not be able to access or renew its precious metal consignment facilities resulting in a liquidity constraint equal to the fair market value of the precious metal value of inventory and would subject the company to inventory valuation risk as the value of the precious metal inventory fluctuates resulting in greater volatility to reported earnings 

  

 8  

  

the company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the company’s common stock may be volatile 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors many of which are substantially outside of the company’s control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result the company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline the quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not necessarily limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas the company does business 

also the nasdaq national market “nasdaq” can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm the company’s business 

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims 

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other types of legal actions or claims including possible recall actions affecting the company’s products the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost also other types of claims asserted against the company may not be covered by insurance a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company

increasing exposure to markets outside of the us and europe 

we anticipate that sales outside of the us and europe will continue to account for a significant portion of dentsply’s revenue operating in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 11  

  

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees  

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

dentsplys ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although senior management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents may discourage third party offers to acquire dentsply that might otherwise result in the company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include among others the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply 

issues related to the quality and safety of the company’s products ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall resulting in harm to the company’s reputation and negatively impacting the company’s operating results 

the company’s products generally maintain a good reputation with customers and endusers issues related to quality and safety of products ingredients or packaging could jeopardize the company’s image and reputation negative publicity related to these types of concerns whether valid or not might negatively impact demand for the company’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions the company may need to recall products if they become unfit for use in addition the company could potentially be subject to litigation or government action which could result in payment of fines or damages cost associated with these potential actions could negatively affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity

business 

dentsply international inc believes it is the worlds largest designer developer manufacturer and marketer of professional dental products the company is headquartered in the united states and operates in more than 120 other countries principally through its foreign subsidiaries the company also has strategically located distribution centers to enable it to better serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency while the united states and europe are the companys largest markets the company serves all of the major professional dental markets worldwide 

principal measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal growth by geographic region 2 constant currency growth by geographic region 3 operating margins of each reportable segment including product pricing and cost controls 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products and 5 growth through acquisition 

the company defines “internal growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 net acquisition growth the company defines “net acquisition growth” as the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months following the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired less the net sales excluding precious metal content for a period of twelve months prior to the transaction date of businesses that have been divested the company defines “constant currency growth” as internal growth plus net acquisition growth 

management believes that an average internal growth rate of 4 to 6 is a longterm targeted rate for the company the internal growth rate may vary outside of this range based on weaker or stronger economic conditions management expects the company to operate below this range in 2011 due to the current economic conditions historical trends show that growth in the dental industry generally performs better than the overall economy however it typically lags the economic trend going into and coming out of slower growth or recessionary periods there can be no assurance that the company’s assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets or the general dental market will continue in the future if such rates are less than expected the company’s projected growth rates and results of operations may be adversely affected 

price changes other marketing and promotional programs offered to customers from time to time the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales and inventory levels in a given period 

the company has always maintained a focus on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions to reduce the cost in addition the company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives the company believes that the benefits from these initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance 

  

 25  

  

product innovation is a key component of the companys overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

although the professional dental market in which the company operates has experienced consolidation it is still a fragmented industry the company continues to focus on opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings through acquisitions management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future 

impact of foreign currencies 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with over 60 of the company’s sales located in regions outside the us the company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the us dollar additionally movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the company’s gross profit certain operating expenses interest expense interest income other expense and other income as well as the assets and liabilities 

reclassification of prior year amounts 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior years data in order to conform to current year presentation 

results of operations 

2010 compared to 2009 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency which includes internal growth and acquisition growth and 2 foreign currency translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely a passthrough to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies 

 

  

 26  

  

the 21 increase in net sales excluding precious metal content included constant currency growth of 26 offset by currency translation which reduced net sales excluding precious metal content by 05 the constant currency sales growth was comprised of internal growth of 21 and acquisition growth of 05 

constant currency sales growth 

the following table includes growth rates for net sales excluding precious metal content 

 

 

united states 

during 2010 net sales excluding precious metal content were slightly positive at 01 in the u s on a constant currency and internal growth basis growth in dental specialty and dental consumable sundry products along with a strong recovery in nondental sales were offset by lower sales in dental laboratory and dental consumable small equipment products 

europe 

during 2010 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 37 in europe on a constant currency basis including 29 internal growth and acquisition growth of 08 internal sales growth was primarily driven by growth in the dental consumables dental specialty and nondental products and a business recovery in the cis markets which experienced customer liquidity constraints during 2009 these gains were partially offset by lower sales in the dental laboratory products 

all other regions 

during 2010 net sales excluding precious metal content increased 47 across all other regions on a constant currency basis including 41 internal growth and acquisition growth of 06 internal sales growth was driven primarily by growth in dental specialty products as well as increases for dental consumable and nondental products 

gross profit 

 

  

 27  

  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content was flat during 2010 compared to 2009 product price increases and cost containment across the company’s product distribution function were offset by unfavorable product mix and negative foreign currency movements 

expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses 

 

the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to new investments in certain businesses increased spending in support of new product introductions reinstatement of annual salary increases and increases in certain discretionary spending categories such as travel expenses partially offset by benefits from expense reductions in other areas of the business the company continues to maintain its focus on reducing costs and achieving operational efficiencies through the consolidation of operations or functions where opportunities exist 

restructuring and other costs 

 

nm not meaningful 

the company recorded net restructuring and other costs of 110 million in 2010 compared to 69 million in 2009 the company incurred 58 million of costs related to several restructuring plans these costs consist of employee severance benefits payments due under operating contracts and other restructuring costs the restructuring plans related to the continued effort to streamline the company’s operations to better leverage the company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining operational efficiencies additionally the company recorded certain other costs of 52 million of which 37 million was related to legal matters 

in 2009 the company incurred 59 million of costs related to several restructuring plans in response to the worldwide economic crisis that began in late 2008 the restructuring plans related to the closure andor consolidation of certain production and selling facilities in the united states europe and south america to better leverage the company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining operational efficiencies additionally the company executed targeted reductions in workforce both in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business functions in certain locations also the company recorded certain other costs related to legal matters and an impairment of an intangible asset 

other income and expenses 

 

  

 28  

  

net interest expense 

the change in net interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 for the year ended december 31 was mainly the result of higher average debt levels in the us and lower cash levels due as a result of stock repurchases and investments in acquisitions combined with weaker average euro exchange and lower average euro interest rates on higher average euro cash balances interest income decreased 07 million on lower average interest rates on euro investment balances which were 50 basis points lower in the current year than the prior year and the us dollar was 7 stronger against the euro interest expense increased 32 million on higher average debt partially offset by lower interest rate difference on net investment hedges the impact of the company’s net investment hedges typically move in the opposite direction of currency movements reducing some of the volatility caused by movement in exchange rates on the company’s income and equity 

other expense net 

other expense in the 2010 period included approximately 33 million of currency transaction losses and 15 million of other nonoperating income the 2009 period included 03 million of currency transaction losses and 07 million of other nonoperating costs 

income taxes and net income 

 

 

income taxes 

the company’s effective income tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 250 and 245 respectively in 2010 the company’s effective income tax rate included the impact of restructuring and other costs acquisition related activity provisions for a credit risk adjustment to outstanding derivatives and various income tax adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by 149 million and 33 million respectively in 2009 the company’s effective income tax rate included the impact of restructuring and other costs acquisition related activity and various income tax adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by 110 million and 88 million respectively in 2009 various income tax adjustments included the impact of settlements with taxing authorities and statutes closures 

equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliated company 

the company’s 16 ownership investment of dio corporation on december 9 2010 resulted in a net loss of 11 million on an aftertax basis for 2010 the net loss of dio was the result of marktomarket charges related to the derivative accounting for the convertible bonds issued by dio to dentsply the company’s portion of the marktomarket net loss incurred by dio was approximately 11 million 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

the portion of consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 14 million from 2009 to 2010 the increase is primarily attributable to the strengthening performance of the company’s zhermack division where the company has had a 60 ownership investment since december 2008 

  

 29  

  

net income attributable to dentsply international 

in addition to the results reported in accordance with us gaap the company provides adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international and adjusted earnings per diluted common share these adjusted amounts consist of us gaap amounts excluding 1 restructuring and other costs 2 acquisition related charges 3 loss on a derivative at an unconsolidated affiliated company 4 income tax related adjustments and 5 credit risk adjustment to outstanding derivatives adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international by diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with us gaap and therefore are nonus gaap measures these nonus gaap measures may differ from other companies 

the company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to dentsply international and adjusted earnings per diluted common share provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the company’s financial condition and results of operations the nonus gaap financial information should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 

 

 

operating segment results 

 

the company’s operating businesses are combined into operating groups which have overlapping product offerings geographic presence customer bases distribution channels and regulatory oversight these operating groups are considered the company’s reportable segments as the company’s chief operating decisionmaker regularly reviews financial results at the operating group level and uses this information to manage the company’s operations each of these operating groups covers a wide range of product categories and geographic regions the product categories and geographic regions often overlap across the groups further information regarding the details of each group is presented in note 4 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements the management of each group is evaluated for performance and incentive compensation purposes on net third party sales excluding precious metal content and segment operating income

critical accounting judgments and policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial techniques the company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates the company has identified below the accounting estimates believed to be critical to its business and results of operations 

accounts receivable 

the company sells dental products both through a worldwide network of distributors and directly to end users for customers on credit terms the company performs an ongoing credit evaluation of those customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral from them the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to improve or deteriorate their ability to make required payments may become less or more impaired and decreases or increases in these allowances may be required in addition a negative impact on sales to those customers may occur 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost of inventories is determined primarily by the firstin firstout “fifo” or average cost methods with a small portion being determined by the last in firstout “lifo” method the company establishes reserves for inventory estimated to be obsolete or unmarketable equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated additional inventory reserves may be required 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill which requires an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified as a result of impairment tests the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill 

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value 

  

 38  

  

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

substantially all of the employees of the company and its subsidiaries are covered by government or companysponsored defined benefit or defined contribution plans additionally certain union and salaried employee groups in the us are covered by postretirement healthcare plans costs for companysponsored plans are based on expected return on plan assets discount rates employee compensation increase rates and health care cost trends expected return on plan assets discount rates and health care cost trend assumptions are particularly important when determining the company’s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits changes in these assumptions can impact the company’s income before income taxes in determining the cost of postretirement benefits certain assumptions are established annually to reflect market conditions and plan experience to appropriately reflect the expected costs as actuarially determined these assumptions include medical inflation trend rates discount rates employee turnover and mortality rates in establishing its discount rates the company predominantly uses observed indices of highgrade corporate bond yields with durations that are equivalent to the expected duration of the underlying liability the discount rate for each plan is based on observed corporate bond yield indices in the respective economic region covered by the plan the expected return on plan assets is the weighted average longterm expected return based upon asset allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are invested principally in foreign locations additional information related to the impact of changes in these assumptions is provided in note 13 benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges the ranges established by management are based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who considers information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has estimated liabilities for probable losses well in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred 

accruals for product returns customer rebates and product warranties 

the company makes provisions for customer returns customer rebates and for product warranties at the time of sale these accruals are based on past history projections of customer purchases and sales and expected product performance in the future because the actual results for product returns rebates and warranties are dependent in part on future events these matters require the use of estimates the company has a long history of product performance in the dental industry and thus has an extensive knowledge base from which to draw in measuring these estimates 

income taxes

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures for dental care in these markets the focus of dental care is increasingly upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as the excavation and filling of cavities tooth extraction and denture replacement dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to the excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental care these markets demand diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces restorative compounds finishing devices custom restorative devices basic surgical instruments bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures however there is also a portion of the population in these markets that receive excellent dental care similar to that received in developed countries and expect to receive the best dental care available 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

regulation 

the companys products are subject to regulation by among other governmental entities the us food and drug administration the “fda” in general if a dental “device” is subject to fda regulation compliance with the fdas requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations in order to ensure that dental products distributed for human use in the us are safe and effective the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and sale of dental products of the types produced by the company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with the fda and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations 

dental devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices in the european union dentsplys products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply products in europe bear the ce mark showing that such products adhere to the european regulations 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks of dental amalgams the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institutes of health and the us public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated in response to concerns raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam the fda formed an advisory committee in 2006 to review peerreviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam in july 2009 the fda concluded its review of dental amalgam confirming its use as a safe and effective restorative material also as a result of this review the fda classified amalgam and its component parts elemental mercury and powder alloy as a class ii medical device previously there was no classification for encapsulated amalgam and dental mercury class i and alloy class ii were classified separately this new regulation places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials including composite and gold fillings 

in europe particularly in scandinavia and germany the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use for amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age additionally some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in sweden and severely curtailed in norway dentsply also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury 

sources and supply of raw materials and finished goods 

the company manufactures the majority of the products sold by the company all of the raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources no single supplier accounts for a significant percentage of dentsplys raw material requirements in addition to those products both manufactured and sold by the company some finished goods products sold by the company are purchased from third party suppliers of these finished goods products purchased from third party suppliers a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products and dental cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers 

intellectual property

negative changes could occur in the dental markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates

prolonged negative economic conditions in domestic and global markets may adversely affect the company’s suppliers customers and consumers which could harm the company’s financial position 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit the company’s ability to access capital or could raise the cost of capital

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

the worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsplys competitors may have greater resources than does the company

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation

various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to pay damages andor discontinue the sale of certain products

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents may discourage third party offers to acquire dentsply that might otherwise result in the company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 4 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply

key measurements 

the principal measurements used by the company in evaluating its business are 1 internal growth by geographic region 2 constant currency growth by geographic region 3 operating margins of each reportable segment 4 the development introduction and contribution of innovative new products 5 growth through acquisition and 6 continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency 

 

the company defines “internal growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding 1 precious metal content 2 the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and 3 the net sales for a period of twelve months following the transaction date of businesses that have been acquired or divested the company defines “constant currency growth” as internal growth plus acquisition growth 

 

management believes that an average internal growth rate of 46 is a longterm sustainable rate for the company the internal growth rate may vary outside of this range based on weaker or stronger economic conditions management expects the company to operate below this range in the near future due to the current economic conditions however history shows that growth in the dental industry typically performs better than the overall economy there can be no assurance that the company’s assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets or the dental market generally will continue in the future if such rates are less than expected the company’s projected growth rates and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

product innovation is a key component of the companys overall growth strategy new advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry as a result the company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support this technological development including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools in addition the company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties although the company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental products they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed 

 

although the professional dental market in which the company operates has experienced consolidation it is still a fragmented industry the company continues to focus on opportunities to expand the company’s product offerings through acquisitions management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future

company’s response to economic conditions 

price changes other marketing and promotional programs offered to customers from time to time the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales and inventory levels in a given period due to the current economic conditions the overall dental market has been negatively impacted by inventory reductions in its distribution channels particularly in certain emerging market regions 

additionally the current conditions of the economy have negatively impacted the company’s gross profit rate unfavorable product and geographic sales mix unfavorable overhead absorption and movements in foreign currencies are the key factors that have recently affected the company’s gross profits the company continues to manage these negative factors to help minimize their impact on the company’s overall performance 

due to the international nature of dentsply’s business movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations with over 60 of the company’s sales located in regions outside the us the company’s sales are significantly impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as discussed further under the segment descriptions the company was negatively impacted by the movements in currencies in 2009 

 

the company has always maintained its focus on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies in response to the recent credit crisis and the recessionary economic conditions management is concentrating on cost containment that focuses the business on creating and maintaining operational and financial flexibility through controlling operating costs management will continue to evaluate the consolidation of operations or functions and reduce the cost of those operations and functions in addition the company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives the company believes that the benefits from these initiatives will improve the cost structure and help offset areas of rising costs such as energy employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance 

in response to the recent economic conditions the company initiated several restructuring plans that included targeted headcount reductions and business consolidations and reorganizations in late 2008 through 2009 the company began to realize the cost savings associated with these restructuring plans in 2009 and expects to realize incremental cost savings associated with these restructuring plans in 2010 see note 14 restructuring impairments and other costs to the consolidated financial statements

2009 compared to 2008 

net sales 

the discussion below summarizes the company’s sales growth excluding precious metal content into the following components 1 constant currency which includes internal growth and acquisition growth and 2 foreign currency translation these disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods 

management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of dentsply’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the company’s precious metal dental alloy products which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the company’s sales is largely a passthrough to customers and has minimal effect on earnings dentsply reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods the company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers the company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change 

the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with us gaap and is therefore considered a nonus gaap measure the company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious metal content the company’s definitions and calculations of net sales excluding precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill 

the company follows the accounting standards for goodwill which requires an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach in addition to minimum annual impairment tests the company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired if impairment related to goodwill is identified as a result of impairment tests the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill

other longlived assets 

other longlived assets such as definitelived intangible assets and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with us gaap these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows if impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value 

impairment assessment 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized if there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions particularly changes in the company’s discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows the company may be required to recognize impairment charges if the overall global economy continues to experience recessionary conditions the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges being recognized information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other longlived assets are included in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements

substantially all of the employees of the company and its subsidiaries are covered by government or companysponsored defined benefit or defined contribution plans additionally certain union and salaried employee groups in the us are covered by postretirement healthcare plans costs for companysponsored plans are based on expected return on plan assets discount rates employee compensation increase rates and health care cost trends expected return on plan assets discount rates and health care cost trend assumptions are particularly important when determining the company’s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits changes in these assumptions can impact the company’s pretax earnings in determining the cost of postretirement benefits certain assumptions are established annually to reflect market conditions and plan experience to appropriately reflect the expected costs as actuarially determined these assumptions include medical inflation trend rates discount rates employee turnover and mortality rates in establishing its discount rates the company predominantly uses observed indices of highgrade corporate bond yields with durations that are equivalent to the expected duration of the underlying liability the discount rate for each plan is based on observed corporate bond yield indices in the respective economic region covered by the plan the expected return on plan assets is the weighted average longterm expected return based upon asset allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are invested principally in foreign locations additional information related to the impact of changes in these assumptions is provided in note 13 benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 

litigation 

the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations the company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are typically in the form of ranges and the company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges the ranges established by management are based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who considers information known at the time if the company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose any material potential liability these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment the company believes it has estimated liabilities for probable losses well in the past however the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred

accruals for product returns customer rebates and product warranties 

the company makes provisions for customer returns customer rebates and for product warranties at the time of sale these accruals are based on past history projections of customer purchases and sales and expected product performance in the future because the actual results for product returns rebates and warranties are dependent in part on future events these matters require the use of estimates the company has a long history of product performance in the dental industry and thus has an extensive knowledge base from which to draw in measuring these estimates

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

 

the us canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures on dental care in these markets the focus of dental care is increasingly upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as the excavation and filling of cavities and tooth extraction and denture replacement dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination 

 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to the excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental care these markets demand diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces restorative compounds finishing devices custom restorative devices basic surgical instruments bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures 

 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

 item 1a risk factors 

 

following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply’s business the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate its relative importance or priority 

 

negative changes could occur in the dental markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

 

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which it operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition many of the companys markets are affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs in certain markets government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the companys results 

 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions may affect the company’s suppliers customers and consumers which could harm the company’s financial position 

 

prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

 

due to the company’s international operations the company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

 

dentsply with its significant international operations is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates of various foreign currencies and other risks associated with foreign trade and the impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be favorable or unfavorable the company’s balance sheet includes debt and net investment hedges that are sensitive to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company’s statement of income 

 

volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit our ability to access capital 

    

although the company has had continued solid operating cash flow the disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to us the company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing andor future credit agreements and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner or at all when the company requires it the cost of or lack of available credit could impact our ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow our business which in turn may adversely affect the company’s businesses and results of operations 

 

the company also manages cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments through various institutions there may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that will not allow the company to recover the full principal of its investments 

 

the market price for the company’s common stock may be volatile 

 

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result the company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the fourth quarter or beginning of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding the first and third quarters but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

 

in addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not necessarily limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas the company does business 

 

 8  

 

 

 

also the nasdaq national market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm the company’s business 

 

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

 

the worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsplys competitors may have greater resources than does the company 

 

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

 

  dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the companys products obsolete 

 

the company may fail to comply with regulations issued by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies 

 

dentsplys business is subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda and similar foreign authorities to monitor dentsplys compliance with the regulations administered by such authorities there can be no assurance that these authorities will not raise compliance concerns failure to satisfy any such requirements can result in governmental enforcement actions including possible product seizure injunction andor criminal or civil proceedings 

 

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institutes of health and the us public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated if the fda were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam filling materials as classes of products requiring fda premarket approval there can be no assurance that the required approval would be obtained or that the fda would permit the continued sale of amalgam filling materials pending its determination 

 

also some groups have asserted that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment if governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the disposal of dental amalgam that could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales of dental amalgam 

 

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

 

a significant portion of the company’s injectible anesthetic products orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products in the future 

 

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on the company’s reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported activity 

 

  the company’s accounting principles have recently been changed by changes in the accounting principles for accounting for business combinations and related goodwill in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “sfas 141r” “business combinations” which changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination the recognition of contingent consideration the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies the recognition of capitalized inprocess research and development the accounting for acquisition related restructuring liabilities the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance sfas 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas 141r will change the company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009 

 

if the company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

 

under us gaap the company reviews its goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in market capitalization or future cash flows and slower growth rates in the dental industry the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the company’s financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on the company’s results of operations 

 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules structures country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the company’s effective tax rates 

 

the company is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions unanticipated changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results of operations the company’s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company does business structural changes in the company’s businesses by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit or by changes in the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation 

 

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time the company is named as a defendant in these cases the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business and overall cash flows of the company various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to discontinue the sale of certain products 

 

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees  

 

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

 10  

 

 

the company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

 

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

 

dentsplys ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

 

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

 

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered 

 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents may discourage third party offers to acquire dentsply that might otherwise result in the company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

 

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 5 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply

although many of its sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools who are the end users of its products as part of this enduser “pull through” marketing approach dentsply employs approximately 2100 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the dealers and the end 

 

 

users the company conducts extensive distributor and enduser marketing programs and trains laboratory technicians and dentists in the proper use of its products introducing them to the latest technological developments at its educational centers located throughout the world the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the company’s products 

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

the united states canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures on dental care in these markets the focus of dental care is increasingly upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as the excavation and filling of cavities and tooth extraction and denture replacement dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient crosscontamination 

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to the excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental care these markets demand diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces restorative compounds finishing devices custom restorative devices basic surgical instruments bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures 

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

acquisition activities

competition 

 

the company conducts its operations both domestic and foreign under highly competitive market conditions competition in the dental products industry is based primarily upon product performance quality safety and ease of use as well as price customer service innovation and acceptance by professionals and technicians dentsply believes that its principal strengths include its wellestablished brand names its reputation for highquality and innovative products its leadership in product development and manufacturing its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the company’s products by dental professionals 

 

the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company 

 

regulation 

 

the companys products are subject to regulation by among other governmental entities the united states food and drug administration the “fda” in general if a dental “device” is subject to fda regulation compliance with the fdas requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations in order to ensure that dental products distributed for human use in the united states are safe and effective the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and sale of dental products of the types produced by the company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with the fda and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

 

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the companys products obsolete 

 

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

 

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

 

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

 

dentsplys ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered 

 

the company’s international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect the operating results

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institutes of health and the united states public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated if the fda were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam filling materials as classes of products requiring fda premarket approval there can be no assurance that the required approval would be obtained or that the fda would permit the continued sale of amalgam filling materials pending its determination 

 

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

 

a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products in the future 

 

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees  

 

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation 

 

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time the company is named as a defendant in these cases the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business various parties including the company own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field although the company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the company to discontinue the sale of certain products

in addition the nasdaq national market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would harm the company’s business 

 

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire dentsply that might otherwise result in the company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

 

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan “esop” collectively own approximately 5 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply 

the company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

the company’s balance sheet includes debt and net investment hedges that are sensitive to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company’s statement of income

reference is made to the information about the companys foreign and domestic operations and export sales set forth in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

  

  

although many of its sales are made to distributors dealers and importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools who are the end users of its products as part of this enduser pull through marketing approach dentsply employs approximately 2000 highly trained productspecific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the dealers and the end users the company conducts extensive distributor and enduser marketing programs and trains laboratory technicians and dentists in the proper use of its products introducing them to the latest technological developments at its educational centers located throughout the world in key dental markets the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the company’s products 

  

dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social economic and technical development of the particular market geographic markets for dentsplys dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of development 

  

the united states canada western europe japan australia and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures on dental care in these markets the focus of dental care is increasingly upon preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such as the excavation and filling of cavities and tooth extraction and denture replacement dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures these markets require varied and complex dental products utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels of attention to protection against infection and patient crosscontamination 

  

in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe the pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to the excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental care these markets demand diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces restorative compounds finishing devices custom restorative devices basic surgical instruments bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures 

  

the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development the company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop the company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and innovative products technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves 

  

the company believes that the market for its products will grow based on the following factors 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

  

  

product development 

  

technological innovation and successful product development are critical to strengthening the company’s prominent position in worldwide dental markets maintaining its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high market share and increasing market share in product categories where gains are possible while many of dentsply’s existing products undergo evolutionary improvements the company also continues to successfully launch innovative products that represent fundamental change the company’s research and product development efforts have historically led to the introduction of more than twenty new products each year with approximately thirty new products having been introduced around the world in both 2005 and 2006 

  

new advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry as a result the company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development including partnerships and collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools 

  

through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations and partnerships with external research institutes and dental schools the company directly invested approximately 3 of net sales during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 in connection with the development of new products improvement of existing products and advances in technology the continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the companys strategic goal of taking a leadership role in defining the future of dentistry 

  

in addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement the company also invests in these activities through acquisitions by entering into licensing agreements and by purchasing technologies developed by other third parties 

  

acquisition activities 

  

dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of acquisition opportunities as a result during the past two years the company has made several small acquisitions including a group of three orthodontic companies acquired by the company during 2005 and two additional small businesses in 2006 the businesses acquired in 2006 include a small dental business in asia and an implant distribution business in italy during 2006 dentsply also acquired a 40 interest in materialise dental nv “materialise a simulation software company and a leading manufacturer of a variety of surgical guides to assist in the placement of dental implants dentsply also acquired the remaining 40 interest of a dental manufacturing business in brazil during 2006 the company had owned 60 of this business since 2001

 item 1a risk factors 

  

following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact dentsply’s business the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

  

negative changes could occur in the dental markets the general economic environments or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the company operates 

  

the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which it operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition many of the companys markets are affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs in certain markets government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the companys results 

  

the company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products 

  

dentsply has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitor’s new products will not be introduced that could render the companys products obsolete 

  

the dental supplies market is highly competitive and there is no guarantee that the company can compete successfully 

  

the worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive additionally the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of dentsplys competitors may have greater resources than does the company 

  

the company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits 

  

the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy the company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations if the company makes acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results 

  

the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate the business 

  

dentsplys ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt pay its contractual obligations and operate its business 

  

  

the company’s may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

  

dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success the manufacture of the companys products requires substantial and varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the companys products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its success 

  

the company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants 

  

dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income plus depreciation and amortization to interest expense any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered 

  

the company’s international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect the operating results 

  

dentsply with its significant international operations is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates of various foreign currencies and other risks associated with foreign trade and the impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be favorable or unfavorable 

  

the company may fail to comply with regulations issued by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies 

  

dentsplys business is subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda and similar foreign authorities to monitor dentsplys compliance with the regulations administered by such authorities there can be no assurance that these authorities will not raise compliance concerns failure to satisfy any such requirements can result in governmental enforcement actions including possible product seizure injunction andor criminal or civil proceedings 

  

all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold by dentsply contain mercury the fdas dental devices classification panel the national institutes of health and the united states public health service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated if the fda were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam filling materials as classes of products requiring fda premarket approval there can be no assurance that the required approval would be obtained or that the fda would permit the continued sale of amalgam filling materials pending its determination 

  

the company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties 

  

a significant portion of the company’s injectable anesthetic products orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers as there are a limited number of suppliers for these products there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products in the future 

  

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees  

  

the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

  

the company faces the inherent risk of litigation 

  

the company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time the company is named as a defendant in these cases the primary risks to which the company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the company the company has insurance policies including product liability insurance covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate however the company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the company could harm its business 

  

the company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline 

  

dentsply experiences fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result the company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause its stock price to decline 

  

the company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters the company typically implements most of its price changes in the third or fourth quarters of the year these price changes other marketing and promotional programs which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives may impact sales levels in a given period net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding the first and third quarters but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations particularly throughout europe 

  

the market price for the company’s common stock may become volatile 

  

a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of dentsply’s common stock causing volatility these factors include but are not necessarily limited to the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community changes in the company’s industry and competitors the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows any future issuances of dentsply’s common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time general market and economic conditions and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas the company does business 

  

in addition the nasdaq national market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the company’s common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would harm the company’s business 

  

certain provisions in the company’s governing documents may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire dentsply that might otherwise result in the company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

  

certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan collectively own approximately 6 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there have been changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended december 31 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management had previously identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting concerning the company’s lack of effective controls over the complete and accurate presentation and disclosure of shortterm investments as of december 31 2005 specifically the companys controls over the completeness and accuracy of shortterm investments in the consolidated balance sheet and the related cash flows from the purchase and sale of shortterm investments in the consolidated statement of cash flows were not effective this control deficiency resulted in the restatement of the companys 2005 and 2004 annual consolidated financial statements and the interim consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2006 and all quarters of 2005 and an audit adjustment to the interim consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2006 

  

in order to remediate the material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting with respect to the accounting for and disclosure of shortterm investments management has designed implemented and enhanced controls to ensure the proper presentation and disclosure of shortterm investments on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows specifically the company has expanded its internal reporting structure to include a specific category for shortterm investments and has enhanced its review and approval process to ensure that shortterm investments are properly classified on the consolidated balance sheet and statements of cash flows 

  

the company has evaluated the design of the improved controls described above which have been placed into operation for a sufficient period of time and tested their operating effectiveness it has concluded that these controls were both designed and operating effectively as of december 31 2006 and as a result of the implementation of these controls the previously identified material weakness no longer existed at december 31 2006 

  

there have been no other changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended december 31 2006 that have materially affected or are likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting

     the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued strength
of dental markets and the general economic environments of the regions in which
it operates negative changes to these markets and economies could materially
impact the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition
many of the companys markets are affected by government reimbursement and
regulatory programs changes to these programs could have a positive or negative
impact on the companys results

     certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third
party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division of
the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term
of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to
issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and
certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to
amend dentsplys bylaws and call special meetings of stockholders in addition
members of dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock
ownership plan collectively own approximately 10 of the outstanding common
stock of dentsply

domestic and foreign distributors dealers and importers however certain
highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys dental ceramics
crown and bridge porcelain products endodontic instruments and materials
orthodontic appliances implants and bone substitute and grafting materials are

percent of dentsplys consolidated net sales no other single customer
represented ten percent or more of dentsplys consolidated net sales during 2005
and no single customer represented ten percent or more of dentsplys
consolidated net sales during 2004

     reference is made to the information about the companys foreign and
domestic operations and export sales set forth in note 4 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k

     although much of its sales are made to distributors dealers and
importers dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists dental
hygienists dental assistants dental laboratories and dental schools who are
the end users of its products as part of this enduser pull through marketing
approach dentsply employs approximately 1800 highly trained productspecific
sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service
tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the
dealers and the end users the company conducts extensive distributor and
enduser marketing programs and trains laboratory technicians and dentists in
the proper use of its products introducing them to the latest technological
developments at its educational centers located throughout the world in key
dental markets the company also maintains ongoing relationships with various
dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental
field although there is no assurance that these influential dental
professionals will continue to support the companys products

     dentsply believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental
procedures and products varies according to the stage of social economic and
technical development of the particular market geographic markets for
dentsplys dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of
development

     the united states canada western europe japan australia and certain
other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced
dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures on
dental care in these markets the focus of dental care is increasingly upon
preventive care and specialized dentistry in addition to basic procedures such
as the excavation and filling of cavities and tooth extraction and denture
replacement dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and
cosmetic procedures these markets require varied and complex dental products
utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment and demand high levels
of attention to protection against infection and patient crosscontamination

     in certain countries in central america south america eastern europe the
pacific rim middle east and africa most dental care is often limited to the
excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques reflecting
more modest per capita expenditures for dental care these markets demand
diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces restorative compounds
finishing devices custom restorative devices basic surgical instruments
bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures

     the company offers products and equipment for use in markets at each of
these stages of development the company believes that as each of these markets
develop demand for more technically advanced products will increase the
company also believes that its recognized brand names high quality and
innovative products technical support services and strong international
distribution capabilities position it well to take advantage of any
opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

     the company believes that the market for its products will grow based on
the following factors

o increasing worldwide population

o    growth of the population 65 or older  the percentage of the united states
     european japanese and other regions population over age 65 is expected to
     nearly double by the year 2030 in addition to having significant needs for
     dental care the elderly are well positioned to pay for the required
     procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary income

o    natural teeth are being retained longer  individuals with natural teeth
     are much more likely to visit a dentist in a given year than those without
     any natural teeth remaining

o    the changing dental practice in the us  dentistry in north america has
     been transformed from a profession primarily dealing with pain infections
     and tooth decay to one with increased emphasis on preventive care and
     cosmetic dentistry

o    per capita and discretionary incomes are increasing in emerging nations 
     as personal incomes continue to rise in the emerging nations of the pacific
     rim and latin america healthcare including dental services are a growing
     priority

o    the companys business is less susceptible than other industries to general
     downturns in the economies in which it operates several of the products
     the company offers relate to dental procedures that are considered
     necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment


product development

     technological innovation and successful product development are critical to
strengthening the companys prominent position in worldwide dental markets
maintaining its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high
market share and increasing market share in product categories where gains are
possible while many of dentsplys existing products undergo evolutionary
improvements the company also continues to successfully launch innovative
products that represent fundamental change its research centers throughout the
world employ approximately 350 scientists phds engineers technicians and
support staff dedicated to research and product development the company
directly invested approximately 3 of net sales during the years ended december
31 2005 2004 and 2003 or 470 million 446 million and 433 million
respectively in connection with the development of new products and in the
improvement of existing products in addition to the direct investment in
product development and improvement the company also invests in these
activities through acquisitions by entering into licensing agreements and by
purchasing technologies developed by other third parties

     the benefits from the companys advanced technology function which was
established in 2004 to focus on new and emerging technologies in dentistry were
evident in 2005 as discussed in the overview section of managements discussion
and analysis the continued development of this function is a critical step in
meeting the companys strategic goal of taking a leadership role in defining the
future of dentistry

     there can be no assurance that dentsply will be able to continue to develop
innovative products or that regulatory approval of any new products will be
obtained or that if such approvals are obtained such products will be
favorably accepted in the marketplace additionally there is no assurance that
entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment will not be introduced
that could render the companys current products obsolete


acquisition activities

      dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to
experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and
distribution although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of
acquisition opportunities as a result during the past five years the company
has made several acquisitions including three significant acquisitions made
during 2001 these acquisitions included the degussa dental group friadent gmbh
and the dental injectable anaesthetic assets of astrazeneca in addition to
these significant acquisitions the company has also continued to make smaller
acquisitions including a group of three orthodontic companies acquired by the
company during 2005 the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of
its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to supplement the

                                        5
page

companys core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business in addition
acquisitions have provided dentsply with new technologies and additional product
and geographic breadth the company continues to be active in evaluating
potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will
result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the
success of such activities if the company does succeed in acquiring a business
or product there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any of the
benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and
effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert
managements attention from normal business operations if the company makes
acquisitions it may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create
additional expenses any of which might adversely affect its financial results
any financing that the company might need for acquisitions may only be available
to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that
reduce its operating results


operating and technical expertise

     dentsply believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its
success the manufacture of the companys products requires substantial and
varied technical expertise complex materials technology and processes are
necessary to manufacture the companys products the company continues to
automate its global manufacturing operations in order to remain a low cost
producer

     the company has completed or is in progress of completing a number of key
initiatives around the world that are focused on helping the company improve its
sales and operating margins

o    the company formed dentsply north america which is a sales organization
     that effectively combines the field and sales management functions for the
     united states distributor businesses

o    a corporate purchasing office was established to leverage the buying power
     of dentsply around the world and reduce the companys product costs through
     lower prices and reduced related overhead

o    the company has centralized its warehousing and distribution in north
     america and europe while the initial gains from this strategy have been
     realized ongoing efforts are in place to maximize additional opportunities
     that can be gained through improving the companys functional expertise in
     supply chain management

o    the company considers the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques
     as a fundamental part of its supply chain strategy with a focus on
     reducing nonvalue added activities over the last decade numerous
     manufacturing sites have dramatically reduced inventory levels increased
     space utilization and improved labor productivity this was accomplished
     while reducing manufacturing lead times and improving the companys
     delivery performance to dealers and endusers

o    dentsply has seen improved productivity and cost reductions from the
     operation of a north american shared services group as a result the
     company is currently in the process of finalizing the transition of certain
     processes in europe to a shared services group in yverdon switzerland
     which it expects to be fully implemented in 2006

o    information technology initiatives are underway to generate enhanced
     worldwide financial data to standardize worldwide telecommunications
     implement improved manufacturing customer relations management crm and
     financial accounting systems and to train it users to maximize the
     capabilities of global systems

o    dentsply continues to pursue opportunities to leverage its assets by
     consolidating business units where appropriate and to optimize its
     diversity of worldwide manufacturing capabilities

o    dentsply is in the process of developing a new business system which will
     provide a framework of best in class tools to help streamline decision
     making gain efficiencies and accelerate internal growth by setting
     standards across all key areas of the business

financing

     dentsplys total longterm debt including the current portion of longterm
debt at december 31 2005 was 6809 million and the ratio of longterm debt to
total capitalization was 354 this capitalization ratio is down from 544 at
december 31 2001 the quarter in which the degussa dental acquisition was
completed dentsply defines total capitalization as the sum of total longterm
debt including the current portion plus total stockholders equity dentsply
may incur additional debt in the future including but not limited to the
funding of additional acquisitions and capital expenditures dentsplys ability
to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its operations depends on its
future performance and financial results which to a certain extent are
subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other
factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control although
management believes that the company has and will continue to have sufficient
liquidity there can be no assurance that dentsplys business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt and
operate its business

     the companys cash decreased 718 million during the year ended december
31 2005 to 4345 million in 2005 the company repaid 601 million of
maturing longterm borrowings and repurchased 1648 million in treasury stock
the company continued to maintain significant cash balances during 2005 rather
than prepay debt as a result of prepayment penalties that would be incurred
in retiring both the debt and the related interest rate swap agreements
additionally the company has not repaid this debt prior to its due date due to
the low cost of the debt net of earnings on the cash the company has 5307
million of longterm borrowings coming due in 2006 the company intends to repay
these debt obligations with cash andor funds available to the company under the
revolving credit facility any portion of the debt that is repaid through the
use of the revolving credit facility will be contractually due in may 2010 upon
the expiration of the facility thus effectively converting the maturity of the
debt beyond 2006 the company currently intends to effectively refinance 1199
million of the longterm borrowings coming due in 2006 through use of the
revolving credit facility

     dentsplys existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants
and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy the most restrictive of
these covenants pertain to asset dispositions maintenance of certain levels of
net worth and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating
income plus depreciation and amortization to interest expense any breach of any
such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing
borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings
under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and through cross
default provisions would entitle dentsplys other lenders to accelerate their
loans dentsply may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding
indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered at
december 31 2005 the company was in compliance with these covenants

     additional information about dentsplys working capital liquidity and
capital resources is provided in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form

competition

     the company conducts its operations both domestic and foreign under
highly competitive market conditions competition in the dental products
industry is based primarily upon product performance quality safety and ease
of use as well as price customer service innovation and acceptance by
professionals and technicians dentsply believes that its principal strengths
include its wellestablished brand names its reputation for highquality and
innovative products its leadership in product development and manufacturing
and its commitment to customer satisfaction

     the size and number of the companys competitors vary by product line and
from region to region there are many companies that produce some but not all
of the same types of products as those produced by the company certain of
dentsplys competitors may have greater resources than does the company in
certain of its product offerings

     the worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive there can
be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product
opportunities and develop and market new products successfully or that new
products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the
companys products obsolete or noncompetitive

                                        7

regulation

     the companys products are subject to regulation by among other
governmental entities the united states food and drug administration the
fda in general if a dental device is subject to fda regulation
compliance with the fdas requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding
state regulations in order to ensure that dental products distributed for human
use in the united states are safe and effective the fda regulates the
introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing and
distribution of and recordkeeping for such products the introduction and
sale of dental products of the types produced by the company are also subject to
government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are
produced or sold dentsply believes that it is in substantial compliance with
the foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable to its products and
manufacturing operations

     dental devices of the types sold by dentsply are generally classified by
the fda into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that
apply to all medical devices including regulations regarding alteration
misbranding notification recordkeeping and good manufacturing practices
dentsplys facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to monitor
dentsplys compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that the
fda will not raise compliance concerns failure to satisfy fda requirements can
result in fda enforcement actions including product seizure injunction andor
criminal or civil proceedings in the european union dentsplys products are
subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based
on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the
safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations dentsply
products in europe bear the ce sign showing that such products adhere to the
european regulations

     all dental amalgam filling materials including those manufactured and sold
by dentsply contain mercury various groups have alleged that dental amalgam
containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state
and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes
restricting the use or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks of
dental amalgams the fdas dental devices classification panel the national
institutes of health and the united states public health service have each
indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has
been demonstrated if the fda were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam
filling materials as classes of products requiring fda premarket approval
there can be no assurance that the required approval would be obtained or that
the fda would permit the continued sale of amalgam filling materials pending its
determination in europe in particular in scandinavia and germany the contents
of mercury in amalgam filling materials has been the subject of public
discussion as a consequence in 1994 the german health authorities required
suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use for amalgam
filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for
children under eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age dentsply
also manufactures and sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not
contain mercury


sources and supply of raw materials and finished goods

    all of the raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its
products are purchased from various suppliers and are available from numerous
sources no single supplier accounts for a significant percentage of dentsplys
raw material requirements

     there are a limited number of suppliers for the dental injectable
anesthetic products sold by the company while the company had some supply
disruptions in 2005 and anticipates some supply disruptions in 2006 the company
currently has contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of dental
injectable anesthetic product for most of the markets served by the company
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate
supply of its injectable anesthetic products in the future

     the companys success is dependent upon its management and employees the
loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed
managerial sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect
on the company

     certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third
party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division of
the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term
of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors to
issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and
certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to

item 3  legal proceedings

     dentsply and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
arising out of their respective operations the company believes it is unlikely
that pending litigation to which dentsply is a party will have a material
adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position or results of
operations

     in june 1995 the antitrust division of the united states department of
justice initiated an antitrust investigation regarding the policies and conduct
undertaken by the companys trubyte division with respect to the distribution of
artificial teeth and related products on january 5 1999 the department of
justice filed a complaint against the company in the us district court in
wilmington delaware alleging that the companys tooth distribution practices
violate the antitrust laws and seeking an order for the company to discontinue
its practices the trial in the governments case was held in april and may 2002
and subsequently the judge entered a decision that the companys tooth
distribution practices do not violate the antitrust laws the department of
justice appealed this decision to the us third circuit court of appeals and
the third circuit reversed the decision of the district court the companys
petition to the us supreme court asking it to review the third circuit court
decision was denied the effect of this decision will be the issuance of an
injunction requiring dentsply to discontinue its policy of not allowing its
tooth dealers to take on new competitive teeth lines this decision relates only
to the distribution of artificial teeth sold in the us which affects less
than 25 of the companys net sales while the company believes its tooth
distribution practices do not violate the antitrust laws the company is
confident that it can continue to develop this business regardless of the final
legal outcome

     subsequent to the filing of the department of justice complaint in 1999
several private party class actions were filed based on allegations similar to
those in the department of justice case on behalf of laboratories and denture
patients in seventeen states who purchased trubyte teeth or products containing
trubyte teeth these cases were transferred to the us district court in
wilmington delaware the private party suits seek damages in an unspecified
amount the court has granted the companys motion on the lack of standing of
the laboratory and patient class actions to pursue damage claims the plaintiffs
in the laboratory case appealed this decision to the third circuit and the court
upheld the decision of the district court in dismissing the plaintiffs damages
claims with the exception of allowing the plaintiffs to pursue a damage claim
based on a theory of resale price maintenance agreements between the company and
its tooth dealers the plaintiffs have filed a petition with the us supreme
court asking it to review this decision of the third circuit also private
party class actions on behalf of indirect purchasers were filed in california
and florida state courts the california and florida cases have been dismissed
by the plaintiffs following the decision by the federal district court judge
issued in august 2003

on march 27 2002 a complaint was filed in alameda county california which
was transferred to los angeles county by bruce glover dds alleging inter
alia breach of express and implied warranties fraud unfair trade practices
and negligent misrepresentation in the companys manufacture and sale of
advancer cement the complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount for
costs incurred in repairing dental work in which the advancer product
allegedly failed the judge has entered an order granting class certification
as an optin class this means that after notice of the class action is sent to
possible class members a party will have to determine if they meet the class
definition and take affirmative action in order to join the class on the claims
of breach of warranty and fraud in general the class is defined as california
dentists who purchased and used advancer cement and were required because of
failures of the cement to repair or reperform dental procedures for which they
were not paid the notice of the class action was sent on february 23 2005 to
the approximately 29000 dentists licensed to practice in california during the
relevant period and a total of 166 dentists have opted into the class action as
the result of a recent decision by a california appellate court the plaintiffs
have filed an appeal to convert the claim to an optout claim from its current
status as an optin claim the advancer cement product was sold from 1994
through 2000 and total sales in the united states during that period were
approximately 52 million the companys primary level insurance carrier has
confirmed coverage for the breach of warranty claims in this matter up to their
policy limits

   the  success  of the  company is largely  dependent  upon the  continued
strength of dental  markets and the general  economic  environments  of the
regions  in which it  operates  negative  changes  to  these  markets  and
economies could materially  impact the companys  results of operations and
financial  condition  in  addition  many  of the  companys  markets  are
affected by government  reimbursement  programs  changes to these programs
could have a positive or negative impact on the companys results

   certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult
for a third party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include
the division of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes
with the threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision
allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights
senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements
which make it difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and
call special meetings of stockholders in addition members of dentsplys
management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan
collectively own approximately 10 of the outstanding common stock of
dentsply which may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire
control of dentsply in a transaction that is opposed by dentsplys
management and employees

markets sales and distribution

   dentsply  distributes  approximately  55 of its dental products through
domestic  and  foreign  distributors   dealers  and  importers   however
certain  highly  technical  products such as precious  metal dental alloys
dental   ceramics   crown  and  bridge  porcelain   products   endodontic
instruments  and  materials  orthodontic  appliances  implants  and  bone
substitute  and  grafting   materials  are  sold  directly  to  the  dental
laboratory  or dental  professional  in some  markets  no single  customer
accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated net sales in 2004

   reference is made to the  information  about the  companys  foreign and
domestic  operations  and export  sales set forth in note 4 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k

   although  much of its  sales  are  made to  distributors  dealers  and
importers  dentsply focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists  dental
hygienists  dental assistants  dental laboratories and dental schools who
are  the end  users  of its  products  as  part  of  this  enduser  pull
through marketing  approach  dentsply employs  approximately 1700 highly
trained   productspecific   sales   and   technical   staff  to   provide
comprehensive  marketing and service  tailored to the particular  sales and
technical  support  requirements  of the  dealers  and the end  users  the
company  conducts  extensive  distributor and enduser  marketing  programs
and trains  laboratory  technicians  and  dentists in the proper use of its
products  introducing  them to the latest  technological  developments  at
its  educational  centers  located  throughout  the  world  in  key  dental
markets  the company also  maintains  ongoing  relationships  with various
dental  associations  and  recognized  worldwide  opinion  leaders  in  the
dental  field  although  there  is no  assurance  that  these  influential
dental professionals will continue to support our products

   dentsply  believes that demand in a given  geographic  market for dental
procedures and products varies  according to the stage of social  economic
and  technical  development  that  the  market  has  attained   geographic
markets  for  dentsplys  dental  products  can  be  categorized  into  the
following three stages of development

   the united states  canada  western europe the united kingdom  japan
and  australia are highly  developed  markets that demand the most advanced
dental  procedures and products and have the highest level of  expenditures
on  dental  care   in  these   markets   the  focus  of  dental  care  is
increasingly  upon preventive care and specialized  dentistry  in addition
to basic  procedures  such as the  excavation  and filling of cavities  and
tooth extraction and denture replacement  dental professionals  perform an
increasing  volume of  preventive  and cosmetic  procedures  these markets
require  varied  and  complex  dental   products   utilize   sophisticated
diagnostic  and imaging  equipment  and demand high levels of attention to
protection against infection and patient crosscontamination

   in certain  countries in central america  south america and the pacific
rim  dental  care is  often  limited  to the  excavation  and  filling  of
cavities  and other  restorative  techniques  reflecting  more  modest per
capita   expenditures   for  dental  care  these  markets  demand  diverse
products  such as high and low  speed  handpieces  restorative  compounds
finishing devices and custom restorative devices

   in the peoples republic of china india  eastern europe the countries
of  the  former  soviet  union  and  other  developing  countries  dental
ailments  are  treated  primarily  through  tooth  extraction  and  denture
replacement   these   procedures   require  basic  surgical   instruments
artificial teeth for dentures and bridgework

   the company offers  products and equipment for use in markets at each of
these stages of  development  the company  believes  that as each of these
markets  develop  demand  for  more  technically  advanced  products  will
increase  the company also believes that its recognized brand names  high
quality and  innovative  products  technical  support  services and strong
international   distribution   capabilities   position   it  well  to  take
advantage  of any  opportunities  for growth in all of the markets  that it
serves

   the company  believes  that the market for its products  will grow based
on the following factors

o     increasing worldwide population

o     growth of the  population 65 or older  the  percentage of the united
   states  european  and  japanese  population  over age 65 is expected to
   nearly  double by the year  2030  in  addition  to  having  significant
   needs for dental care  the elderly are well  positioned  to pay for the
   required  procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary
   income

o     natural teeth are being  retained  longer  individuals  with natural
   teeth are much  more  likely  to visit a  dentist  in a given  year than
   those without any natural teeth remaining

o     the  changing  dental  practice  in the  us    dentistry  in north
   america has been  transformed from a profession  primarily  dealing with
   pain  infections  and tooth  decay to one with  increased  emphasis  on
   preventive care and cosmetic dentistry
o     per capita and  discretionary  incomes  are  increasing  in  emerging
   nations  as personal  incomes  continue to rise in the emerging nations
   of the  pacific  rim and latin  america  healthcare  including  dental
   services are a growing priority

o     the companys  business is less  susceptible than other industries to
   general downturns in the economies in which it operates  several of the
   products  the  company  offers  relate  to  dental  procedures  that are
   considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment

product development

   technological   innovation  and  successful   product   development  are
critical to  strengthening  the companys  prominent  position in worldwide
dental   markets   maintaining   its   leadership   positions  in  product
categories  where it has a high market share  and increasing  market share
in product  categories  where gains are possible  while many of dentsplys
innovations represent  evolutionary  improvements of existing products the
company also  continues to  successfully  launch  products  that  represent
fundamental  change  its  research  centers  throughout  the world  employ
approximately 400 scientists  phds engineers  technicians and support
staff dedicated to research and product  development  approximately  446
million  433 million  and 399 million  respectively  was internally
invested  by  the  company  in  connection  with  the  development  of  new
products  and in the  improvement  of existing  products in the years ended
2004 2003 and 2002  respectively  in addition the company licenses and
purchases  technologies  developed by other third  parties as part of these
activities

   in 2004 the company  established an office of advanced technology which
will focus on new and emerging  technologies in dentistry  the creation of
this function is a critical step in meeting the  companys  strategic  goal
of taking a leadership role in defining the future of dentistry

   there can be no  assurance  that  dentsply  will be able to  continue to
develop  innovative  products  and  that  regulatory  approval  of any  new
products will be obtained  or that if such  approvals  are obtained  such
products  will be  favorably  accepted  in the  marketplace  additionally
there is no  assurance  that  entirely  new  technology  or  approaches  to
dental  treatment  will not be  introduced  that could render the companys
products obsolete


operating and technical expertise

   dentsply believes that its  manufacturing  capabilities are important to
its  success   the   manufacture  of  the  companys   products   requires
substantial and varied technical  expertise  complex materials  technology
and processes  are necessary to  manufacture  the companys  products  the
company  continues  to  automate  its global  manufacturing  operations  in
order to remain a low cost producer

   the company has  constructed  a major dental  anesthetic  filling  plant
outside  chicago  which was  completed in 2004  the company  believes that
this plant will become  operational  following the approval and validation
of the  manufacturing  practices by the medicines and  healthcare  products
regulatory  agency  mhra  the  agency  responsible  for drug  products
approvals in the united  kingdom  the mhra inspected the plant in november
2004 and we are  awaiting  their  approval  upon  approval by the mhra and
subsequent  approval by the  relative  health  authorities  the plant will
begin to supply injectible  anesthetic  product to the companys markets in
the  united  kingdom   ireland   australia  and  new  zealand  we  also
anticipate  making our formal  submission  for  approval to the fda for the
us and  canadian  markets in the first  quarter of 2005  upon receipt of
fda  approval   the  plant  is  expected  to  supply  these  markets  with
injectible  anesthetic  product  this  initiative is very important to the
company  since  the  assets  acquired  from  astrazeneca  did  not  include
production  facilities  since the  purchase  the company  has  contracted
with  astrazeneca  and other  third  party  manufacturers  to  produce  the
companys  injectible  anesthetic product  requirements at their facilities
on a contract  manufacturing  basis  until this plant can  produce  for the
respective  markets  the supply contracts with astrazeneca for the markets
in the united  kingdom  ireland  australia  and new zealand have expired
in  april  2004  and  the  contracts  with  astrazenaca  for the  us  and
canadian   markets  will  expire  in  june  2005  the  company  has  built
inventory of products  from the  contracted  manufacturers  in an effort to
meet  anticipated  needs  of  the  market  until  the  companys  plant  is
approved  however  there is no assurance that the approvals from the mhra
or the fda will be received in a timely  manner to prevent an  interruption
of the supply of inventory

   the  company  has  completed  or has in  progress  a number of other key
initiatives  around the world  that are  focused  on  helping  the  company
improve its operating margins

o     a corporate  purchasing  office has been  established to leverage the
   buying power of dentsply  around the world and reduce our product  costs
   through lower prices and reduced related overhead

o     the company has  centralized  its  warehousing  and  distribution  in
   north  america and europe  while the initial  gains from this  strategy
   have been realized  ongoing efforts are in place to maximize additional
   opportunities  that  can be  gained  through  improving  our  functional
   expertise in supply chain  management  in an effort to improve customer
   service  levels and reduce  costs  the company  relocated  its european
   warehouse from nijmegen  the netherlands to radolfzell  germany in the
   first quarter of 2004

o     the  company  considers  the  implementation  of  lean  manufacturing
   techniques as a fundamental  part of its supply chain  strategy  with a
   focus on reducing  nonvalue added  activities  numerous  manufacturing
   sites  have  dramatically  reduced  inventory  levels  increased  space
   utilization  and  improved  labor  productivity  this was  accomplished
   while  reducing  manufacturing  lead times and  improving  the companys
   delivery performance to dealers and endusers

o     dentsply has seen improved  productivity and cost reductions from the
   formation of a north american shared  services  group as a result  the
   company is currently in the process of  establishing  a european  shared
   services  group in  yverdon  switzerland  which it  expects to be fully
   implemented by the first quarter of 2006

o     information  technology initiatives are underway to generate enhanced
   worldwide financial data to standardize  worldwide  telecommunications
   implement  improved  manufacturing and financial  accounting systems and
   an ongoing  training of it users to maximize the  capabilities of global
   systems

o     dentsply continues to pursue  opportunities to leverage its assets by
   consolidating  business  units where  appropriate  and to  optimize  its
   diversity of worldwide manufacturing capabilities

financing

   dentsplys  longterm  debt at december 31 2004 was 7815  million and
the  ratio  of  longterm  debt to total  capitalization  was  351  this
capitalization  ratio is down from 543 at december 31 2001  the quarter
in which the degussa dental  acquisition was completed  dentsply may incur
additional  debt  in  the  future  including  the  funding  of  additional
acquisitions  and  capital   expenditures   dentsplys   ability  to  make
payments on its  indebtedness  and to fund its  operations  depends on its
future performance and financial  results  which to a certain extent are
subject to general economic financial  competitive  regulatory and other
factors and the  interest  rate  environment  that are beyond its  control
although  management  believes  that the company  has and will  continue to
have  sufficient  liquidity  there  can be no  assurance  that  dentsplys
business will generate  sufficient  cash flow from operations in the future
to service its debt and operate its business

   the companys cash increased 3426 million during the year ended
december 31 2004 to 5064 million the company has continued to
accumulate cash in 2004 rather than reduce debt due to prepayment
penalties that would be incurred in retiring debt and the related
interest rate swap agreements in addition to the low cost of this debt
net of earnings on the cash

   dentsplys  existing  borrowing   documentation  contains  a  number  of
covenants  and financial  ratios which it is required to satisfy  the most
restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset  dispositions  maintenance
of certain levels of net worth  and prescribed  ratios of  indebtedness to
total capital and operating  income plus  depreciation  and amortization to
interest  expense  any breach of any such covenants or restrictions  would
result in a default under the existing  borrowing  documentation that would
permit the lenders to declare all borrowings  under such  documentation  to
be  immediately  due and payable and  through  cross  default  provisions
would  entitle   dentsplys   other  lenders  to  accelerate  their  loans
dentsply  may not be able to meet its  obligations  under  its  outstanding
indebtedness  in the event that any cross  default  provision is triggered
at december 31 2004 the company was in compliance with these covenants

   the  company has 698  million of  longterm  borrowings  coming due in
2005  additional  information about dentsplys working capital  liquidity
and  capital   resources  is  provided  in  managements   discussion  and
analysis of financial  condition and results of  operations in this annual

competition

   the company  conducts its operations  both domestic and foreign  under
highly competitive  market  conditions  competition in the dental products
industry is based primarily upon product performance  quality  safety and
ease  of  use  as  well  as  price   customer  service   innovation  and
acceptance by  professionals  and technicians  dentsply  believes that its
principal   strengths  include  its   wellestablished   brand  names  its
reputation  for  highquality  and innovative  products  its leadership in
product  development  and  manufacturing  and its  commitment  to customer
satisfaction

   the size and number of the  companys  competitors  vary by product line
and from region to region  there are many  companies  that  produce  some
but not  all  of the same  types of  products  as  those  produced  by the
company  certain of  dentsplys  competitors  may have  greater  resources
than does the company in certain of its product offerings

   the worldwide  market for dental supplies is highly  competitive  there
can be no  assurance  that  the  company  will  successfully  identify  new
product  opportunities  and develop and market new  products  successfully
or that new products and  technologies  introduced by competitors  will not
render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive

regulation

   the  companys  products  are  subject to  regulation  by  among  other
governmental  entities  the  united  states  food and drug  administration
the  fda  in  general   if  a  dental  device  is  subject  to  fda
regulation  compliance with the fdas requirements  constitutes compliance
with  corresponding  state  regulations  in order to  ensure  that  dental
products  distributed  for  human  use in the  united  states  are safe and
effective  the fda regulates the introduction  manufacture  advertising
labeling  packaging  marketing and  distribution  of and  recordkeeping
for  such  products  the  anesthetic  products  sold by the  company  are
regulated  as a  drug  by the  fda  and by  all  other  similar  regulatory
agencies around the world

   dental  devices of the types sold by dentsply are  generally  classified
by the fda into a  category  that  renders  them  subject  only to  general
controls  that  apply  to  all  medical  devices   including   regulations
regarding alteration  misbranding  notification  recordkeeping and good
manufacturing  practices  dentsplys  facilities  are  subject to periodic
inspection  by  the  fda  to  monitor  dentsplys   compliance  with  these
regulations  there  can be no  assurance  that  the  fda  will  not  raise
compliance  concerns  failure to satisfy  fda  requirements  can result in
fda enforcement  actions  including  product  seizure  injunction  andor
criminal or civil proceedings  in the european union  dentsplys products
are  subject to the  medical  devices  laws of the  various  member  states
which  are  based on a  directive  of the  european  commission  such laws
generally  regulate  the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda
regulations  dentsply  products  in europe bear the ce sign  showing  that
such products adhere to the european regulations

   all dental amalgam filling  materials  including those manufactured and
sold by  dentsply  contain  mercury  various  groups  have  alleged  that
dental  amalgam  containing  mercury is  harmful  to human  health and have
actively  lobbied state and federal  lawmakers and  regulators to pass laws
or adopt  regulatory  changes  restricting  the use or requiring a warning
against  alleged  potential  risks  of dental  amalgams  the fdas dental
devices  classification  panel  the national  institutes of health and the
united  states  public health  service have each  indicated  that no direct
hazard to humans from  exposure to dental  amalgams has been  demonstrated
if  the  fda  were  to  reclassify   dental  mercury  and  amalgam  filling
materials as classes of products requiring fda premarket  approval  there
can be no assurance  that the required  approval  would be obtained or that
the fda would  permit  the  continued  sale of  amalgam  filling  materials
pending its  determination  in europe  in particular in  scandinavia  and
germany  the  contents of mercury in amalgam  filling  materials  has been
the  subject of public  discussion  as a  consequence  in 1994 the german
health  authorities  required  suppliers  of  dental  amalgam  to amend the
instructions  for  use  for  amalgam  filling   materials   to  include  a
precaution  against the use of amalgam for children  under  eighteen  years
of age and to women of childbearing  age  dentsply also  manufactures  and
sells nonamalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury

   the  introduction  and sale of dental  products of the types produced by
the  company  are also  subject to  government  regulation  in the  various
foreign  countries  in which they are produced or sold  dentsply  believes
that  it  is  in  substantial   compliance  with  the  foreign   regulatory
requirements   that  are  applicable  to  its  products  and  manufacturing
operations


sources and supply of raw materials

  all of the raw materials  used by the company in the  manufacture  of its
products  are  purchased  from various  suppliers  and are  available  from
numerous   sources   no  single   supplier   accounts  for  a  significant
percentage of dentsplys raw material requirements

intellectual property

   products  manufactured  by  dentsply  are sold  primarily  under its own
trademarks  and trade names  dentsply  also owns and  maintains  more than
2000  patents  throughout  the world and is licensed  under a small number
of patents owned by others

   dentsplys  policy is to protect its  products  and  technology  through
patents  and   trademark   registrations   in  the  united  states  and  in
significant   international   markets   for  its   products   the  company
carefully  monitors  trademark use worldwide  and promotes  enforcement of
its  patents  and  trademarks  in a manner  that is designed to balance the
cost of such  protection  against  obtaining  the  greatest  value  for the
company  dentsply  believes  its  patents  and  trademark  properties  are
important and  contribute to the companys  marketing  position but it does
not  consider  its overall  business to be  materially  dependent  upon any
individual patent or trademark


employees

   as of december  31  2004  the company  and its  subsidiaries  employed
approximately  7700  employees   a  small  percentage  of  the  companys
employees  are   represented  by  labor  unions   hourly  workers  at  the
companys  ransom  randolph  facility in maumee  ohio are  represented by

postretirement  benefits  to many of these  employees  see  note 14 to the
consolidated   financial   statements   the  company  believes  that  its
relationship with its employees is good

   the companys  success is dependent  upon its  management and employees
the loss of senior  management  employees  or any  failure to  recruit  and
train  needed  managerial  sales  and  technical  personnel  could  have a
material adverse effect on the company

acquisition activities

   dentsply believes that the dental products industry continues to
experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and
distribution although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of
acquisition opportunities as a result during the past five years the
company has made several acquisitions including three significant
acquisitions made during 2001 these acquisitions included the degussa
dental group friadent gmbh and the dental injectible anaesthetic assets
of astrazeneca the company continues to view acquisitions as a key part
of its growth strategy these acquisition activities are intended to
supplement the companys core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its
business in addition acquisitions have provided dentsply with new
technologies and additional product and geographic breadth the company
continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although
there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed
transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such
activities if we do succeed in acquiring a business or product there
can be no assurance that we will achieve any of the benefits that we
might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort
devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert
managements attention from normal business operations  if we make
acquisitions we may incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create
additional expenses any of which might adversely effect our financial
results  any financing that we might need for acquisitions may only be
available to us on terms that restrict our business or that impose
additional costs that reduce our operating results

item 3  legal proceedings


   dentsply and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
arising out of their respective operations  the company believes it is
unlikely that pending litigation to which dentsply is a party will have a
material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position or
results of operations

   in june 1995 the antitrust division of the united states department of
justice initiated an antitrust investigation regarding the policies and
conduct undertaken by the companys trubyte division with respect to the
distribution of artificial teeth and related products  on january 5
1999 the department of justice filed a complaint against the company in
the us district court in wilmington delaware alleging that the
companys tooth distribution practices violate the antitrust laws and
seeking an order for the company to discontinue its practices  the trial
in the governments case was held in april and may 2002 on august 14
2003 the judge entered a decision that the companys tooth distribution
practices do not violate the antitrust laws the department of justice
appealed this decision to the us third circuit court of appeals  the
third circuit court issued its decision on february 22 2005 and reversed
the decision of the district court the effect of this decision if it
withstands any appeal challenge by the company will be the issuance of
an injunction requiring dentsply to discontinue its policy of not
allowing its tooth dealers to take on new competitive teeth lines  this
decision relates only to the distribution of artificial teeth sold in the
us which affects less than 25 of the companys sales while the
company believes its tooth distribution practices do not violate the
antitrust laws we are confident that we can continue to develop this
business regardless of the final legal outcome the company is currently
evaluating its legal options as well as its marketing and sales
strategies in light of the current court ruling

   subsequent to the filing of the department of justice complaint in
1999 several private party class actions were filed based on allegations
similar to those in the department of justice case on behalf of
laboratories and denture patients in seventeen states who purchased
trubyte teeth or products containing trubyte teeth these cases were
transferred to the us district court in wilmington delaware  the
private party suits seek damages in an unspecified amount  the court has
granted the companys motion on the lack of standing of the laboratory
and patient class actions to pursue damage claims the plaintiffs in the
laboratory case have appealed this decision to the third circuit and
briefs of the parties have been submitted  also private party class
actions on behalf of indirect purchasers were filed in california and
florida state courts  the california and florida cases have been
dismissed by the plaintiffs following the decision by the federal
district court judge issued in august 2003

   on march 27 2002 a complaint was filed in alameda county california
which was transferred to los angeles county by bruce glover dds
alleging inter alia breach of express and implied warranties fraud
unfair trade practices and negligent misrepresentation in the companys
manufacture and sale of advancer cement  the complaint seeks damages in
an unspecified amount for costs incurred in repairing dental work in
which the advancer product allegedly failed the judge has entered an
order granting class certification as an optin class this means that
after notice of the class action is sent to possible class members a
party will have to determine they meet the class definition and take
affirmative action in order to join the class on the claims of breach of
warranty and fraud  in general the class is defined as california
dentists who purchased and used advancer cement and were required
because of failures of the cement to repair or reperform dental
procedures  the notice of the class action was sent on february 23 2005
to dentists licensed to practice in california during the relevant
period  the advancer cement product was sold from 1994 through 2000 and
total sales in the united states during that period were approximately
52 million the companys insurance carrier has confirmed coverage for
the breach of warranty claims in this matter

   on july 13 2004 the company was served with a complaint filed by 3m
innovative properties company in the us district court for the western
district of wisconsin alleging that the companys aquasilr ultra
silicone impression material introduced in late 2002 infringes a 3m
patent this case was settled in the first quarter of 2005 which was
within the range of loss for which the company had previously recorded
accruals and dentsply obtained a paid up license under the 3m patent

   dentsply believes that the dental products industry is
experiencing substantial consolidation with respect to both
product manufacturing and distribution although it continues to
be fragmented creating numerous acquisition opportunities as a
result during the past three years the company has made
numerous acquisitions including three significant acquisitions
made during 2001 in january 2001 the company acquired the
outstanding shares of friadent gmbh friadent a global dental
implant manufacturer and marketer previously headquartered in
mannheim germany in march 2001 the company acquired the dental
injectible anaesthetic assets of astrazeneca az assets the
assets acquired in the business consisted primarily of an
exclusive perpetual royaltyfree licensing rights to the dental
products and tradenames  in addition certain limited equipment
was acquired but no production facilities were acquired as part
of the transaction  in october 2001 the company acquired the
degussa dental group degussa dental a manufacturer and
seller of dental products including precious metal alloys
ceramics dental laboratory equipment and chairside products
previously headquartered in hanau germany information about
these acquisitions and other acquisition and divestiture
activities is set forth in note 3 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements in the companys 2003 annual report to
shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference  these
acquisitions are intended to supplement dentsplys core growth
and assure ongoing expansion of its business in addition
acquisitions have provided dentsply with new technologies and
additional product breadth

   certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws and of delaware law could have the effect of making
it difficult for a third party to acquire control of dentsply
such provisions include the division of the board of directors of
dentsply into three classes with the threeyear term of a class
expiring each year a provision allowing the board of directors
to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the
common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it
difficult for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and call
special meetings of stockholders in addition members of
dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock
ownership plan collectively own approximately 10 of the
outstanding common stock of dentsply which may discourage a
third party from attempting to acquire control of dentsply in a
transaction that is opposed by dentsplys management and
employees

importers  however  certain  highly  technical  products  such as
precious metal dental  alloys  dental  ceramics  crown and bridge
porcelain   products   endodontic   instruments   and   materials
orthodontic  appliances  implants and bone substitute and grafting
materials  are sold  directly  to the dental  laboratory  or dental
professional  in some  markets  no single  customer  accounted for
more than ten percent of consolidated net sales in 2003

   reference  is  made  to  the  information  about  the  companys
foreign  and  domestic  operations  and  export  sales set forth in
note 4 of the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements in this
annual report on form 10k

   although  much of its sales are made to  distributors  dealers
and  importers  dentsply  focuses  its  marketing  efforts  on the
dentists    dental   hygienists    dental   assistants    dental
laboratories  and  dental  schools  who are the  end  users  of its
products  as  part  of  this  enduser  pull  through  marketing
approach  dentsply  employs  approximately  1700 highly  trained
productspecific    sales   and   technical    staff   to   provide
comprehensive  marketing  and service  tailored  to the  particular
sales and  technical  support  requirements  of the dealers and the
end  users   the  company  conducts   extensive   distributor  and
enduser marketing  programs and trains laboratory  technicians and
dentists  in the proper use of its  products  introducing  them to
the latest  technological  developments at its educational  centers
located  throughout  the world in key dental  markets  the company
also   maintains   ongoing   relationships   with  various   dental
associations  and  recognized  worldwide  opinion  leaders  in  the
dental field

   dentsply  believes that demand in a given geographic  market for
dental  procedures  and products  varies  according to the stage of
social  economic  and  technical  development  that the market has
attained  geographic  markets for dentsplys  dental  products can
be categorized into the following three stages of development

   the united states  canada  western europe the united kingdom
japan and australia are highly  developed  markets that demand the
most advanced  dental  procedures and products and have the highest
level of expenditures  on dental care in these markets  the focus
of  dental  care  is   increasingly   upon   preventive   care  and
specialized  dentistry  in  addition to basic  procedures  such as
the  excavation  and filling of cavities and tooth  extraction  and
denture  replacement  dental  professionals  perform an increasing
volume  of  preventive  and  cosmetic  procedures   these  markets
require varied and complex dental products  utilize  sophisticated
diagnostic  and  imaging  equipment  and  demand  high  levels  of
attention   to   protection    against    infection   and   patient
crosscontamination

   in certain  countries in central america  south america and the
pacific rim  dental care is often  limited to the  excavation  and
filling of cavities and other  restorative  techniques  reflecting
more  modest  per  capita   expenditures  for  dental  care  these
markets  demand  diverse  products  such  as  high  and  low  speed
handpieces  restorative  compounds  finishing  devices and custom
restorative devices

   in the peoples republic of china  india  eastern europe  the
countries  of  the  former  soviet  union   and  other  developing
countries  dental  ailments are treated  primarily  through  tooth
extraction  and  denture  replacement   these  procedures  require
basic  surgical  instruments  artificial  teeth for  dentures  and
bridgework

   the company offers  products and equipment for use in markets at
each of these stages of development  the company  believes that as
each  of  these  markets  develop   demand  for  more  technically
advanced  products  will  increase  the company also believes that
its recognized brand names  high quality and innovative  products
technical  support services and strong  international  distribution
capabilities   position   it  well  to   take   advantage   of  any
opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

   the  company  believes  that the  following  trends  support the
companys confidence in its industry growth outlook

o     increasing worldwide population

o     growth of the  population 65 or older  the percentage of the
   united states  european and japanese  population over age 65 is
   expected  to nearly  double by the year  2030  in  addition  to
   having  significant  needs for dental care the elderly are well
   positioned  to  pay  for  the  required  procedures  since  they
   control sizable amounts of discretionary income

o     natural teeth are being  retained  longer  individuals  with
   natural  teeth  are much more  likely  to visit a  dentist  in a
   given year than those without any natural teeth remaining

o     the  changing  dental  practice  in the us   dentistry  in
   north america has been transformed  from a profession  primarily
   dealing  with  pain  infections  and  tooth  decay  to one with
   increased emphasis on preventive care and cosmetic dentistry
o     per  capita  and  discretionary  incomes  are  increasing  in
   emerging  nations  as personal  incomes continue to rise in the
   emerging   nations  of  the  pacific  rim  and  latin   america
   healthcare including dental services are a growing priority

o     the  companys   business  is  less  susceptible  than  other
   industries  to general  downturns  in the  economies in which it
   operates  many of the  products  the company  offers  relate to
   dental  procedures  that are  considered  necessary  by patients
   regardless of the economic environment

product development

   technological  innovation and successful product development are
critical  to  strengthening  the  companys  prominent  position in
worldwide dental markets  maintaining its leadership  positions in
product   categories   where  it  has  a  high  market  share  and
increasing  market  share in  product  categories  where  gains are
possible   while   many  of   dentsplys   innovations   represent
sequential  improvements  of existing  products  the company  also
continues  to   successfully   launch   products   that   represent
fundamental  change  its  research  centers  throughout  the world
employ  approximately  400  scientists   phds   engineers  and
technicians   dedicated  to  research   and  product   development
approximately  433  million  399  million  and 273 million
respectively   was   internally   invested   by  the   company  in
connection  with  the  development  of  new  products  and  in  the
improvement  of existing  products  in the years ended 2003  2002
and 2001  respectively  there can be no assurance  that  dentsply
will be able to continue to develop  innovative  products  and that
regulatory  approval of any new products will be obtained  or that
if such  approvals are obtained  such products will be accepted in
the   marketplace   additionally   there  is  no  assurance  that
entirely new  technology  or approaches  to dental  treatment  will
not be introduced that could obsolete the companys products


operating and technical expertise

   dentsply  believes  that  its  manufacturing   capabilities  are
important  to  its  success   the  manufacture  of  the  companys
products  requires  substantial  and  varied  technical  expertise
complex  materials   technology  and  processes  are  necessary  to
manufacture  the  companys   productsthe   company  continues  to
automate its global  manufacturing  operations in order to remain a
low cost producer



page


    dentsply  has  completed  or has in  progress  a number  of key
initiatives  around  the world  that are  focused  on  helping  the
company improve its operating margins


o     the  company  is  constructing  a  major  dental   anesthetic
   filling plant  outside  chicago  the company  believes that the
   plant will become  operational  late in 2004  following the fda
   validation  of  manufacturing  practices  at which time it will
   begin to supply products to certain international  markets this
   initiative  is very  important  to the company  since the assets
   acquired   from   astrazeneca   did   not   include   production
   facilities  the  company  has a contract  with  astrazeneca  to
   produce the  companys  requirements  at their  facilities  on a
   contract  manufacturing  basis  pending  the  completion  of the
   companys  manufacturing  facility  in  chicago  illinois  the
   contract with  astrazeneca  has recently been  renegotiated  and
   extended to march 2005  with  further  extensions  available to
   the  company  with  six  months  advance  notice  based  on the
   current  contract   manufacturing   arrangement  in  place  the
   company  believes that it has  sufficient  sources of supply and
   contractual  flexibility to ensure a continued  source of supply
   until the facilities in chicago are completed

o     a  corporate   purchasing  office  has  been  established  to
   leverage  the  buying  power of  dentsply  around  the world and
   reduce our  product  costs  through  lower  prices  and  reduced
   related overhead

o     the company has centralized its warehousing and  distribution
   in north  america and europe  while the initial gains from this
   strategy  have been  realized  ongoing  efforts are in place to
   maximize  additional  opportunities  that can be gained  through
   improving our functional  expertise in supply chain  management
   in an effort to  improve  customer  service  levels  and  reduce
   costs  the company is  currently  in the process of  relocating
   its  european  warehouse  form  nijmegen   the  netherlands  to
   radolfzell  germany this relocation is expected to be complete
   by the first quarter of 2004

o     a   corporate   quality   group  is  focused   on   improving
   manufacturing and distribution  processes throughout the company
   with a goal to eliminate  nonvalue added activities  improving
   product quality and expanding product margins

o     dentsply has seen  significant  gains from the formation of a
   north american shared services group  the company is evaluating
   the possible efficiency  opportunities  related to consolidating
   accounting and finance processes within europe

o     information    technology   initiatives   are   underway   to
   standardize  worldwide  telecommunications  implement  improved
   manufacturing  and financial  accounting  systems and an ongoing
   training  of it users to  maximize  the  capabilities  of global
   systems

o     dentsply  continues to pursue  opportunities  to leverage its
   assets by consolidating  business units where appropriate and to
   optimize its diversity of worldwide manufacturing capabilities

financing

   dentsplys  longterm  debt at  december  31  2003  was  7902
million  and the ratio of  longterm  debt to total  capitalization
was  413  this  capitalization  ratio  is  down  from  543  at
december  31  2001  the  quarter  in  which  the  degussa  dental
acquisition  was completed  dentsply may incur  additional debt in
the future  including the funding of additional  acquisitions  and
capital  expenditures  dentsplys  ability to make payments on its
indebtedness  and to fund its  operations  depends  on its  future
performance  and financial  results  which  to a certain  extent
are   subject  to   general   economic   financial   competitive
regulatory   and  other   factors  that  are  beyond  its  control
although  the  management  believes  that the  company has and will
continue to have  sufficient  liquidity  there can be no assurance
that  dentsplys  business will generate  sufficient cash flow from
operations  in the  future  to  service  its debt and  operate  its
business

   dentsplys  existing borrowing  documentation  contains a number
of  covenants  and  financial   ratios  which  it  is  required  to
satisfy  any breach of any such  covenants or  restrictions  would
result in a  default  under the  existing  borrowing  documentation
that would  permit the  lenders to  declare  all  borrowings  under
such  documentation  to be immediately due and payable and through
cross default  provisions  would entitle  dentsplys other lenders
to  accelerate  their  loans  dentsply may not be able to meet its
obligations  under its  outstanding  indebtedness in the event that
any cross default provision is triggered

competition

   the company conducts its operations  both domestic and foreign
under highly  competitive  market  conditions  competition  in the
dental   products   industry  is  based   primarily   upon  product
performance  quality  safety  and ease of use  as well as price
customer  service  innovation and acceptance by professionals  and
technicians   dentsply  believes  that  its  principal   strengths
include  its  wellestablished  brand  names  its  reputation  for
highquality  and  innovative  products  its leadership in product
development  and  manufacturing  and its  commitment  to  customer
service and technical support

   the  size  and  number  of the  companys  competitors  vary  by
product  line and from region to region  there are many  companies
that  produce  some  but not all of the same types of products as
those  produced by the company  certain of dentsplys  competitors
may have  greater  resources  than does the  company  in certain of
its product offerings

   the   worldwide   market   for   dental   supplies   is   highly
competitive  there  can be no  assurance  that  the  company  will
successfully  identify  new product  opportunities  and develop and
market  new  products  successfully   or  that  new  products  and
technologies   introduced  by  competitors   will  not  render  the
companys products obsolete or noncompetitive

regulation

   the  companys  products  are subject to  regulation  by  among
other  governmental  entities  the  united  states  food  and drug
administration  the fda  in general  if a dental  device is
subject to fda regulation  compliance with the fdas  requirements
constitutes  compliance with corresponding  state  regulations  in
order to ensure that dental  products  distributed for human use in
the united  states are safe and  effective  the fda  regulates the
introduction   manufacture   advertising   labeling  packaging
marketing  and  distribution  of  and  recordkeeping   for  such
products   the  anesthetic   products  sold  by  the  company  are
regulated  as  a  drug  by  the  fda  and  by  all  other   similar
regulatory agencies around the world

   dental  devices  of the types  sold by  dentsply  are  generally
classified  by the fda into a category  that  renders  them subject
only  to  general  controls  that  apply  to all  medical  devices
including   regulations    regarding    alteration    misbranding
notification  recordkeeping  and  good  manufacturing  practices
dentsplys  facilities  are subject to periodic  inspection  by the
fda  to  monitor  dentsplys  compliance  with  these  regulations
there can be no  assurance  that the fda will not raise  compliance
concerns  failure to satisfy  fda  requirements  can result in fda
enforcement actions  including product seizure  injunction andor
criminal or civil  proceedings  in the european union  dentsplys
products  are  subject to the medical  devices  laws of the various
member  states  which  are  based on a  directive  of the  european
commission   such  laws  generally  regulate  the  safety  of  the
products  in  a  similar  way  to  the  fda  regulations  dentsply
products  in europe  bear the ce sign  showing  that such  products
adhere to the european regulations

   all  dental   amalgam   filling   materials   including   those
manufactured  and  sold  by  dentsply   contain  mercury  various
groups have  alleged  that  dental  amalgam  containing  mercury is
harmful  to  human  health  and have  actively  lobbied  state  and
federal  lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt  regulatory
changes  restricting  the  use  or  requiring  a  warning  against
alleged  potential  risks  of dental  amalgams  the fdas  dental
devices  classification  panel  the national  institutes of health
and the united  states public  health  service have each  indicated
that no direct  hazard to humans from  exposure to dental  amalgams
has  been  demonstrated  if the  fda  were  to  reclassify  dental
mercury  and  amalgam  filling  materials  as classes  of  products
requiring fda premarket  approval  there can be no assurance that
the  required  approval  would be  obtained  or that the fda  would
permit the  continued  sale of amalgam  filling  materials  pending
its  determination  in europe  in particular in  scandinavia  and
germany  the contents of mercury in amalgam filling  materials has
been the subject of public  discussion  as a consequence  in 1994
the  german  health   authorities   required  suppliers  of  dental
amalgam  to amend  the  instructions  for use for  amalgam  filling
materials  to include a precaution  against the use of amalgam for
children under  eighteen years of age and to women of  childbearing
age  dentsply  also  manufactures  and  sells  nonamalgam  dental
filling materials that do not contain mercury

produced by the company are also subject to  government  regulation
in the  various  foreign  countries  in which they are  produced or
sold  dentsply believes that it is in substantial  compliance with
the foreign  regulatory  requirements  that are  applicable  to its
products and manufacturing operations


sources and supply of raw materials

of its  products  are  purchased  from  various  suppliers  and are

   dentsplys  policy is to protect  its  products  and  technology
through  patents and trademark  registrations  in the united states
and in  significant  international  markets for its  products  the
company carefully  monitors  trademark use worldwide  and promotes
enforcement  of its  patents  and  trademarks  in a manner  that is
designed to balance the cost of such protection  against  obtaining
the  greatest  value  for  the  company   dentsply   believes  its
patents and trademark  properties  are important and  contribute to
the  companys  marketing  position  but it does not  consider  its
overall  business to be materially  dependent  upon any  individual
patent or trademark

item 3  legal proceedings

   dentsply and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to
lawsuits arising out of their respective operations  the company
believes it is remote that pending litigation to which dentsply
is a party will have a material adverse effect upon its
consolidated financial position or results of operations

   in june  1995  the  antitrust  division  of the  united  states
department   of  justice   initiated  an  antitrust   investigation
regarding  the policies  and conduct  undertaken  by the  companys
trubyte  division  with respect to the  distribution  of artificial
teeth and related  products  on january 5 1999 the  department of
justice  filed  a  complaint   against  the  company  in  the  us
district   court  in   wilmington   delaware   alleging  that  the
companys tooth  distribution  practices violate the antitrust laws
and   seeking  an  order  for  the  company  to   discontinue   its
practices  the  trial in the  governments  case was held in april
and may 2002  on august  14  2003  the judge  entered a decision
that the  companys  tooth  distribution  practices  do not violate
the  antitrust  laws  on  october  14  2003  the  department  of
justice  appealed this decision to the us  third circuit court of
appeals  the parties are  proceeding  under the briefing  schedule
issued by the third circuit

   subsequent to the filing of the department of justice  complaint
in 1999  several  private  party class actions were filed based on
allegations  similar to those in the  department  of justice  case
on  behalf of  laboratories  and  denture  patients  in  seventeen
states who purchased trubyte teeth or products  containing  trubyte
teeth  these cases were transferred to the us  district court in
wilmington  delaware  the private  party suits seek damages in an
unspecified  amount  the court has  granted the  companys  motion
on the  lack  of  standing  of the  laboratory  and  patient  class
actions  to  pursue   damage   claims   the   plaintiffs   in  the
laboratory  case have  filed a petition  with the third  circuit to
hear an  interlocutory  appeal  of  this  decision  also  private
party  class  actions on behalf of indirect  purchasers  were filed
in  california  and  florida  state  courts   the  california  and
florida cases have been dismissed by the  plaintiffs  following the
decision  by the  federal  district  court  judge  issued in august
2003

   on march 27 2002 a complaint was filed in alameda county
california which was transferred to los angeles county by bruce
glover dds alleging inter alia breach of express and
implied warranties fraud unfair trade practices and negligent
misrepresentation in the companys manufacture and sale of
advancer cement  the complaint seeks damages in an unspecified
amount for costs incurred in repairing dental work in which the
advancer product allegedly failed  in september 2003 the
plaintiff filed a motion for class certification which the
company opposed  oral arguments were held in december 2003 and
in january 2004 the judge entered an order granting class
certification only on the claims of breach of warranty and
fraud  in general the class is defined as california dentists
who purchased and used advancer cement and were required because
of failures of advancer to repair or reperform dental
procedures  the company has filed a writ of mandate in the
appellate court seeking reversal of the class certification  the
advancer cement product was sold from 1994 through 2000 and total
sales in the united states during that period were approximately
52 million

   dentsply believes that the dental products industry is experiencing
substantial consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and
distribution although it continues to be fragmented creating numerous
acquisition opportunities as a result during the past three years the
company has made numerous acquisitions including three significant
acquisitions made during 2001 in january 2001 the company acquired the
outstanding shares of friadent gmbh friadent a global dental implant
manufacturer and marketer previously headquartered in mannheim germany in
march 2001 the company acquired the dental injectible anaesthetic assets of
astrazeneca az assets in october 2001 the company acquired the degussa
dental group degussa dental a manufacturer and seller of dental
products including precious metal alloys ceramics dental laboratory
equipment and chairside products previously headquartered in hanau germany
information about these acquisitions and the other acquisition and
divestiture activities is set forth in note 3 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements in the companys 2002 annual report to shareholders and
is incorporated herein by reference  these acquisitions are intended to
supplement dentsplys core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its
business in addition acquisitions continue to provide dentsply with new
technologies and additional product breadth

   certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and of delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third
party to acquire control of dentsply such provisions include the division
of the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the
threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision allowing the
board of directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of
the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult
for stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and which preclude stockholders
from calling special meetings of stockholders in addition members of
dentsplys management and participants in its employee stock ownership plan
collectively own approximately 10 of the outstanding common stock of
dentsply which may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire
control of dentsply in a transaction that is opposed by dentsplys
management and employees

markets sales and distribution

   dentsply  distributes  approximately  60 of its  dental  products  through
domestic and foreign  distributors  dealers and importers  however  certain
highly  technical  products  such as  precious  metal  dental  alloys  dental
ceramics  crown and bridge  porcelain  products  endodontic  instruments and
materials  orthodontic appliances  implants and bone substitute and grafting
materials  are sold  directly  to the  dental  laboratory  or  dentist in some
markets  no  customers  accounted  for more than ten percent of  consolidated
net sales in 2002

   the  information  about the companys  foreign and domestic  operations and
export  sales  set  forth  in note 4 of the  notes to  consolidated  financial
statements  in  the  companys   2002  annual   report  to   shareholders   is
incorporated herein by reference

   although  much  of  its  sales  are  made  to  distributors  dealers  and
importers  dentsply  focuses its marketing  efforts on the  dentists  dental
hygienists  dental  assistants  dental  laboratories  and dental schools who
are the end users of its  products  as part of this enduser  pull  through
marketing  approach  dentsply  employs  approximately  1700 highly  trained
productspecific   sales  and   technical   staff  to  provide   comprehensive
marketing and service tailored to the particular  sales and technical  support
requirements  of  the  dealers  and  the  end  users   the  company  conducts
extensive  distributor and enduser  marketing  programs and trains laboratory
technicians and dentists in the proper use of its products  introducing  them
to the latest  technological  developments at its educational  centers located
in key dental  markets  the  company  also  maintains  ongoing  relationships
with various dental  associations and recognized  worldwide opinion leaders in
the dental field

   dentsply  believes  that  demand in a given  geographic  market  for dental
procedures  and products  varies  according  to the stage of social  economic
and technical  development  that the market has attained  geographic  markets
for dentsplys  dental  products can be categorized  into the following  three
stages of development

   the united states canada  western europe the united kingdom  japan and
australia are highly  developed  markets that demand the most advanced  dental
procedures and products and have the highest level of  expenditures  on dental
care  in  these  markets  the  focus of  dental  care is  increasingly  upon
preventive care and  specialized  dentistry  in addition to basic  procedures
such as the  excavation  and  filling of  cavities  and tooth  extraction  and
denture  replacement  dental  professionals  perform an increasing  volume of
preventive  and  cosmetic   procedures   these  markets  require  varied  and
complex  dental  products   utilize  sophisticated   diagnostic  and  imaging
equipment   and  demand  high  levels  of  attention  to  protection  against
infection and patient crosscontamination

   in certain  countries  in central  america  south  america and the pacific
rim  dental care is often limited to the  excavation  and filling of cavities
and  other   restorative   techniques   reflecting  more  modest  per  capita
expenditures  for dental care  these markets demand diverse  products such as
high and low speed handpieces  restorative  compounds  finishing devices and
custom restorative devices

   in the peoples  republic of china  india  eastern europe  the countries
of the former soviet union  and other developing  countries  dental ailments
are treated  primarily  through  tooth  extraction  and  denture  replacement
these  procedures  require basic surgical  instruments  artificial  teeth for
dentures and bridgework and anchoring devices such as posts

   the company  offers  products and  equipment  for use in markets at each of
these  stages  of  development  the  company  believes  that as each of these
markets  develop   demand  for  more  technically   advanced   products  will
increase  the company also believes  that its  recognized  brand names  high
quality  and  innovative  products  technical  support  services  and  strong
international  distribution  capabilities  position it well to take  advantage
of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

confidence in its industry growth outlook

o     increasing   worldwide   population     population   growth   continues
   throughout the world

o     growth of the  population  65 or older  the  percentage  of the  united
   states  european  and  japanese  population  over  age 65 is  expected  to
   nearly  double by the year 2030  in addition to having  significant  needs
   for dental care  the elderly are well  positioned  to pay for the required
   procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary income

o     natural  teeth are being  retained  longer   individuals  with  natural
   teeth are much more  likely to visit a dentist  in a given  year than those
   without any natural teeth remaining

o     the changing  dental  practice in the us  dentistry in north  america
   has  been  transformed  from a  profession  primarily  dealing  with  pain
   infections  and tooth decay to one with  increased  emphasis on  preventive
   care and cosmetic dentistry

o     per capita and discretionary  incomes are increasing in emerging nations
    as  personal  incomes  continue  to rise in the  emerging  nations of the
   pacific rim and latin america  healthcare  including dental services are
   a growing priority

o     the  companys  business is less  susceptible  than other  industries to
   general  downturns  in the  economies  in  which it  operates  many of the
   products  the  company  offers  relate  to  dental   procedures   that  are
   considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment

product development

   technological  innovation and successful  product  development are critical
to  strengthening  the  companys   prominent  position  in  worldwide  dental
markets  maintaining its leadership  positions in product categories where it
has a high market share  and  increasing  market share in product  categories
where  gains are  possible  while many of  dentsplys  innovations  represent
sequential  improvements of existing  products  the company also continues to
successfully  launch products that represent  fundamental change its research

will be able to continue to develop  innovative  products and that  regulatory
approval of any new products will be obtained  or that if such  approvals are
obtained such products will be accepted in the marketplace

   dentsply  believes  that its  manufacturing  capabilities  are important to
its  success  the  company  continues  to automate  its global  manufacturing
operations in order to remain a low cost producer

technical   expertise   complex   materials   technology  and  processes  are
necessary to manufacture the companys products

around  the  world  that are  focused  on  helping  the  company  improve  its
operating margins

   fda  validation  of  the  manufacturing  practices  and  the  provision  of
   products  to  certain  international   markets  this  initiative  is  very
   important  to  the  company  since   astrazeneca   the  companys  current
   supplier  will  cease to supply  product to  certain  markets by  yearend
   2004  as a result  this plant must be  operational  prior to that time to
   avoid any disruption in supply

   buying  power of  dentsply  around the world and reduce our  product  costs
   through lower prices and reduced related overhead

o     the company has centralized  its  warehousing and  distribution in north
   america and europe  while the initial  gains from this  strategy have been
   realized   ongoing   efforts   are  in   place  to   maximize   additional
   opportunities   that  can  be  gained  through   improving  our  functional
   expertise in supply chain management

o     a corporate  quality  group is focused on  improving  manufacturing  and
   distribution  processes  throughout  the company  with a goal to  eliminate
   nonvalue  added  activities   improving  product  quality  and  expanding
   product margins

   american shared  services  group  the company has established a task force
   to assess possible efficiency  opportunities  related to the accounting and
   finance processes within europe

o     information   technology   initiatives   are  underway  to   standardize

financing

   dentsplys  longterm  debt at december 31 2002 was 7698 million and the
ratio of  longterm  debt to total  capitalization  was  479  dentsply  may
incur  additional  debt in the future  including  the  funding of  additional
acquisitions  and capital  expenditures  dentsplys  ability to make payments
on  its  indebtedness  and to  fund  its  operations  depends  on its  future
performance and financial  results  which  to a certain extent  are subject
to general  economic  financial  competitive  regulatory  and other factors
that are  beyond  its  control  although  the  management  believes  that the
company has and will continue to have  sufficient  liquidity  there can be no
assurance that  dentsplys  business will generate  sufficient  cash flow from
operations in the future to service its debt and operate its business

   dentsplys   existing   borrowing   documentation   contains  a  number  of
covenants  and  financial  ratios which it is required to satisfy  any breach
of any such  covenants or  restrictions  would  result in a default  under the
existing  borrowing  documentation  that would  permit the  lenders to declare
all borrowings  under such  documentation  to be  immediately  due and payable
and  through  cross  default  provisions   would  entitle  dentsplys  other
lenders  to  accelerate  their  loans  dentsply  may not be able to meet  its
obligations  under its  outstanding  indebtedness  in the event that any cross
default provision is triggered

competition

   the company  conducts its  operations  both  domestic  and foreign  under
highly  competitive  market  conditions  competition  in the dental  products
industry is based  primarily  upon product  performance  quality  safety and
ease of use as well as price  customer  service  innovation  and acceptance
by  professionals  and  technicians  dentsply  believes  that  its  principal
strengths  include  its  wellestablished  brand  names  its  reputation  for
highquality and innovative  products  its leadership in product  development
and  manufacturing  and its  commitment  to customer  service  and  technical
support

   the size and number of the companys  competitors  vary by product line and
from region to region  there are many  companies  that produce some  but not
all  of the  same  types  of  products  as  those  produced  by the  company
certain of dentsplys  competitors  may have greater  resources  than does the
company in certain of its product offerings

   the  worldwide   market  for  dental   supplies  and  equipment  is  highly
competitive  there can be no  assurance  that the company  will  successfully
identify  new  product  opportunities  and  develop  and market  new  products
successfully   or  that  new  products   and   technologies   introduced   by
competitors   will   not   render   the   companys   products   obsolete   or
noncompetitive

regulation

   the  companys   products  are  subject  to  regulation   by  among  other
governmental  entities  the united states food and drug  administration  the
fda  in  general  if a dental  device  is  subject  to fda  regulation
compliance   with  the  fdas   requirements   constitutes   compliance   with
corresponding  state  regulations  in order to ensure  that  dental  products
distributed  for human use in the united  states are safe and  effective  the
fda   regulates  the   introduction   manufacture   advertising   labeling
packaging  marketing  and  distribution  of  and  recordkeeping  for  such
products  the  anesthetic  products  sold by the company are  regulated  as a
drug  by the fda and by all  other  similar  regulatory  agencies  around  the
world

   dental  devices of the types sold by dentsply are  generally  classified by
the fda into a category  that renders  them  subject only to general  controls
that  apply  to  all  medical   devices   including   regulations   regarding
alteration misbranding  notification  recordkeeping and good manufacturing
practices  dentsplys  facilities  are subject to periodic  inspection by the
fda to monitor dentsplys  compliance with these regulations  there can be no
assurance  that  the fda  will  not  raise  compliance  concerns  failure  to
satisfy fda  requirements  can result in fda  enforcement  actions  including
product  seizure  injunction  andor  criminal or civil  proceedings  in the
european  union  dentsplys  products are subject to the medical devices laws
of the various  member  states  which are based on a directive of the european
commission  such laws  generally  regulate  the safety of the  products  in a
similar way to the fda  regulations  dentsply  products in europe bear the ce
sign showing that such products adhere to the european regulations

   all dental amalgam  filling  materials  including those  manufactured  and
sold by dentsply  contain  mercury  various  groups have alleged that dental
amalgam  containing  mercury  is harmful  to human  health  and have  actively
lobbied  state and  federal  lawmakers  and  regulators  to pass laws or adopt
regulatory  changes  restricting  the use  or  requiring  a  warning  against
alleged  potential  risks  of  dental  amalgams  the  fdas  dental  devices
classification  panel  the  national  institutes  of  health  and the  united
states  public  health  service have each  indicated  that no direct hazard to
humans from  exposure to dental  amalgams  has been  demonstrated  if the fda
were to reclassify  dental  mercury and amalgam  filling  materials as classes
of products  requiring  fda  premarket  approval  there can be no  assurance
that the  required  approval  would be obtained  or that the fda would  permit
the continued sale of amalgam  filling  materials  pending its  determination
in europe  in particular in scandinavia and germany  the contents of mercury
in amalgam filling materials has been the subject of public  discussion  as a
consequence  in 1994 the german  health  authorities  required  suppliers  of
dental  amalgam  to  amend  the  instructions  for  use  for  amalgam  filling
materials  to include a  precaution  against the use of amalgam for  children
under eighteen years of age and to women of  childbearing  age  dentsply also
manufactures  and  sells  nonamalgam  dental  filling  materials  that do not
contain mercury

   the  introduction  and sale of dental products of the types produced by the
company are also  subject to  government  regulation  in the  various  foreign
countries  in  which  they are  produced  or  sold  some of these  regulatory
requirements  are more stringent  than those  applicable in the united states
dentsply  believes  that it is in  substantial  compliance  with  the  foreign
regulatory   requirements   that   are   applicable   to  its   products   and
manufacturing operations

products  are  purchased  from  various   suppliers  and  are  available  from
numerous  sources  no single  supplier  except for the  supplier of precious
metal raw materials  accounts for a significant  percentage of dentsplys raw
material  requirements  there are alternative suppliers of precious metal raw

trademarks  and trade names  dentsply also owns and maintains more than 1000
patents  throughout  the world and is licensed under a small number of patents
owned by others

   dentsplys  policy  is to  protect  its  products  and  technology  through
patents and trademark  registrations  in the united states and in  significant
international  markets  for  its  products  the  company  carefully  monitors
trademark  use  worldwide   and  promotes  enforcement  of  its  patents  and
trademarks  in a  manner  that  is  designed  to  balance  the  cost  of  such
protection  against  obtaining  the greatest  value for the company  dentsply
believes its patents and trademark  properties  are  important and  contribute
to the  companys  marketing  position  but it does not  consider  its overall
business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark

believes that its relationship with its employees is good

   the  companys  success is dependent  upon its  management  and  employees
the loss of senior  management  employees  or any failure to recruit and train
needed  managerial  sales  and  technical  personnel  could  have a  material
adverse effect on the company

environmental matters

   dentsply  believes  that its  operations  comply in all  material  respects
with applicable  environmental  laws and  regulations  maintaining this level
of compliance  has not had and is not expected to have a material  effect on
the companys capital expenditures or on its business

certain of its foreign and domestic  manufacturing  facilities  as well as at
various  other  united  states  and  international  locations   most  of  the

used




item 3  legal proceedings

   dentsply and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
arising out of their respective operations  the company believes it is
remote that pending litigation to which dentsply is a party will have a
material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position or results
of operations

   in june 1995 the antitrust division of the united states department of
justice initiated an antitrust investigation regarding the policies and
conduct undertaken by the companys trubyte division with respect to the
distribution of artificial teeth and related products  on january 5 1999
the department of justice filed a complaint against the company in the us
district court in wilmington delaware alleging that the companys tooth
distribution practices violate the antitrust laws and seeking an order for
the company to discontinue its practices  three follow on private class
action suits on behalf of dentists laboratories and denture patients in
seventeen states respectively who purchased trubyte teeth or products
containing trubyte teeth were filed and transferred to the us district
court in wilmington delaware  the class action filed on behalf of the
dentists has been dismissed by the plaintiffs  the private party suits seek
damages in an unspecified amount  the court has granted the companys
motion on the lack of standing of the laboratory and patient class actions
to pursue damage claims  four private party class actions on behalf of
indirect purchasers were filed in california state court  these cases are
based on allegations similar to those in the department of justice case  in
response to the companys motion these cases have been consolidated in one
judicial district in los angeles  a similar private party action has been
filed in florida  the trial in the governments case was held in april and
may 2002 the posttrial briefing  occurred during the summer and the final
arguments were made in september of 2002  the case is pending a decision by
the federal district court judge who heard the case  it is the companys
position that the conduct and activities of the trubyte division do not
violate the antitrust laws

   dentsply believes that the dental products industry is
experiencing substantial consolidation with respect to both
product manufacturing and distribution although it continues
to be fragmented between january 1999 and december 2001
dentsply completed nine acquisitions five in 2000 and four in
2001 the activity in 2001 includes three significant
acquisitions in january 2001 the company acquired the
outstanding shares of friadent gmbh friadent a global
dental implant manufacturer and marketer headquartered in
mannheim germany in march 2001 the company acquired the
dental injectible anaesthetic assets of astrazeneca az
assets in october 2001 the company acquired the degussa
dental group degussa dental a manufacturer and seller of
dental products including precious metal alloys ceramics
dental laboratory equipment and chairside products
headquartered in hanau germany information about these
acquisitions and the other acquisition and divestiture
activities is set forth in note 3 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements in the companys 2001 annual report to
shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference  these
acquisitions are intended to supplement dentsplys core growth
and assure ongoing expansion of its business in addition
acquisitions continue to provide dentsply with new technologies
and additional product breadth

   the acquisitions made by dentsply involve a substantial
degree of risk they are expected to result in benefits to
dentsply including expanding the products and services offered
by dentsply to its customers and potential customers and
enhancing dentsplys presence in the european and japanese
market for dental products achieving the benefits of the
acquisitions however will depend on a number of factors
including the integration of the operations and personnel of
dentsply and the acquired companies in a timely and efficient
manner the integration will be complicated by the need to
integrate geographically diverse operations in general
dentsply cannot offer any assurances that it can successfully
integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of the
acquisitions failure to do so could result in the loss of key
personnel and have a material adverse effect on the acquired
businesses and dentsplys financial condition and operating
results in addition the attention and effort devoted to the
integration of the acquired companies could significantly
divert managements attention from other important tasks and
could seriously harm dentsply other risks include
unanticipated expenses related to technology integration
difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls
procedures and policies the impairment of relationships with
employees and customers as a result of any integration of new
management personnel and potential unknown liabilities
associated with acquired businesses

   certain provisions of dentsplys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could have the
effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire
control of dentsply such provisions include the division of
the board of directors of dentsply into three classes with the
threeyear term of a class expiring each year a provision
allowing the board of directors to issue preferred stock having
rights senior to those of the common stock and certain
procedural requirements which make it difficult for
stockholders to amend dentsplys bylaws and which preclude
stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders in
addition members of dentsplys management and participants in
its employee stock ownership plan collectively own
approximately 11 of the outstanding common stock of dentsply
which may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire
control of dentsply in a transaction that is opposed by
dentsplys management and employees

   the  information  about the  companys  foreign  and  domestic
operations  and export  sales set forth in note 4 of the notes to
consolidated  financial  statements in the companys  2001 annual
report to shareholders is incorporated herein by reference

   although   much  of  its  sales  are  made  to   distributors
dealers  and importers  dentsply focuses its marketing  efforts
on the dentists  dental hygienists  dental  assistants  dental
laboratories  and  dental  schools  who are the end  users of its
products  as part  of this  enduser  pull  through  marketing
approach  dentsply employs  approximately  1700 highly trained
productspecific   sales   and   technical   staff   to   provide
comprehensive  marketing and service  tailored to the  particular
sales and technical  support  requirements of the dealers and the
end  users  the  company  conducts  extensive   distributor  and
enduser  marketing  programs and trains  laboratory  technicians
and  dentists  in the  proper  use of its  products  introducing
them   to   the   latest   technological   developments   at  its
educational  centers located in key dental  markets  the company
also  maintains   ongoing   relationships   with  various  dental
associations  and  recognized  worldwide  opinion  leaders in the
dental field

   dentsply  believes  that demand in a given  geographic  market
for  dental  procedures  and  products  varies  according  to the
stage of social  economic  and  technical  development  that the
market has attained  geographic  markets for  dentsplys  dental
products can be  categorized  into the following  three stages of
development

   the  united  states   canada   western  europe  the  united
kingdom  japan and australia are highly developed  markets that
demand the most  advanced  dental  procedures  and  products  and
have the highest  level of  expenditure  on dental care in these
markets   the  focus  of  dental  care  is   increasingly   upon
preventive care and specialized  dentistry  in addition to basic
procedures  such as the  excavation  and filling of cavities  and
tooth extraction and denture  replacement  dental  professionals
perform  an  increasing   volume  of   preventive   and  cosmetic
procedures  these  markets  require  varied and  complex  dental
products    utilize   sophisticated   diagnostic   and   imaging
equipment  and demand high  levels of  attention  to  protection
against infection and patient crosscontamination

   in certain  countries in central  america  south  america and
the pacific rim  dental care is often limited to the  excavation
and  filling  of  cavities  and  other  restorative   techniques
reflecting more modest per capita  expenditures  for dental care
these  markets  demand  diverse  products  such as  high  and low
speed handpieces  restorative  compounds  finishing devices and
custom restorative devices

   in the  peoples  republic of china  india  eastern  europe
the countries of the former soviet  union  and other  developing
countries  dental ailments are treated  primarily  through tooth
extraction  and denture  replacement  these  procedures  require
basic  surgical  instruments  artificial  teeth for dentures and
bridgework and anchoring devices such as posts

   the company  offers  products and equipment for use in markets
at each of these  stages of  development  the  company  believes
that  as  each  of  these  markets   develop   demand  for  more
technically  advanced  products will  increase  the company also
believes  that its  recognized  brand  names  high  quality  and
innovative  products   technical  support  services  and  strong
international  distribution  capabilities  position  it  well  to
take  advantage  of any  opportunities  for  growth in all of the
markets that it serves

   the following  trends support the companys  confidence in its
industry growth outlook

o     increasing   worldwide   population    population   growth
   continues throughout the world

o     growth of the  population  65 or older  the  percentage of
   the  united  states  and  european  population  over age 65 is
   expected  to nearly  double by the year 2030  in  addition to
   having  significant  needs for dental  care  the  elderly are
   well  positioned  to pay for  the  required  procedures  since
   they control sizable amounts of discretionary income

o     natural teeth are being retained longer  individuals  with
   natural  teeth  are much more  likely to visit a dentist  in a
   given year than those without any natural teeth remaining

o     the  changing  dental  practice  in  developed  countries 
   dentistry in developed  countries has been  transformed from a
   profession  primarily dealing with pain  infections and tooth
   decay to one with  increased  emphasis on preventive  care and
   cosmetic   dentistry   dentsplys   product  lines  are  well
   positioned  to provide the new  sophisticated  solutions  that
   these advanced procedures require

o     per capita and  discretionary  incomes  are  increasing  in
   emerging  nations  as  personal  incomes  continue to rise in
   the  emerging  nations of the pacific  rim and latin  america
   healthcare   including   dental   services   are  a  growing
   priority

o     growth in the field of  aesthetic  dentistry   those among
   the  aging  baby  boomer  population  are not  only  keeping
   their  natural  teeth  longer  but are  interested  in looking
   their  best  increasing  the demand for tooth  whitening  and
   other aesthetic procedures

product development

are critical to strengthening  the companys  prominent  position
in  worldwide   dental   markets   maintaining   its  leadership
positions  in  product  categories  where  it has a  high  market
share  and increasing  market share in product  categories where
gains  are  possible   while  many  of  dentsplys   innovations
represent  sequential  improvements  of  existing  products  the
company  also  continues to  successfully  launch  products  that
represent  fundamental  change  its research centers  throughout
the  world  employ   approximately   330   scientists   phds

company in connection  with the  development  of new products and
in the  improvement  of  existing  products  in the  years  ended
2001  2000 and 1999  respectively  there  can be no  assurance
that  dentsply  will be able to  continue  to develop  innovative
products and that  regulatory  approval of any new products  will
be  obtained  or that  if  such  approvals  are  obtained  such
products will be accepted in the marketplace

operating and technical expertise

   dentsply  believes  that its  manufacturing  capabilities  are
important  to its  success  the  company  continues  to automate
its  global  manufacturing  operations  in order to  remain a low
cost producer

   the   manufacture   of   the   companys   products   requires
substantial and varied  technical  expertise  complex  materials
technology  and  processes  are  necessary  to  manufacture   the
companys products

    dentsply  has  completed  or has in  progress a number of key
initiatives  around  the world that are  focused  on helping  the
company improve its operating margins

o     the companys primary operational  initiative over the next
   12  years  will  be  to  successfully  integrate  the  recent
   acquisitions

o     the  company  has  recently  acquired a plant site  outside
   chicago  where it will  establish a major  dental  anesthetic
   filling  plant  the company  believes  that the plant will be
   operational   which   includes  the  fda  validation  of  the
   manufacturing practices at the end of 2003

o     the company is creating a corporate  quality and purchasing
   initiative   to  help  ensure   product   quality  and  reduce
   purchased product costs throughout the organization

o     the   company   has   centralized   its   warehousing   and
   distribution   in  north   america  and   europe   this  will
   minimize   both   inventory   levels  and  multiple   customer
   shipments  it also  helps  improve  product  forecasting  and
   service to our customers

o     in the first quarter of 2001 dentsply  reorganized certain
   functions  within  europe  brazil and north  america with the
   objective   of   consolidating   duplicative   functions   and
   improving  efficiencies  within these regions  these measures
   have  resulted  in  the  elimination  of   approximately   310
   administrative  and  manufacturing  positions  in  brazil  and
   germany most aspects of this plan have been completed

o     the   company   continues   to  focus  on   improving   its
   manufacturing   processes  at  several  of  its  manufacturing
   locations  providing  improved  flexibility  this will allow
   them to continue to reduce  inventories  and improve  response
   times to changes in customer demand

o     dentsply  has also  completed  its  north  american  shared
   service   initiative   focused   on  the   consolidation   and
   centralization   of   the   financial    accounting    support
   functions

o     dentsply is making significant  improvements in information
   technology  as  well  the  new  manufacturing  and  financial
   accounting  system was  implemented  in 1999 and  provides the
   company  with  common  software  systems for nearly all of its
   locations  around the world  excluding  friadent  and  degussa
   dental  worldwide  telecommunications  are  currently  a  key
   focus as we continue to drive efficiencies

financing

   dentsplys  longterm  debt at  december  31  2001 was 7235
million and the related  longterm  debt to total  capitalization
was 543  dentsply  may incur  additional  debt in the  future
including the funding of additional  acquisitions  however  the
companys  primary  focus  in  2002  is  the  integration  of its
already   competed   acquisitions  and  the  repayment  of  debt
dentsplys  ability to make payments on its indebtedness  and to
fund  its  operations  depends  on  its  future  performance  and
financial  results  which to a certain  extent  are subject to
general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other
factors  that are beyond its  control  there can be no assurance
that  dentsplys  business  will  generate  sufficient  cash flow
from  operations  in the future to service  its debt and  operate
its business

   dentsplys   existing  borrowing   documentation   contains  a
number of  covenants  and  financial  ratios which it is required
to  satisfy  any breach of any such  covenants  or  restrictions
would  result  in  a  default   under  the   existing   borrowing
documentation  that  would  permit the  lenders  to  declare  all
borrowings  under such  documentation  to be immediately  due and
payable and  through  cross  default  provisions  would entitle
dentsplys  other  lenders to  accelerate  their loans  dentsply
may not be able to meet its  obligations  under  its  outstanding
indebtedness  in the event that any cross  default  provision  is
triggered

   additional   information  about  dentsplys  working  capital
liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  incorporated   herein  by

operations in the companys 2001 annual report to shareholders

competition

   the  company  conducts  its  operations   both  domestic  and
foreign    under   highly    competitive    market   conditions
competition in the dental  products  industry is based  primarily
upon  product  performance  quality  safety and ease of use as
well as price  customer  service  innovation  and acceptance by
professionals   and  technicians   dentsply  believes  that  its
principal  strengths  include its  wellestablished  brand names
its reputation for  highquality  and  innovative  products  its
leadership  in product  development  and  manufacturing  and its
commitment to customer service and technical support

   the size  and  number  of the  companys  competitors  vary by
product   line  and  from  region  to  region   there  are  many
companies  that produce  some  but not all of the same types of
products   as  those   produced  by  the   company   certain  of
dentsplys  competitors may have greater  resources than does the
company in certain of its product offerings

   the  worldwide  market for dental  supplies  and  equipment is
highly  competitive  there can be no assurance  that the company
will   successfully   identify  new  product   opportunities  and
develop  and  market  new  products  successfully  or  that  new
products and  technologies  introduced  by  competitors  will not
render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive

regulation

   the  companys  products are subject to  regulation  by among
other  governmental  entities  the united  states  food and drug
administration  the  fda  in general  if a dental  device
is  subject  to  fda   regulation   compliance  with  the  fdas
requirements  constitutes  compliance  with  corresponding  state
regulations   in   order  to   ensure   that   dental   products
distributed  for  human  use in the  united  states  are safe and
effective  the  fda  regulates  the  introduction  manufacture
advertising  labeling  packaging  marketing  and  distribution
of and recordkeeping for such products

   dental  devices of the types sold by  dentsply  are  generally
classified  by the fda into a category  that renders them subject
only to  general  controls  that  apply to all  medical  devices
including   regulations   regarding   alteration    misbranding
notification  recordkeeping and good  manufacturing  practices
dentsplys  facilities are subject to periodic  inspection by the
fda to monitor  dentsplys  compliance  with  these  regulations
there  can  be  no   assurance   that  the  fda  will  not  raise
compliance  concerns  failure to satisfy  fda  requirements  can
result in fda enforcement  actions  including  product  seizure
injunction   andor  criminal  or  civil   proceedings   in  the
european  union  dentsplys  products are subject to the medical
devices  laws of the various  member  states which are based on a
directive  of  the  european  commission   such  laws  generally
regulate  the safety of the  products in a similar way to the fda
regulations  dentsply  products  in  europe  bear  the  ce  sign
showing that such products adhere to the european regulations

   all  dental  amalgam   filling   materials   including  those
manufactured  and  sold by  dentsply  contain  mercury  various
groups have alleged  that dental  amalgam  containing  mercury is
harmful  to human  health  and have  actively  lobbied  state and
federal   lawmakers   and   regulators  to  pass  laws  or  adopt
regulatory  changes  restricting  the use or requiring a warning
against alleged  potential risks of dental  amalgams  the fdas
dental devices  classification  panel the national institutes of
health and the united  states  public  health  service  have each
indicated  that no  direct  hazard  to humans  from  exposure  to
dental  amalgams  has  been  demonstrated  if the  fda  were  to
reclassify  dental  mercury  and  amalgam  filling  materials  as
classes of products  requiring  fda  premarket  approval  there
can  be  no  assurance  that  the  required   approval  would  be
obtained  or that the fda  would  permit  the  continued  sale of
amalgam filling materials pending its  determination  in europe
in  particular  in  scandinavia  and  germany  the  contents  of
mercury  in amalgam  filling  materials  had been the  subject of
public  discussion  as a consequence  in 1994 the german health
authorities  asked  suppliers  of dental  amalgam to amend  as a
precautionary  measure  the  instructions  for use  for  amalgam
filling  materials  dentsply  adhered to this request  dentsply
also   manufactures   and  sells   nonamalgam   dental   filling
materials that do not contain mercury

   the  introduction  and sale of  dental  products  of the types
produced  by  the  company   are  also   subject  to   government
regulation  in the various  foreign  countries  in which they are
produced  or sold  some of  these  regulatory  requirements  are
more  stringent  than  those  applicable  in the  united  states
dentsply  believes that it is in substantial  compliance with the
foreign  regulatory  requirements  that  are  applicable  to  its
products and manufacturing operations

sources and supply of raw materials

  all  of  the  raw   materials   used  by  the  company  in  the
manufacture   of  its   products  are   purchased   from  various
suppliers and are  available  from  numerous  sources  no single
supplier   except  for  the  supplier  of  precious   metal  raw
materials  accounts for a  significant  percentage of dentsplys
raw material  requirements  there are  alternative  suppliers of
precious metal raw materials readily available

intellectual property

   products  manufactured  by dentsply are sold  primarily  under
its own  trademarks  and  trade  names  dentsply  also  owns and
maintains  more than 1000  patents  throughout  the world and is
licensed under a small number of patents owned by others

   dentsplys  policy is to protect its products  and  technology
through  patents  and  trademark   registrations  in  the  united
states  and  in   significant   international   markets  for  its
products   the  company   carefully   monitors   trademark   use
worldwide   and   promotes   enforcement   of  its  patents  and
trademarks  in a manner  that is  designed to balance the cost of
such  protection  against  obtaining  the greatest  value for the
company    dentsply   believes   its   patents   and   trademark
properties   are  important  and   contribute  to  the  companys
marketing   position   but  it  does  not  consider  its  overall
business to be materially  dependent upon any  individual  patent
or trademark

employed  approximately  7500  employees  a small percentage of
the  companys   employees  are   represented  by  labor  unions

unions  the  company  believes  that its  relationship  with its
employees is good

   the companys  success is dependent  upon its  management  and
employees  the  loss  of  senior  management  employees  or  any
failure  to  recruit  and  train  needed  managerial  sales  and
technical  personnel could have a material  adverse effect on the
company

environmental matters

respects  with  applicable  environmental  laws and  regulations
maintaining  this  level of  compliance  has not had  and is not
expected  to have  a material  effect on the  companys  capital
expenditures or on its business

party will not have a material adverse effect upon its

department  of  justice  initiated  an  antitrust   investigation
regarding  the policies and conduct  undertaken  by the companys
trubyte  division with respect to the  distribution of artificial
teeth and  related  products  on january 5 1999 the  department
of justice  filed a  complaint  against  the  company in the us
district  court  in  wilmington   delaware   alleging  that  the
companys  tooth  distribution  practices  violate the  antitrust
laws and  seeking  an order for the  company to  discontinue  its
practices   three  follow  on  private  class  action  suits  on
behalf  of  dentists   laboratories   and  denture  patients  in
seventeen  states  respectively  who purchased trubyte teeth or
products  containing  trubyte teeth  were filed and  transferred
to the us  district  court in wilmington  delaware  the class
action  filed on behalf of the  dentists  has been  dismissed  by
the  plaintiffs  the  private  party  suits  seek  damages in an
unspecified   amount  the  company  filed  motions  for  summary
judgment  in all of the above  cases  which  were  argued to the
court in december  2000  the court denied the  companys  motion
for  summary   judgment   regarding  the  department  of  justice
action  granted  the  motion  on the  lack  of  standing  of the
patient  class  action  and  granted  the  motion  on the lack of
standing  of  the  laboratory   class  action  to  pursue  damage
claims  in an  attempt  to  avoid  the  effect  of  the  courts
ruling  the  attorneys for the  laboratory  class action filed a
new    complaint    naming    dentsply   and   its   dealers   as
coconspirators  with respect to dentsplys  distribution policy
the company  filed a motion to dismiss this  refiled  complaint
the  court  again  granted  dentsplys  motion  on  the  lack  of
standing  of  the  laboratory   class  action  to  pursue  damage
claims  the  attorneys  for the patient  class have also filed a
new  action  to avoid  the  effect of the  courts  ruling  this
action  is filed in the us  district  court in  delaware  four
private  party  class  actions on behalf of  indirect  purchasers
were filed in  california  state court  these cases are based on
allegations  similar  to  those  in  the  department  of  justice
case  in  response  to the  companys  motion  these cases have
been  consolidated  in one judicial  district in los angeles  it
is the  companys  position  that the conduct and  activities  of

incorporated herein by reference

   although  its  sales  are  made  primarily  to  distributors  dealers  and
importers  dentsply  focuses its  marketing  efforts on the  dentists  dental
hygienists  dental assistants  dental laboratories and dental schools who are
the  end  users  of its  products  as part of  this  enduser  pull  through
marketing   approach   dentsply   employs   nearly   1100   highly   trained
productspecific   sales  and   technical   staffs  to  provide   comprehensive
marketing and service  tailored to the particular  sales and technical  support

   dentsply  believes  that  demand in a given  geographic  market  for  dental
procedures and products varies  according to the stage of social  economic and
technical  development  that the market has  attained  geographic  markets for
dentsplys  dental products can be categorized  into the following three stages
of development

   the united states  canada  western europe the united kingdom  japan and
australia are highly  developed  markets that demand the most  advanced  dental
procedures  and products and have the highest  level of  expenditure  on dental
care  in  these  markets  the  focus  of  dental  care is  increasingly  upon
preventive  care and  specialized  dentistry  in addition to basic  procedures
such as the  excavation  and  filling  of  cavities  and tooth  extraction  and
denture  replacement  dental  professionals  perform an  increasing  volume of
preventive and cosmetic  procedures  these markets  require varied and complex
dental products  utilize sophisticated  diagnostic and imaging equipment  and
demand high levels of attention to  protection  against  infection  and patient
crosscontamination

   in certain countries in central america  south america and the pacific rim
dental care is often  limited to the  excavation  and  filling of cavities  and
other restorative  techniques  reflecting more modest per capita  expenditures
for dental care  these markets  demand  diverse  products such as high and low
speed  handpieces   restorative   compounds   finishing  devices  and  custom
restorative devices

   in the peoples republic of china  india  eastern europe the countries of
the former soviet union  and other developing  countries  dental ailments are
treated  primarily  through tooth  extraction  and denture  replacement  these
procedures  require basic surgical  instruments  artificial teeth for dentures
and bridgework and anchoring devices such as posts

   the company  offers  products  and  equipment  for use in markets at each of
these  stages  of  development  the  company  believes  that as each of  these
markets develop  demand for more technically  advanced products will increase
the company also believes  that its  recognized  brand names  high quality and
innovative  products  technical  support  services  and  strong  international
distribution   capabilities   position  it  well  to  take   advantage  of  any
opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves

      the following  trends  support the  companys  confidence in its industry
growth outlook

      increasing  worldwide population  population growth continues throughout
      the world

      growth  of the  population  65 or older  the  percentage  of the  united
      states and european  population  over age 65 is expected to nearly double
      by the year 2030  in  addition  to having  significant  needs for dental
      care the elderly are well positioned to pay for the required  procedures
      since they control sizable amounts of discretionary income

      natural  teeth are being  retained  longer   according  to the  princeton
      dental resource centers study on oral health and aging individuals with
      natural  teeth are over four times as likely to visit a dentist in a given
      year than those without any natural teeth remaining

      the  changing  dental  practice in  developed  countries   dentistry  in
      developed  countries  has been  transformed  from a profession  primarily
      dealing  with  pain  infections  and tooth  decay to one with  increased
      emphasis on preventive care and cosmetic  dentistry  dentsplys  product
      lines are well  positioned  to provide  the new  sophisticated  solutions
      that these advanced procedures require

      per capita and  discretionary  incomes are increasing in emerging nations
       as personal  incomes  continue to rise in the  emerging  nations of the
      pacific rim and latin america  healthcare  including dental services are
      a growing priority

      growth in the field of aesthetic  dentistry  those among the aging baby
      boomer  population  are not only keeping  their natural teeth longer but
      are  interested  in looking their best  increasing  the demand for tooth
      whitening and other aesthetic procedures

   the size and number of the  companys  competitors  vary by product line and
from region to region  there are many  companies  that produce  some  but not
all of the same types of products as those  produced by the  company  certain
of dentsplys  competitors may have greater  resources than does the company in
certain of its product offerings

regulation

   the  companys   products  are  subject  to   regulation   by  among  other
governmental  entities  the united  states food and drug  administration  the
fda  in  general  if a  dental  device  is  subject  to fda  regulation
compliance   with  the   fdas   requirements   constitutes   compliance   with
corresponding  state  regulations  in order to  ensure  that  dental  products
distributed  for human use in the  united  states are safe and  effective  the
fda   regulates   the   introduction   manufacture   advertising   labeling
packaging   marketing  and  distribution  of  and  recordkeeping  for  such
products

   dental devices of the types sold by the company are generally  classified by
the fda into a category  that renders  them  subject  only to general  controls
that  apply  to  all   medical   devices   including   regulations   regarding
alteration  misbranding  notification  recordkeeping and good manufacturing
practices   the  company   believes  that  it  is  in   compliance   with  fda
regulations applicable to its products and manufacturing operations

   all dental amalgam filling materials  including those manufactured and sold
by the  company  contain  mercury  various  groups have  alleged  that dental
amalgam  containing  mercury  is  harmful  to human  health  and have  actively
lobbied  state  and  federal  lawmakers  and  regulators  to pass laws or adopt
regulatory  changes  restricting  the  use  or  requiring  a  warning  against
alleged  potential  risks  of  dental  amalgams   the  fdas  dental  devices
classification  panel the national  institutes of health and the united states
public  health  service  have each  indicated  that no direct  hazard to humans
from  exposure to dental  amalgams has been  demonstrated  to them  if the fda
were to reclassify  dental mercury and amalgam filling  materials as classes of
products requiring fda premarket  approval  there can be no assurance that the
required  approval  would  be  obtained  or  that  the  fda  would  permit  the
continued  sale  of  amalgam  filling  materials  pending  its   determination
dentsply also  manufactures  and sells  nonamalgam  dental  filling  materials
that do not contain mercury

   the  introduction  and sale of dental  products of the types produced by the
company  are also  subject to  government  regulation  in the  various  foreign
countries  in  which  they are  produced  or  sold  some of  these  regulatory
requirements  are more  stringent  than those  applicable in the united states
dentsply  believes  that  it is in  substantial  compliance  with  the  foreign
regulatory  requirements  that are applicable to its products and manufacturing
operations

sources and supply of raw materials

  all of the  raw  materials  used by the  company  in the  manufacture  of its
products are purchased  from various  suppliers and are available from numerous
sources   no  single  supplier  accounts  for  a  significant   percentage  of
dentsplys raw material requirements

trademarks and patents

   products   manufactured  by  dentsply  are  sold  primarily  under  its  own
trademarks  and trade  names  the  company  also owns and  maintains  numerous
patents  throughout  the world and is licensed  under a small number of patents
owned by others

   dentsplys policy is to protect its products and technology  through patents
and  trademark   registrations   in  the  united  states  and  in   significant
international  markets  for  its  products   the  company  carefully  monitors
trademark  use  worldwide   and  promotes   enforcement  of  its  patents  and
trademarks  in  a  manner  that  is  designed  to  balance  the  cost  of  such
protection  against  obtaining  the greatest  value for the  company  dentsply
believes its patents and trademark  properties  are important and contribute to
the  companys  marketing  position  but  it  does  not  consider  its  overall
business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark

working capital practices

   information  about  dentsplys   working  capital   liquidity  and  capital
resources  is  incorporated  herein  by  reference  to the  material  under the
caption   managements  discussion  and  analysis of financial  condition  and
results of operations in the companys 2000 annual report to shareholders

employees

   as  of  december  31  2000  the  company  and  its  subsidiaries  employed
approximately  6150 employees  a small percentage of the companys  employees
are  represented  by labor unions  hourly  workers at the  companys  ransom 
randolph  facility  in  maumee  ohio are  represented  by local  no 12 of the
international  union  united automobile  aerospace and agriculture  implement
workers of america  under a  collective  bargaining  agreement  that expires on
january 31 2004  hourly  workers at the  companys  midwest  dental  products
facility in des plaines  illinois are  represented  by tool  die makers local
113 of the  international  association  of  machinists  and  aerospace  workers
under a  collective  bargaining  agreement  that  expires on june 1 2003  the
company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

environmental matters

   dentsply  believes that its operations  comply in all material respects with
applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  maintaining  this  level of
compliance  has not had and is not expected to have a material  effect on the
companys capital expenditures or on its business

additional factors that may affect future results

rate of growth

   the  companys  ability to  continue  to increase  revenues  depends  upon a
number of  factors  among  those  factors are the rate of growth in the market
for dental  supplies and  equipment  the ability of the company to continue to
develop innovative and  costeffective  new products  the acceptance by dental
professionals of new products and  technologies  and the companys  ability to
complete  acquisitions  the  demand  for  dental  services  can  be  adversely
affected by economic conditions  healthcare reform  government  regulation or
more stringent  limits in expenditures  by dental  insurance  providers  there
is  also  a  risk  that  dental   professionals  may  resist  new  products  or
technologies or may not be able to obtain  reimbursement  from dental insurance
providers for the use of new procedures or equipment

acquisitions

   in 2000 the company  completed  five  acquisitions  in the first  quarter of
2001  the company  completed  two  acquisitions  and entered  into a definitive
agreement to acquire a third company  these acquisitions  involve a substantial
degree of risk the acquisitions are expected to result in benefits to dentsply
including  expanding  the  products  and  services  offered by  dentsply  to its
customers and  potential  customers  and  enhancing  dentsplys  presence in the
european market for dental products achieving the benefits of the acquisitions
however  will depend on a number of factors  including the  integration of the
operations and personnel of dentsply and the acquired  companies in a timely and
efficient  manner  the integration will be complicated by the need to integrate
geographically  diverse  operations  in general  the company  cannot offer any
assurances  that  it can  successfully  integrate  or  realize  the  anticipated
benefits of the  acquisitions  failure to do so could result in the loss of key
personnel  and have a material  adverse  effect on the acquired  businesses  and
dentsplys financial condition and operating results in addition the attention
and  effort  devoted  to  the  integration  of  the  acquired   companies  could
significantly divert managements attention from other important tasks and could
seriously  harm  dentsply  also  there  can be no  assurance  that  regulatory
approval of any new products  will be obtained  or that if such  approvals  are
obtained  such  products  will be  accepted  in the  marketplace  other  risks
include

                                       8
page

     unanticipated expenses related to technology integration

     difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and
        policies

     the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result
        of any integration of new management personnel and

     potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses

   dentsply has acquired and may in the future acquire complementary  businesses
or technologies  if appropriate  opportunities  present themselves  additional
businesses or products may be acquired and any such acquisitions may be material
in size  the company may not be able to  successfully  identify  negotiate  or
finance any future acquisitions

   dentsply may not succeed in addressing  the risks or problems  encountered in
connection with any future business combinations and acquisitions

fluctuating operating results

   the  companys  business is subject to  quarterly  variations  in  operating
results caused by seasonality and by business and industry  conditions  making
operating  results more difficult to predict  the timing of acquisitions  the
impact  of   purchase   accounting   adjustments   and   consolidations   among
distributors   of  the  companys   products  may  also  affect  the  companys
operating results in any particular period

currency translation and international business risks

   because  approximately 40 of the companys  revenues have been generated in
currencies  other  than the us  dollar  the  value  of the  us  dollar  in
relation to those  currencies  affects the  companys  operating  results  the
impact of foreign  currency  fluctuations  in any given period can be favorable
or  unfavorable   if  the  us  dollar   strengthens  in  relation  to  other
currencies  the  companys  revenues  and  operating  results are likely to be
adversely  affected  in addition  approximately 42 of the companys revenues
result  from sales in markets  outside  of the united  states  europe has been
an important  market for the company  and although asia and south america have
not  historically  been the source of  significant  revenues  the  company has
made  investments in asian and south american  markets because it believes that
longterm   future  growth  prospects  in  these  geographic  areas  are  good
weakness in economic  conditions  in europe  asia or south america could have
a material  adverse  effect on the  companys  sales  operating  results  and
future rate of growth

margin improvements

   the company  strives to increase  its margins by  controlling  its costs and
improving  manufacturing  efficiencies  however  there  can  be no  assurance
that the  companys  efforts  will  continue to be  successful  margins can be
adversely affected by many factors  including  competition  product mix cost
of materials and labor and the effect of acquisitions

ability to attract and retain personnel

   the companys  success is dependent upon its  management and employees  the
loss of  senior  management  employees  or any  failure  to  recruit  and train
needed  managerial  sales  and  technical  personnel  could  have  a  material
adverse effect on the company

competition

   the   worldwide   market  for  dental   supplies  and  equipment  is  highly
competitive  there can be no  assurance  that the  company  will  successfully
identify  new  product  opportunities  and  develop  and  market  new  products
successfully  or that new products and technologies  introduced by competitors
will not render the companys products obsolete or noncompetitive

antitakeover provisions

   certain  provisions  of  the  companys  certificate  of  incorporation  and
bylaws and of delaware  law could have the effect of making it  difficult  for
a third party to acquire control of the company  such  provisions  include the
division of the board of  directors  of the company  into three  classes  with
the  threeyear  term of a class  expiring each year a provision  allowing the
board of directors to issue  preferred  stock having  rights senior to those of
the common stock and certain  procedural  requirements  which make it difficult
for   stockholders   to  amend  the  companys   bylaws  and  which   preclude
stockholders  from  calling  special  meetings of  stockholders  in  addition
members  of  the  companys   management  and  participants  in  the  companys
employee  stock  ownership  plan  collectively  own  approximately  15  of the
outstanding  common  stock of the company  which may  discourage a third party
from  attempting  to acquire  control of the company in a  transaction  that is
opposed by the companys management and employees

item 3  legal proceedings

   dentsply  and its  subsidiaries  are from time to time  parties to  lawsuits
arising  out  of  their  respective  operations   the  company  believes  that
pending  litigation  to which  dentsply  is a party  will  not have a  material
adverse  effect  upon  its  consolidated   financial  position  or  results  of
operations

   in june 1995  the  antitrust  division of the united  states  department of
justice  initiated  an  antitrust  investigation  regarding  the  policies  and
conduct  undertaken  by the  companys  trubyte  division  with  respect to the
distribution  of  artificial  teeth and  related  products  on january 5 1999
the  department  of justice  filed a complaint  against the company in the us
district  court in  wilmington  delaware  alleging  that the  companys  tooth
distribution  practices  violate  the  antitrust  laws and seeking an order for
the  company to  discontinue  its  practices  three  follow on  private  class
action  suits on behalf of  dentists  laboratories  and  denture  patients  in
seventeen  states  respectively  who  purchased  trubyte  teeth  or  products
containing  trubyte  teeth  were  filed and  transferred  to the us  district
court in  wilmington  delaware  these  cases have been  assigned  to the same
judge who is  handling  the  department  of justice  action  the class  action
filed on behalf of the  dentists  has been  dismissed  by the  plaintiffs  the
private  party suits seek  damages in an  unspecified  amount  the company has
filed  motions  for summary  judgment  in all of the above cases which  motions
were argued  december 8 2000  four private  party class  actions on behalf of
indirect  purchasers  have  been  filed in  california  state  court  recently
these  cases are based on  allegations  similar to those in the  department  of
justice  case  the company  has filed  motions to  consolidate  these cases in
one  judicial  district  it is the  companys  position  that the  conduct and
activities of the trubyte division do not violate the antitrust laws
